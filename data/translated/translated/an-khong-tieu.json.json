    "content": "What disease is indigestion? Causes, symptoms and prevention\n\nIndigestion is a common condition that everyone has encountered in their life. The main cause is usually due to stomach acid and a number of other factors, such as: diet, side effects of medications... Sometimes, this is a typical sign of some dangerous diseases that need to be treated. Treat promptly to avoid complications.\n\nWhat is indigestion?\nIndigestion is a condition of pain and discomfort in the abdominal area that occurs after eating, due to problems with the digestive process in the stomach. Symptoms experienced in each person are often not completely the same, appearing often or occasionally depending on the case.\nThis is not a specific disease, sometimes it is a symptom of a medical problem. Most indigestion symptoms usually improve significantly after lifestyle changes and medication. In some severe cases, this condition can be a warning sign of an underlying digestive disease that requires prompt treatment.\nSymptoms of indigestion usually appear within a few minutes to a few hours after eating. In fact, the stomach needs 3 - 5 hours to completely digest the food consumed, then move it to the intestines. During that time, the pancreas and gallbladder send fluids and enzymes to the stomach to support this activity. These are organs in the epigastric region - where indigestion symptoms often occur.\nPeople with indigestion often have stomach pain after eating\n\nWhat disease is frequent indigestion?\nSymptoms of indigestion that appear frequently are at risk of being related to dangerous digestive diseases, such as:\nGastric ulcer disease.; Gastroesophageal reflux disease; Gastritis.; Gastroparesis (Gastroparesis).; Hiatal hernia.; Gallstones.; Cholecystitis.; Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis).; Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).; Celiac disease.; Small bowel obstruction; Stomach cancer .\n\nCause of indigestion\nMost cases of indigestion are related to stomach acid. Specifically, the organ always has a strong mucosal layer, performing the task of protecting the surface from the effects of acids. When this layer is eroded, under the influence of acid, the stomach is easily irritated, leading to inflammation. Some other causes may also occur but are usually insignificant.\nSometimes, stomach fluids spill out, moving into the top part of the small intestine. This organ does not have a protective mucosal layer so it is more susceptible to damage. Acid can also reflux from the stomach into the esophagus, called acid reflux.(1)\nThis condition is also often accompanied by some symptoms of indigestion, such as: belching, heartburn... Patients can experience acid reflux and discomfort in the esophagus even when the stomach lining is still intact. . However, if acid erodes this protective layer, there is a high risk of causing stomach and duodenal ulcers. At this time, some symptoms of indigestion may occur, including: early satiety, nausea, bloating...\nSome other factors that also contribute to indigestion include:\nEating too much or too fast: These are all bad habits that increase pressure on the stomach, making it easier for acid to escape.; Eating too much or too fast: These are all bad habits that increase pressure on the stomach, making it easier for acid to escape.\nDiet too high in fat: High fat content will stimulate the production of acids and enzymes, causing irritation to tissues in the digestive tract.; Diet too high in fat: High fat content will stimulate the production of acids and enzymes, causing irritation to tissues in the digestive tract.\nFood intolerance: Indigestion can occur when eating certain foods that the body has difficulty tolerating.; Food intolerance: Indigestion can occur when eating certain foods that the body finds difficult to tolerate.\nSmoking and drinking alcohol: Harmful substances in cigarettes and alcohol will irritate the lining of the digestive tract, leading to inflammation.; Smoking and drinking alcohol: Harmful substances in cigarettes and alcohol will irritate the lining of the digestive tract, leading to inflammation.\nAbuse of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aspirin, ibuprofen...): This can cause the stomach lining to erode.; Abuse of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aspirin, ibuprofen...): This can cause the stomach lining to erode.\nStress and anxiety: The digestive tract is closely connected to the brain through nerves, so stress and anxiety can also lead to indigestion.; Stress and anxiety: The digestive tract is closely connected to the brain through nerves, so stress and anxiety can also lead to indigestion.\nStomach acid is one of the main causes of indigestion\n\nMethod for diagnosing indigestion\nWith indigestion, the doctor will initially conduct a physical examination and review specific symptoms. If the condition is severe or the person is over 55 years old, some of the following tests may be ordered, including:\nBlood tests.; Stool test.; Breath test.; Endoscopy to check for abnormalities in the digestive tract.; Imaging tests (X-ray, CT).\n\nHow to cure indigestion\nIndigestion often improves after taking medication and changing your diet and lifestyle. As follows:\n1. Use medicine\nOver-the-counter (OTC) antacids: Antacids neutralize stomach acid to avoid irritating tissues. However, patients should not use it too often; Over-the-counter (OTC) antacids: Antacids neutralize stomach acid to avoid irritating tissues. However, patients should not use it too often.\nH2 blockers: This group of drugs reduces stomach acid by inhibiting the body's production of histamine. They can be used more frequently than over-the-counter antacids but the effects do not last as long.; H2 blockers: This group of drugs reduces stomach acid by inhibiting the body's production of histamine. They can be used more frequently than over-the-counter antacids, but the effects do not last as long.\nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs): Proton pump inhibitors have the ability to block stronger acid production while effectively promoting tissue healing. This type is often prescribed when indigestion symptoms are relatively severe, there are signs of tissue damage or ulcers in the digestive tract.(2); Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): Proton pump inhibitors have the ability to block stronger acid production while effectively promoting tissue healing. This type is often prescribed when indigestion symptoms are relatively severe, there are signs of tissue damage or ulcers in the digestive tract.(2)\n2. Change your diet and lifestyle\nChanging your diet and lifestyle appropriately is also a solution to help control indigestion, including:\nAvoid consuming foods that cause indigestion: spicy foods, high fat foods...; Divide your diet into small meals throughout the day instead of eating large meals; Give up the habit of using drinks containing caffeine, alcohol, etc.; Avoid using some pain relievers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium...; Control stress, avoid anxiety.\n\nWhen should I see a doctor?\nMild indigestion is usually not a cause for concern. However, if the condition is serious, occurs frequently and lasts for a long time with the following symptoms, the patient should immediately contact a doctor:\nUncontrolled weight loss; Anorexia.; Vomiting a lot, vomiting blood; Stools are tarry in color; Difficulty swallowing.; Iron deficiency anemia without identifiable cause.\nBelow are emergencies where patients need immediate medical attention:\nDifficulty breathing with sweating; Chest pain spreading to the jaw, neck or arms; Chest pain with exertion or stress.\nSee your doctor if you notice that your indigestion is getting worse\n\nHow to prevent indigestion\nThe prevention of indigestion has been shown to be significantly effective through daily dietary management. Some useful solutions that can be referred to include: (3)\nEat many small meals throughout the day to avoid reducing pressure on the stomach.; Do not talk, watch movies, or read books while eating; Limit eating foods containing high acid content, such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, etc.; Avoid eating hot and spicy foods; Reduce or avoid consuming foods and beverages containing caffeine; Relax, control stress.; Quit smoking and alcohol to avoid irritating the stomach lining; Avoid wearing tight clothing because it easily compresses the stomach, causing substances inside the organ to enter the esophagus.; You should not exercise when you have just eaten, you should only exercise before meals or at least one hour after eating.; Do not lie down immediately after eating; Avoid eating late at night, eat at least 3 hours before bed.; Sleep with your head higher than your feet and use a pillow for support to help digestive fluids flow into the intestines instead of refluxing into the esophagus.; Control and maintain a reasonable weight to avoid putting pressure on the stomach and esophagus.; Eat slowly, chew thoroughly.\nEating slowly and chewing thoroughly is a useful way to prevent indigestion\n\nFrequently asked questions when indigestion\nHere are answers to some common questions about indigestion:\n1. What to drink if you have indigestion?\nFor indigestion, in addition to taking all the medications prescribed by the doctor (Histamine blockers, antacids), etc., patients should supplement some of the following beneficial drinks:\nFiltered water: Patients should drink 8 glasses of filtered water a day to dilute stomach acid.; Herbal teas: Chamomile tea, lavender tea, ginger tea... can help soothe the digestive system.\n2. What should I do if I have indigestion?\nMild indigestion can be effectively improved through reasonable and healthy lifestyle changes, including:\nEat smaller, more frequent meals; Chew food slowly and thoroughly.; Avoid consuming foods that irritate the digestive system, such as: spicy foods, fatty foods, processed foods, carbonated drinks, caffeine, alcohol...; Quit the habit of smoking; Maintain a reasonable weight to avoid putting pressure on the abdomen.; Exercise regularly to help control weight and promote better digestion.; Stress management.; Change your medications, typically pain relievers that irritate the stomach lining.; If a patient is diagnosed with indigestion due to a specific disease, the most important thing is to treat it completely.\n3. Does indigestion cause any effects?\nIndigestion is common and usually not serious. However, if the condition occurs continuously and for a long time, this may be a warning sign of an underlying disease. This also affects the quality of daily life, typically feelings of discomfort and loss of appetite. Therefore, as soon as patients notice symptoms of indigestion, they should see a doctor early to receive effective treatment.\n4. What to eat for easy digestion?\nFood plays a very important role in the health of the digestive system. Below are some easy-to-digest foods that you should consider adding to your daily menu:\nToasted bread.; Rice.; Banana.; Applesauce.; Egg.; Sweet potato.; Chicken.; Salmon.; Pretzels.; Oatmeal.; Low-fat, low-sugar vegetables that are good for the digestive system: Green beans, broccoli, asparagus, cauliflower, green leafy vegetables, potatoes, cucumbers...\nPrioritize foods that are good for the digestive system to avoid indigestion\nThe Center for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City) and the Department of General Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing medical examination services. and advanced, effective treatment for patients with mild to severe liver problems (fatty liver, acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer...).
