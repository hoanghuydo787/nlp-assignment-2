    "content": "Anal abscess: Causes, symptoms and prevention\n\nAnal abscess is a common condition, causing pain and directly affecting daily activities. The disease comes from many different causes, manifests itself with easily recognizable symptoms, and can cause a number of serious complications if not treated early. Therefore, as soon as patients notice unusual signs, they should immediately contact their doctor for timely diagnosis and treatment.\n\nWhat is an anal abscess?\nAn anal abscess is a condition in which the cavity near the anus or rectum fills with pus, causing pain to the patient. Most cases are caused by acute infection of the internal glands. Sometimes, bacteria, feces or foreign objects can also block the anal gland, penetrate the surrounding tissue and then collect in the cavity, causing an abscess.(1)\nClassification of abscesses\nAbscesses are classified based on the location of formation, related to structures around the rectum and anus, including:\nPerianal abscess: This is the most common type, accounting for up to 60% of cases. Perianal abscesses often appear as pus under the skin, are painful, swollen, red and feel warm to the touch.; Perianal abscess: This is the most common type, accounting for up to 60% of cases. Perianal abscesses often appear as pus under the skin, are painful, swollen, red and feel warm to the touch.\nIschiorectal fossa abscess: This is the second most common type of abscess, formed by compression through the external anal sphincter, entering the rectum. In some cases, the abscess can spread to the deep space behind the anus, entering the side to form a horseshoe abscess.; Ischiorectal fossa abscess: This is the second most common type of abscess, formed by compression through the external anal sphincter, entering the rectum. In some cases, the abscess can spread to the deep space behind the anus, entering the side to form a horseshoe abscess.\nIntersphincteric abscess: This is the result of compression between the internal and external anal sphincters. This type of abscess can be completely located in the anal canal, causing symptoms of severe pain, only detected during rectal examination or digital endoscopy.; Intersphincteric abscess: This is the result of compression between the internal and external anal sphincters. This type of abscess can be completely located in the anal canal, causing symptoms of severe pain, only detected during a rectal examination or digital endoscopy.\nSuprasphincteric abscess: This is the least common type, causing pelvic and rectal pain, often diagnosed by computed tomography (CT).; Suprasphincteric abscess: This is the least common type, causes pelvic and rectal pain, and is often diagnosed with computed tomography (CT).\n\nSubjects susceptible to anal abscess\nAnal abscesses often occur in subjects in the following risk groups:\nMen (men are twice as likely to develop anal abscess as women).; People with the following diseases: Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, enteritis, diabetes, constipation, diarrhea.; The immune system is affected by HIV/AIDS infection; Anal sex.; Use of Prednisone or other Steroids; People who have been or are undergoing chemotherapy.; Use of immunosuppressive drugs; Smoking habit.; Diabetes.\n\nCauses of anal abscess\nAnal abscesses arise from many different causes, mainly due to infection, specifically as follows:(2)\nAnal gland infection is caused by the colonization of aerobic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus and Escherichia coli) and anaerobic bacteria (Acteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas and Clostridium).; Injury.; Suffering from the following diseases: Crohn's disease, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases, enteritis, cancer...; Anal gland obstruction.; Using some medications to treat anorectal diseases incorrectly or using them for a long time causes tissue inflammation.; The anus, rectum, urethra... had undergone minor surgery but the medical instruments were not sterile leading to infection and abscess formation.\n\nSymptoms of anal abscess\nAnal abscess can be easily recognized through some of the following common symptoms:\nConstant sharp or dull pain in the anal area, possibly accompanied by swelling and severe pain when going to the toilet.; Constipation.; Abnormal rectal discharge or bleeding; Swelling or pain in the skin around the anus; Body fatigue, fever, chills; Feel the red, swollen and soft tumor on the anal rim.; Pain or discomfort in the abdomen (common in people with inflammatory bowel disease).; In infants, an abscess often appears as a red, soft swelling at the edge of the anus, causing the child to cry and become irritable because of discomfort, but there are no other unusual symptoms.\nAnal abscesses are easily confused with hemorrhoids because both cause pain and discomfort. However, the pain caused by this condition often occurs suddenly, quickly becoming more severe after only 1-2 days. Therefore, applying conventional treatment methods for hemorrhoids is completely ineffective. Additionally, abscesses also tend to be accompanied by symptoms of infection, including fever and chills at night.\n\nDiagnosis of anal abscess\nFor anal abscess, the doctor will initially ask a number of questions related to the level of pain, duration of symptoms... to help plan appropriate treatment. After that, a number of diagnostic methods may be prescribed, including:\nEndoscopy: Use an endoscope to look inside the anal canal and lower rectum (for cases where the abscess does not appear on the skin surface around the anus).; Blood tests.; Urine test.; Imaging diagnosis: X-ray, CT scan, MRI, ultrasound, in which MRI with magnetic contrast is the best diagnostic tool.\n\nComplications of anal abscess\nIf anal abscess is not diagnosed and treated promptly, it can lead to some serious complications as follows:\nAnal fistula: The disease appears with a small tunnel under the skin, connecting from the abscess to the infected gland, secreting a lot of pus and causing pain; Sepsis: This is a form of the body's response to infection, which can be life-threatening.; Fournier syndrome: This is a rare but potentially life-threatening infection.\nIs an anal abscess dangerous?\nAnal abscess can progress to many dangerous complications if not detected and treated promptly (sepsis, anal fistula...). In addition, this condition very rarely goes away on its own without needing medical intervention. Therefore, as soon as they notice signs of unusual pain, patients should proactively contact their doctor early for examination and diagnosis, to avoid repeated recurrences as well as serious complications.\n\nTreatment of anal abscess\nThe simplest and most common treatment for an anal abscess is to drain the pus from the infected area. Specifically, the doctor will use anesthetics, then perform suction to reduce pain, discomfort and heal tissues.\nIf the abscess is large, the patient may be prescribed surgery under anesthesia. After drainage, the wound will be left open and no stitches will be needed. In case the patient is diabetic or has a weakened immune system, the doctor may ask to stay in the hospital for a few days to monitor for infection (if any). Additionally, some post-drainage treatments include:\nUse antibiotics in cases where the patient has a weakened immune system or widespread infection.; Use laxatives or fiber supplements to avoid constipation.; Take a warm bath to reduce swelling; Regular follow-up examinations as prescribed by your doctor to monitor for recurrence.; Horseshoe-shaped anal abscess, on the levator muscle, extending through the obturator foramen, and Fournier's necrosis requires treatment by an experienced hospital and surgeon.\n\nHow to prevent anal abscess\nAnal abscesses cause pain, discomfort and can even lead to serious complications if not treated promptly. Therefore, applying preventative solutions right from the beginning is really necessary, including:\nActively control sexually transmitted diseases (use condoms when having sex, minimize anal sex...).(3); Keep the anal area clean; Treatment of diseases that are at risk of leading to anal abscesses such as Crohn's disease, constipation, ulcerative colitis...; Change diapers regularly to prevent anal abscesses in infants.\n\nfrequently asked Questions\n1. Does an anal abscess go away on its own?\nAnal abscesses rarely resolve on their own without medical treatment. Even if symptoms improve after home care, the patient still needs to contact a doctor for examination and diagnosis to avoid recurrence or dangerous complications.\n2. Does an anal abscess recur?\nAn anal abscess has the potential to recur or develop into a fistula even after medical treatment. Research shows that the recurrence rate tends to be proportional to body mass index (BMI). Therefore, even after treatment, patients should have regular follow-up examinations for accurate monitoring and examination.\nCenter for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City) and Department of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreatic (Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing High-end, effective examination and treatment services for patients with mild to severe liver problems (fatty liver, acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer...) and pathologies anus (anal abscess, anal inflammation, anal itching, anal fistula, anal cancer, etc.). Tam Anh General Hospital system brings together a team of highly specialized and experienced Internal Medicine - Surgery - Gastrointestinal Endoscopy doctors, in addition to the support of a modern medical equipment system imported from abroad. in addition, serving the maximum examination and treatment needs of customers.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of liver diseases with gastroenterology specialists of Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nAbove is a summary of all information related to anal abscess. Hopefully with these shares, patients will have more useful updates to proactively prevent, monitor, and detect early for effective treatment.",
