    "content": "Overactive bladder: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment\n\nStatistics in the US show that up to 30% of men and 40% of women in the US have overactive bladder. However, many patients do not know or are shy to share, causing their lives to be affected or face complications. Urology and Nephrology experts believe that currently there are many effective treatment and care methods for this condition so that patients can feel more comfortable.\n\nWhat is overactive bladder?\nOveractive bladder or overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition of untimely contractions of the bladder, causing the feeling of frequent, sudden and difficult to control urination. People with overactive bladder feel the need to urinate frequently day and night and may also experience urgency. Therefore, if you have a total number of urination more than 8 times a day or more than 2 times at night, you should think about overactive bladder. (first)\nOveractive bladder is not dangerous, but it can make the patient feel self-conscious, affect work and interfere with daily activities. Luckily, overactive bladder can be quickly diagnosed and treated effectively, giving the patient back their confidence.\n\nSymptoms of overactive bladder\nAccording to experts at the Center for Urology and Nephrology, Tam Anh General Hospital System, if the patient has an overactive bladder, the following symptoms may appear:\nFeeling a sudden urge to urinate and fear of urine leakage; Urgent urination as soon as you feel the urge to urinate; Frequent urination, more than 8 times in 24 hours; Waking up more than 2 times during the night to urinate\n\nCauses of overactive bladder\nThe causes of bladder disease are very diverse and have not yet been fully investigated. However, the main causes leading to this situation are:\n1. Involuntary bladder spasms\nOveractive bladder occurs because the bladder muscles contract involuntarily, even when the amount of urine in your bladder is low. These involuntary contractions create an urgent need to urinate in the patient. In addition, people with involuntary bladder spasms may have:\nNeurological disorders such as stroke, multiple sclerosis...; Diabetes; Urinary tract infections; Hormonal changes during menopause in women; Abnormalities in the bladder such as tumors or stones; Factors that impede bladder flow such as prostate enlargement, constipation, or patients who have undergone previous surgeries to treat urinary incontinence\n2. Other factors that may be associated with overactive bladder conditions:\nPeople taking diuretics or drugs that cause thirst and want to drink lots of water; People who consume too much caffeine or alcohol; People with cognitive function decline due to aging, causing signals from the brain to the bladder to become disturbed; People have difficulty walking, so when their bladder is full, they cannot get to the bathroom in time; People who often do not urinate cleanly can lead to symptoms of overactive bladder because there is less space to store urine\n3. Risk factors\nAge: Older people are more at risk of overactive bladder and urinary tract problems due to prostate enlargement, diabetes, etc.\nCognitive decline: People who have had a stroke or have Alzheimer's disease are also at increased risk of this condition. Because the brain loses the ability to control bladder management, water retention time and urination reminders...; People with multiple pregnancies: This group of people is susceptible to weakening of the pelvic floor muscles, leading to overactive bladder, urinary incontinence...\n\nComplications of overactive bladder\nAlthough urinary incontinence is not life-threatening, it greatly affects the patient's quality of life. Specifically, when not treated properly, patients face the following problems:\nFrequent infections of the urinary tract and appendages; Feeling self-conscious, insecure, even depressed; Sleep disorders and disrupted sleep cycles; Having many problems related to sex\n\nDiagnostic method\nAccording to Urology and Nephrology experts, to come up with a suitable treatment plan, doctors will take the following measures:\n1. Ask about medical history\nThe patient will be asked about the symptoms they experience, how long they last, and how much they affect their life. Medical history will include questions about the patient's past and present health problems.; At the same time, patients should also bring a list of non-prescription and prescription medications they are taking. The doctor may also ask the patient about eating habits, fluid intake during the day and night...\n2. Health examination\nTo find the cause of your symptoms, your doctor may also feel your abdomen and examine organs in the pelvis and rectum... using specialized instruments.; To assess the extent of abnormalities, the patient will be asked to keep a bladder diary for a few weeks to evaluate daily symptoms. Information includes: number of times to go to the toilet, time of urine leakage... to check: time and amount of fluid intake; number and duration of toilet visits; frequency of sense of urgency; time and extent of urine leakage...\n3. Other testing methods\nUrine test to look for signs of infection or blood; Cystogram to measure the amount of urine in the bladder after going to the toilet.; Other tests such as cystoscopy or urodynamics may also be ordered when the doctor needs a more in-depth examination.\n\nTreatment for overactive bladder\nDepending on the cause of overactive bladder, doctors will have different treatment methods, following the principle from simple to complex and can be individual or combined with multiple therapies at the same time.( 2) Specifically as follows:\n1. Change your lifestyle\nTo treat overactive bladder, doctors will first recommend that the patient make lifestyle changes. These changes can also be called behavioral therapy to bring about positive changes in health. Accordingly, doctors will advise patients to:\nLimit foods and drinks that impact the bladder: There are some foods and drinks known to irritate the bladder, causing excess urine such as coffee, tea, alcohol, soda and soft drinks. gas, some citrus fruits, tomatoes, dark chocolate, spicy foods... Patients should try eliminating some inappropriate foods from their diet to feel better. At the same time, add fiber such as oats, green vegetables... to your diet to improve digestion.; Keep a bladder diary: Writing down the number of times you go to the toilet in a day and doing it continuously for 1 week can help you understand your body better. This diary can also help patients make connections between foods and medications and worsening of symptoms.; Double emptying: This may be helpful for people who have difficulty emptying their bladder completely. To use this method, after going to the toilet, wait a few seconds and then try again to expel the urine.; Practice delaying urination: To treat with this behavioral therapy, the patient should practice waiting before going to the bathroom for about 1-2 minutes and then gradually increase it, to increase the bladder's ability to store water.; Urinate on time: Patients need to follow a daily toilet schedule, instead of going when they want, with the aim of preventing the feeling of urgency and regaining control of the bladder. To do this, patients need to discuss with doctors to arrange a reasonable schedule.; Practice exercises to relax and strengthen bladder muscles: Kegel exercises are a suitable choice, helping to tighten pelvic muscles to strengthen pelvic floor muscles.\nKegel exercises help strengthen the pelvic floor muscles\n2. Medical and surgical treatment\nPrescription medication: When lifestyle changes don't have the desired effect, the next step may be medication. Your doctor may prescribe muscle relaxants to help prevent your bladder from contracting when it's not full. Some medications are taken as oral medications, gels, or transdermal patches; Treatment is by injecting Botox into the bladder: Botox relaxes the muscles of the bladder wall to reduce urinary urgency and incontinence. To perform this procedure, the doctor will use local anesthesia and use a cystoscope inserted into the bladder to inject a small amount of botulinum into the bladder muscle. The effects of Botox last up to 6 months and treatment is repeated when signs of overactive bladder recur.; Nerve stimulation: This method is also known as neuromodulation. This treatment sends electrical impulses to nerves that share pathways to the bladder, allowing the bladder to function normally and improving overactive symptoms. There are two types of nerve stimulation: sacral nerve stimulation and tibial nerve stimulation. Each treatment course usually includes 12 sessions, depending on the disease condition; Surgery to expand the bladder with small intestine (ileum): For bladders with small volume, poor elasticity... causing bladder hyperactivity, greatly affecting life, the doctor will intervene with this method. However, the disadvantages of bowel bladder expansion surgery are quite large, so patients need to be carefully considered by the doctor and have it performed after other less invasive interventions have been unsuccessfully applied.\n\nPrevent overactive bladder\nA healthy lifestyle can help improve overall health in general and the urinary tract in particular. Therefore, overactive bladder can be prevented by building a healthy lifestyle:\nMaintain a reasonable weight; Physical activity and regular exercise; Limit the use of coffee, alcohol, etc.; No smoking; Strict control of chronic diseases; Do Kegel exercises to strengthen your pelvic muscles\nThe Center for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts in internal medicine and surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
