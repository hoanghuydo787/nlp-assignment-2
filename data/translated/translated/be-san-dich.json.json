    "content": "Postpartum dyshidrosis: Causes, signs, treatment and prevention\n\nAfter giving birth, women face many health risks that may be encountered during the postpartum period. One of those risks is the phenomenon of postpartum ectropion. So what is lochia blockage? How dangerous are complications? Pregnant mothers need to learn immediately to have timely prevention and treatment.\n\nPrevent postpartum fluid retention so that the mother can recover quickly and take good care of the baby. All women lose a significant amount of blood during and after giving birth. Because the amount of blood in the body has increased by about 50% during pregnancy, this blood loss is completely natural. However, for some reason, many women bleed very little along with some unpleasant symptoms. Medical science calls it the phenomenon of blockage of lochia. (first)\n\nWhat is ectopic pregnancy?\nObstructed lochia is a phenomenon in which fluid after cesarean section often cannot escape and stagnates in the uterus. Obstruction (obstruction) of lochia, if not detected and treated promptly, will lead to infection of lochia, blood clotting disorders, uncontrolled bleeding... extremely dangerous for the mother's life, according to the doctor. Dinh Thi Hien Le.\nWhether you have a vaginal birth or a cesarean section, you will still have vaginal discharge after giving birth. Lochia includes blood, remaining amniotic fluid, endometrial debris, and cervical secretions, all of which will flow out through the vagina. How long the process of vaginal discharge lasts depends on each person's body, on average 2 - 6 weeks. (3)\nSee more:\n5 most common postpartum diseases in postpartum women\n\nSigns of ectopic pregnancy\nDuring the first few days after giving birth, the body will expel a large amount of blood, bright red and similar to menstruation, accompanied by small blood clots. 10 days after birth, the lochia gradually dilutes, mainly containing white blood cells and cells from the uterine lining.\nIn the following days, the lochia will gradually decrease before completely disappearing after 2-4 weeks. In some cases, vaginal discharge continues for the next few weeks, up to 45 days after birth.\nThe above process takes place in pregnant women with normal vaginal discharge. But if you find yourself experiencing the following unusual symptoms, think about the phenomenon of obstetric and gynecological blockage:\nThe lochia flows very little and has a foul smell due to infection; Tightness in the lower abdomen, sometimes with dull pain; There is a hard lump in the abdomen, clearly felt when touched; Body temperature increases; Cervix is ​​closed, pain when pressing the bottom of the uterus\n\nCauses of dysplasia after birth\nSome of the following causes easily lead to the risk of detecting lochia obstruction after giving birth:\n1. Caesarean section\nCaesarean section causes women to lose more blood than normal birth. The uterus contracts poorly, so the fluid is difficult to push out and gets stuck in the uterus.\n2. Excessive blood loss during birth\nBlood loss is a normal phenomenon during childbirth, but if there is too much blood loss, the uterus will contract poorly, or even completely lose the ability to contract to push out the lochia. This is the common cause of postpartum lochia obstruction.\n3. Postpartum complications\nComplications that occur during and after birth such as large fetuses, multiple pregnancies, polyhydramnios, prolonged labor, etc. will easily cause pregnant women to have blocked lochia.\n4. Postpartum care is not good\nWomen with weak health after giving birth force them to lie in one place, have little movement, or have poor hygiene in their private areas leading to infection... contributing to increasing the risk of ectopic pregnancy after cesarean/vaginal birth.\nPregnant women with multiple pregnancies have an increased risk of postpartum fluid retention\n5. Objective reasons\nWhen the mother's uterine muscle tone is poor, the cervix is ​​closed, the mother's health is depleted... it will make the lochia unable to escape.\n\nIs ectopic pregnancy dangerous?\nThe disease can cause dangerous complications if not detected and treated promptly. These complications include blood infection, blood clotting disorders, uncontrolled bleeding, and in severe cases, hysterectomy may be required. Therefore, postpartum mothers need to pay close attention to their postpartum period. If you detect unusual signs, absolutely do not be subjective and go to the doctor immediately for proper treatment.\n\nHow to treat ectopic pregnancy for pregnant women?\nYou cannot self-treat postpartum obstetrics and need to go to the hospital to be examined by a doctor and prescribe appropriate intervention. Common methods that doctors often apply for treatment are:\n1. Dilation of the cervix\nThis is the first way to treat lochia. The doctor dilates the cervix by inserting specialized tools to remove all cells and stagnant fluid from the uterus. M.D. Dinh Thi Hien Le noted that this procedure should be performed at medical facilities that ensure clean hygienic conditions to avoid infection or complications later.\n2. Aspirate uterine fluid\nSimilar to cervical dilation, with the uterine fluid aspiration method, the doctor also uses a specialized tool (a suction tube) to suck out all the fluid. This straw needs to be absolutely sterile; Otherwise, pregnant women will face potential dangers that will affect their future reproductive health.\n3. Use drugs to stimulate uterine contractions\nThe main cause of lochia blockage is poor uterine contractions and inability to push lochia out. Therefore, for treatment, doctors can prescribe medication to help stimulate strong uterine contractions; thereby pushing all remaining substances out.\n\nHow to prevent ectopic pregnancy?\nTo prevent postpartum fluid stasis, mothers need to remember the following measures: (2)\n1. Clean the private area\nLochia is an ideal environment for bacteria and parasites to grow, causing vaginal and uterine infections. Therefore, women need to clean their private areas properly to avoid postpartum infections. Clean your vaginal area after each sanitary napkin change, preferably with warm water or diluted cleaning solution.\nIn addition, you should remember to use sanitary napkins specifically for pregnant women and change them regularly, 4-5 times a day. Do not use tampons, do not wipe the private area with chemical wet towels, do not douche, or take baths to avoid gynecological infections and increase the risk of disease.\n2. Walk and exercise lightly\nAfter giving birth, mothers should only lie down and rest for 6-8 hours, then get up and move gently. This helps the uterus contract and quickly expel the lochia, shortening the postpartum process.\n3. Breastfeed your baby early\nEarly breastfeeding is an indirect form of stimulating the uterus to contract to \"eliminate\" lochia. Therefore, you should follow some tips to stimulate milk production quickly (such as massaging the breasts, feeding the baby directly, using a breast pump...).\nMothers should breastfeed their babies as soon as possible to stimulate the uterus to contract and push the fluid out\n4. Reasonable diet\nPostpartum women should have their own diet to help increase milk supply and quickly eliminate lochia. There are many types of foods that should be on the menu for pregnant women such as Malabar spinach, amaranth, mugwort... They have the effect of enhancing milk supply and at the same time supporting the contraction process of the uterus, helping the lochia to be pushed out quickly. . In addition, fruits and vegetables such as luffa, green papaya, banana flower, turmeric... also have similar effects, stimulating milk glands, stabilizing the stomach and restoring the uterus.\n5. Frequent urination\nIn the first days after giving birth, your bladder may be less sensitive than usual. So you won't feel the need to urinate even when your bladder is quite full. In addition to causing urinary problems, a full bladder also makes it harder for the uterus to contract, making it harder for lochia to pass out. So, don't forget to go to the bathroom every 2-3 hours!\n\nSolutions to prevent and treat fluid obstruction after cesarean/vaginal birth at Tam Anh General Hospital\nTo detect early and effectively treat vaginal stasis for pregnant women as well as other obstetric complications, pregnant women need advice and support from experienced obstetricians.
