    "content": "Eczema: Signs, causes, complications and diagnosis\n\nEczema is a very common skin disease that causes itching, redness, dryness and irritation of the skin. This condition is also known as atopic dermatitis. The disease often begins in infancy or childhood and can last into adulthood. The disease can also happen to anyone and at any age.\n\nWhat is eczema?\nEczema is a group of conditions that make the skin inflamed or irritated. The most common type is atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema. “Allergy” includes groups of people who tend to suffer from allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergies, weather allergies, environmental allergies (house dust, pollen, etc.). (first)\nDyshidrotic eczema (a special type of atopic dermatitis) affects about 10% – 20% of children and about 3% of adults and children in the United States. Most children develop this condition before age 10. Some children continue to have these symptoms throughout their lives.\nAlthough there is no cure for eczema, through treatment and prevention of allergens, most symptoms of the disease can be controlled. Eczema is not contagious to others.\n\nTypes of eczema\nEczema is classified into many types with quite similar symptoms, including: Atopic dermatitis, coin eczema, secondary reactive eczema, hand eczema, bacterial eczema, dyshidrotic eczema, etc. The doctor can diagnose the disease. Depending on the type of rash and the location on the body to determine the type of eczema you have, including: (2)\nAtopic dermatitis\nThis is the most common condition of eczema and affects many adults. Atopic dermatitis is also associated with other allergic disorders, such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. The disease often begins in childhood.\nContact dermatitis\nMost people have this condition at some point in their lives. It occurs when the skin comes into contact with something that causes a rash. The substance may cause irritation or an allergic reaction. Trigger factors for each person will be different and are divided into 2 types of contact dermatitis:\nIrritant dermatitis, this is the common type and is more closely related to atopic dermatitis. Possible pathogens include skin care products, soaps, and detergents; jewelry made of nickel, industrial chemicals such as solvents and cement.; Atopic dermatitis flares up when the skin comes into contact with allergens that cause allergies such as nickel, metals, beauty products containing perfume, rubber, and preservatives.\nThe disc disease\nThis is a less common form of eczema but is difficult to treat. The disease causes an outbreak of tiny blisters on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, edges of the fingers, edges of the hands, etc. The cause can also come from sweating or contact with irritants such as needles. type.\nNeurodermatitis\nThis type of eczema tends to cause one or two patches of intense itching, often on the back of the neck, arms, or legs. Risk factors include having another form of eczema, such as atopic dermatitis or contact dermatitis, or simply having too dry skin. However, the disease is also associated with a number of mental health problems such as anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Women between 30 and 50 years old are more likely to get the disease than others.\nIndigo coins/coins\nIt is a common disease, characterized by blisters concentrated in round, oval clusters, and severe itching. The disease is related to impaired skin barrier function. Nummular eczema can occur at any age, is more common in men than women, and men >50 years old are associated with chronic alcoholism.\nThe cause of the disease is unclear. Some factors that trigger the disease include local injuries such as scratches, old surgical wounds, insect bites or thermal burns; Contact dermatitis may present clinically as penny eczema; Other skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, impetigo, wound infections, etc.\nClinically, coin eczema is divided into two types: wet type (vesicles, blisters, lots of fluid) and dry type (subacute or chronic, dry, scaly lesions).\nInfected eczema (bacterial eczema)\nThe cause of the disease comes from factors such as fungal, bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections. Superficial fungal infections, especially athlete's foot, are the most common cause.\nClinical manifestations of bacterial eczema are quite diverse: Diffuse or localized vesicles, maculopapular or scarlet rash, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme, centrifugal ring erythema, Sweet's syndrome, erythema nodosum. psoriatic lesions, diffuse red maculopapular pustular rashes, etc. The general mechanism is hypersensitivity reaction, however different clinical manifestations will have different corresponding types of hypersensitivity. The key to treatment is to eliminate the cause.\nHand eczema\nHand eczema is an inflammatory skin disease limited to the hands, common in adults with a rate of about 10%. The disease is classified according to disease progression:\nAcute or subacute hand eczema: Lasts less than 3 months or does not recur within 1 year.; Chronic hand eczema: Lasts more than 3 months or recurs more than twice in 1 year despite appropriate treatment.\nClinical manifestations and basic lesions of hand eczema can change over time, starting with red spots, edema and blisters. Later progresses to keratosis, fissures and other chronic changes.\nCommon forms of hand eczema include: Irritant contact dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, atopic hand eczema, vesicular hand eczema (leech hives), dermatitis and combinations. other (allergic and irritant contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis...).\nPeople whose hands come into contact with water or chemicals many times a day such as: Sanitation workers, car cleaners, kitchen assistants, food processors, nurses, surgeons, Painters, car repairmen, etc. are people at high risk of occupational hand eczema\nSeborrheic dermatitis\nThis condition occurs in areas of the body that have many oil glands. When it appears on the scalp, it is called dandruff. Seborrheic dermatitis can be the result of a severe reaction caused by high levels of the yeast Malassezia (a common organism found on the skin). Seborrheic dermatitis is also associated with other skin conditions, such as psoriasis, acne, rosacea and many others.\nStasis dermatitis or stasis dermatitis\nThe disease often occurs in people with poor blood circulation, often appearing in the lower legs. Unlike some other types of eczema, inflammation is not linked to genes. Some lifestyle habits can increase the risk of disease such as being overweight and lacking exercise. In addition, some occupations that require standing for long periods of time (teachers, security guards, etc.) or sitting for long periods of time (tailors, drivers, office workers, etc.) are also at high risk of getting this disease.\n\nEczema symptoms\nFor each person, the symptoms of eczema will be different. Outbreaks do not always occur in the same area. The characteristic symptom of eczema is itching, sometimes the itching appears before the rash. Other manifestations of eczema may also appear such as: Redness, dryness, cracking, thickening of the skin. Eczema can appear on any area of ​​the body.\nEczema often appears on the child's back, chest, etc\nSymptoms in newborns\nIn infants, an itchy rash can lead to a weeping, scaly appearance, primarily on the face, skin folds (intertriginous skin), and scalp. Symptoms can also appear on the child's arms, legs, back, and chest.\nSymptoms in young children\nChildren and adolescents who get the disease often have rashes in places such as the elbows, behind the knees, on the neck/wrists, and ankles. The rash turns scaly and dry. (3)\nSymptoms in adults\nThe rash often occurs on the face, back of the knees, wrists, hands or feet. The skin may appear very dry, thick or scaly. In fair-skinned people, these areas of skin may start out slightly red and then turn brown. In darker-skinned people, eczema can affect skin pigmentation, making the affected area lighter or darker.\n\nCauses of eczema\nThe exact cause of eczema is still unclear. Factors that can cause the disease include:\nImmune system response to allergens that cause allergies; Defects in the structure of the skin's protective barrier allow moisture to escape and germs to enter.; Family history of other allergies or asthma; Deficiency in filaggrin (a protein involved in the formation of the skin's protective barrier) can lead to drier, more itchy skin.\nAdditionally, some people experience outbreaks of itchy rashes as their body reacts to factors such as:\nClothes and bedsheets made of rough fabrics such as wool, polyester, etc.; Feeling too hot or too cold; Household products such as soap or detergent.; Animal hair.; Respiratory tract infection or cold.; Stress.; Sweat a lot.\n\nWhat complications can eczema cause?\nItching is the most severe symptom of atopic dermatitis, followed by redness and dry skin.\nSkin pain is a newly appreciated symptom of atopic dermatitis.\nSleep disorders occur in about 60% of children with atopic dermatitis, and parents of children with the condition are 4-8 times more likely to sleep an average of 6 hours less per night than parents caring for healthy children. strong. 15-30% of adults with atopic dermatitis experience sleep-related problems including: Insomnia, daytime sleepiness and fatigue, and sleep disorders are considered the most severe symptoms of inflammation. allergic skin.\nMore than 55% of adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis reported inadequate disease control. One in four adults with atopic dermatitis rates their health as “fair” or “poor”; More than 16% are “very” or “somewhat” dissatisfied with life. Negative ratings of health and life satisfaction increased with the severity of atopic dermatitis.\nHospitalizations due to flare-ups of atopic dermatitis and associated infections were associated with an 8.3-year reduction in life expectancy compared with the general population. In addition to hospitalization, the risk of death from any cause is slightly increased in people with this condition. Eczema has the highest impact on disability-related life years for patients with skin diseases worldwide.\n\nHow to diagnose eczema\nA dermatologist can diagnose the condition by examining the skin and taking a medical history. However, many people with eczema also have allergies. Therefore, your doctor may order some allergy tests to find the irritant or disease-causing allergen. Children with eczema are likely to have allergy testing done.\nIf your doctor diagnoses eczema, you can ask your doctor about what to do to prevent recurrence, including:\nWhat is the best way to add moisture to the skin? Can I use the product over the counter or do you need a prescription?; Do I need to buy soap, lotion and detergent for people with eczema? Are products that are fragrance-free or for sensitive skin helpful?; What foods should I avoid to avoid flare-ups?; Which fabrics should you avoid/should you wear?; Do pets make symptoms worse?; If sweating makes things worse, can I still exercise?; What happens if symptoms do not improve or a skin infection occurs due to scratching?; Does stress cause disease outbreaks?; How can we reduce the risk of disease outbreaks?\n\nHow to treat eczema\nIn treating eczema, the goal is to soothe and prevent itching, which can lead to infection. Accordingly, some things you can do to reduce symptoms include:\nDoctors often prescribe patients to use medications, creams, etc. to reduce disease symptoms\nAt home\nUsing moisturizing cream/ointment/wax soothes inflammation and maintains skin moisture, helping the skin heal quickly;; Hydrocortisone cream and antihistamines help reduce redness, itching, and swelling. You should only apply hydrocortisone to the affected areas of skin 4 times a day for 7 days. Keep away from eyes, rectum and genitals. Note, consult your doctor if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.; Apply wet gauze; Relax and practice meditation.\nDrug treatment\nYour doctor may also prescribe corticosteroid creams and ointments to reduce inflammation. If the area becomes infected, you will likely need antibiotics. Other options include chemical treatments that relieve itching, phototherapy (using ultraviolet light). When the disease becomes persistent and resistant to treatment, immunosuppressive drugs or biological drugs such as Azathioprine (Azasan), Methotrexate, Mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept), Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (Eucrisa ointment), Ruxolitinib (Opzelura cream) can be used. ), Upadacitinib (Rinvoq) or Cyclosporin… these drugs require monitoring.\n\nHow to prevent eczema from recurring\nSome tips that can help you prevent eczema flare-ups or keep them from getting worse:\nMoisturize your skin regularly.; Avoid sudden changes in temperature or humidity.; Maintaining cool air prevents the body from sweating or overheating to reduce itching.; Manage stress, take time to relax, and exercise regularly to help control stress and increase circulation.; Avoid wearing clothes made of scratchy materials such as wool, canvas, etc.; Do not use soap, detergents or strong solvents.; Pay attention and avoid foods that can cause symptoms.; Use a humidifier in the bedroom.\nIf your baby is more likely to have eczema due to family history, you should breastfeed your baby exclusively for the first 3 months of life or longer if possible. Doctors recommend that you continue to breastfeed your baby for at least 6 months (preferably 1 year) while you introduce your baby to solid foods. Babies also need to be protected from potential allergens such as pet dander, mites and mold.\n\nfrequently asked Questions\nIs eczema contagious?\nAre not. You cannot catch it from someone or pass it on to others if you have it. People with eczema do not mean their skin is infected or the disease can be transmitted from one person to another. Eczema tends to be hereditary but can also arise from a number of factors, including the immune system, environment and factors that cause the skin barrier to fall into a “faulty” state. However, eczema can lead to skin infections due to scratching when itchy or dry skin occurs. This condition can cause a breakdown of the skin barrier that protects against bacteria and other germs. (4)\nIs eczema dangerous?\nEczema is not life-threatening but affects the patient's quality of life, living, working and studying. In addition, a disease that lasts for many years can be a risk factor for other diseases to arise and worsen the condition. Include:\nAllergies: Children with eczema often develop other allergic conditions in a typical sequence such as food allergies, allergic rhinitis and asthma. Some of these conditions may persist for many years, others may resolve on their own with increasing age. People with atopic dermatitis are at increased risk of serious bacterial, viral and fungal skin infections.; Autoimmune disease and heart disease: Eczema in adults is linked to other serious chronic conditions including diabetes, obesity, autoimmune disease, high blood pressure and heart disease. The risk of these conditions increases with the severity of atopic dermatitis.; Infections: Adults hospitalized with eczema have significantly higher rates of serious infections including skin, respiratory and systemic (heart, brain, GI, bone) infections than those without the condition. this dermatological condition.; Eye problems: Adults with eczema are at risk for eye-related conditions including conjunctivitis, keratitis and keratosis; This risk increases with the severity of the disease.; Neuropsychology: Children with eczema are more likely to be diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Children and adolescents with eczema are 2 to 6 times more likely to have depression, anxiety or behavioral disorders than children without the condition. Adults with the disease are 2.5 – 3 times more likely to have anxiety or depression, increasing with the severity of the disease, but up to half of people may be undiagnosed. The negative impact of eczema on mental health is greater than for patients with heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure. Having eczema and childhood has a significant impact on the emotional and social well-being of parents and caregivers.\nImpact on lifestyle: Half of adults with moderate to severe eczema say the condition significantly impacts their lives. The disease also affects their studies, work, life and advancement. More than 85% of people with the disease said the disease affected their choice of clothes. Girls have more problems choosing clothes than boys. Eczema also affects their relationships and sexual health.; Economic & Social Impact: Adults with eczema, regardless of disease severity, are more likely to miss five or more days of work each year; facing the risk of quitting work. People with the disease use health care services and pay more for health problems caused by the disease. The annual economic burden of people with eczema, including direct medical costs, indirect costs due to lost productivity and impact on quality of life, is also higher.\nCan eczema be completely cured?\nEczema cannot be completely cured, but it can be controlled. Treatment is aimed at reducing itching, scaly patches, dry and cracked skin, etc.; more severe than superinfection and minimize acute relapses of the disease.\nAre people with eczema susceptible to skin infections?\nDuring outbreaks, when the lesions are not completely healed and recur many times, creating favorable conditions for bacteria and staphylococcus aureus to form and cause skin infections. Therefore, patients need to completely cure the disease in relapses to prevent other health risks.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with a Dermatologist at Tam Anh General Hospital System, you can choose from the following options:\nStatistics show that one in 10 people will develop eczema during their lifetime, with incidence peaking in childhood. People of all skin colors, races and ethnicities can be affected by eczema: White (11%), African American/Black (10%), Asian or Pacific Islander (13 %), Native Americans (13%). Therefore, people with eczema need to have a specific plan that includes regular medical examinations, staying away from allergens that cause allergies, etc. to prevent the disease from recurring, as well as an optimistic spirit to live \"peacefully\" together. with disease.",

In addition, a disease that lasts for many years can be a risk factor for other diseases to arise and worsen the condition. Include:\nAllergies: Children with eczema often develop other allergic conditions in a typical sequence such as food allergies, allergic rhinitis and asthma. Some of these conditions may persist for many years, others may resolve on their own with increasing age. People with atopic dermatitis are at increased risk of serious bacterial, viral and fungal skin infections.; Autoimmune disease and heart disease: Eczema in adults is linked to other serious chronic conditions including diabetes, obesity, autoimmune disease, high blood pressure and heart disease. The risk of these conditions increases with the severity of atopic dermatitis.; Infections: Adults hospitalized with eczema have significantly higher rates of serious infections including skin, respiratory and systemic (heart, brain, GI, bone) infections than those without the condition. this dermatological condition.; Eye problems: Adults with eczema are at risk for eye-related conditions including conjunctivitis, keratitis and keratosis; This risk increases with the severity of the disease.; Neuropsychology: Children with eczema are more likely to be diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Children and adolescents with eczema are 2 to 6 times more likely to have depression, anxiety or behavioral disorders than children without the condition. Adults with the disease are 2.5 – 3 times more likely to have anxiety or depression, increasing with the severity of the disease, but up to half of people may be undiagnosed.
