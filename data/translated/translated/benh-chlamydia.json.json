    "content": "Chlamydia: Causes, symptoms, treatment, prevention\n\nChlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection. The disease causes many serious complications, even infertility if not treated promptly. So what is Chlamydia? What are the causes, symptoms, treatment and prevention? Please refer to the article below.\n\nWhat is Chlamydia?\nChlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacteria chlamydia trachomatis. The disease tends to increase worldwide. The United States alone has nearly 3 million people infected with Chlamydia every year, most commonly between 14 and 24 years old. (first)\nChlamydia occurs in both men and women. Men can get Chlamydia in the urethra (inside the penis), rectum, or throat. Women with Chlamydia infection in the cervix, rectum, or throat. Chlamydia is not difficult to treat, however, if not detected and examined promptly, the disease can cause serious complications.\n\nHow is Chlamydia transmitted?\nUnsafe sex is the main cause of Chlamydia transmission. A person with Chlamydia can spread the disease to his or her sexual partner through anal, oral, or vaginal sex.\nThe more sexual partners, the higher the risk of infection. Besides, Chlamydia can be transmitted from mother to child through the placenta or by sharing sex toys with an infected person.\n\nSymptoms of Chlamydia infection\nMost people infected with early stage Chlamydia have no obvious signs or symptoms. Even when present, the signs and symptoms of the disease are often so mild that they are easy to ignore. Later, when symptoms gradually appeared, the disease progressed to the acute stage. (2)\n1. In men, Chlamydia has the following symptoms:\nPainful urination; Burning, itching spreads at the tip of the penis opening; There is a white, foul-smelling fluid secreting from the penis opening; In severe cases, there may be pain and swelling in one or both testicles; Semen disorders accompanied by blood.\n2. Chlamydia symptoms in women:\nAbnormal or odorous vaginal discharge; Severe itching in private area, burning pain when going to the toilet; Pain during sex; Abdominal pain accompanied by fever and nausea; Cervical infection.; Vaginal bleeding; Lower abdominal pain; Pain in the upper abdomen due to bacteria moving and spreading to the rectum.\n3. Other signs:\nChlamydia infecting the rectum (in men or women) will cause pain, discharge or bleeding.; Anus: discomfort and discharge.; Throat: usually asymptomatic; Eyes: red, painful and infected.\nChlamydia trachomatis bacteria causes Chlamydia disease.\n\nCause of Chlamydia\nChlamydia is caused by the bacteria chlamydia trachomatis. This is an intracellular bacterium with a very rapid growth and replication rate. Chlamydia has 3 different variations in clinical and biological manifestations: (3)\nChlamydia psittaci bacteria: commonly found in birds, infects humans causing parrot fever; Chlamydia pneumoniae bacteria: main cause of respiratory diseases; Chlamydia trachomatis bacteria: the main variant that causes sexually transmitted diseases or trachoma.\nChlamydia trachomatis is a special bacterium, an obligate parasite in living cells, spherical in shape, intermediate in size between bacteria and viruses due to its genetic system. Therefore, chlamydia trachomatis can be classified as a virus or bacteria. Chlamydia trachomatis is contained in secretions in the vagina, urethra, and cervix.\nChlamydia is spread from vaginal, oral and anal sex. Vaginal fluid or semen containing chlamydia trachomatis bacteria is transmitted from a sick person to a normal person. Pregnant women can transmit Chlamydia to their babies during birth.\nSome ways to transmit Chlamydia:\nRegular sex: bacteria are transmitted from the penis to the partner's vagina or vice versa.; Anal sex: bacteria are transmitted from the penis to the partner's anus or vice versa.; Oral sex: bacteria are transmitted from the mouth to the partner's penis, vagina, anus or vice versa; Sex with toys: bacteria transfer from the toy to a person's mouth, penis, vagina or anus.; Manual genital or anal stimulation: less commonly, infected vaginal fluid or semen can come into contact with the eyes causing infection (conjunctivitis).\n\nRisk factors increase the likelihood of infection\nFactors that increase the risk of Chlamydia infection:\nHaving sex under 25 years old; Having sex with multiple partners; Not using condoms or other safety measures when having sex; Have a history of Chlamydia infection or other sexually transmitted diseases; Gay sex.\nHow common is chlamydia?\nChlamydia is a common sexually transmitted infection. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in 2018 that there were about 4 million cases of Chlamydia infection recorded in the country. (4)\nAmong them, women have a higher incidence of the disease than men, most often occurring between 15 and 24 years old. 1 in 20 sexually active young women has Chlamydia. In addition, certain demographic characteristics such as age, gender and race may affect the risk of Chlamydia.\nChlamydia causes disease in men.\n\nIs Chlamydia dangerous?\nHave! Early stage chlamydia has no obvious signs or symptoms, so the disease is often overlooked. After being re-discovered and treated at a late stage, the disease now had complications.\nSome common complications:\nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID): occurs when bacteria spread to infect the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. PID can cause infertility, ectopic pregnancy or chronic pelvic pain.; Infection near the testicles (epididymitis): causes inflammation, fever, pain, and swelling of the scrotum; Prostate infection: affects the function and quality of the testicles, the sperm produced is not healthy for conception.; Infection in newborns: Chlamydia can be transmitted from the vaginal canal to the fetus. Babies are born at risk of pneumonia or serious eye infections.; Ectopic pregnancy: the fertilized egg implants and develops outside the uterus. Ectopic pregnancies need to be removed to prevent dangerous complications.\nSee details: Is Chlamydia dangerous? 6 serious complications\nWhat should you do when you detect Chlamydia infection?\nIt is necessary to distinguish Chlamydia from other sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea, Candida, etc. because the symptoms often have similarities and differences, making it difficult to diagnose accurately. Therefore, as soon as there are signs of suspected illness, you should quickly go to the hospital for timely consultation, examination and treatment.\nMethods of diagnosing Chlamydia\nWhen there are any suspicious symptoms, you should quickly go to reputable medical facilities for testing, early diagnosis and treatment to increase the chance of cure and minimize dangerous complications. Some tests used to diagnose Chlamydia include:\nNucleic acid amplification test (NAAT): the doctor will take a sample of fluid from the vagina, urethra or urine and send it for testing. This method can be performed with urine samples from both men and women.; Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test: detects Chlamydia antigen using monoclonal antibodies but the sensitivity is not high, reaching about 60% - 85% compared to culture. Specificity can reach 99%.; Enzyme immunoassay (EIA): helps find anti-Chlamydia antibodies in the patient's blood, and at the same time, activates the immune system. The sensitivity of this method reaches 60% - 80%, specificity 97% - 99%.; PCR (Polymerase), LCR (Ligase chain reaction) and TMA: techniques with the highest sensitivity and specificity. Specimens are taken from the cervix, urethra and urine. Specificity reaches 99%, sensitivity ranges from 70% - 100%.\n\nHow to treat Chlamydia\nChlamydia can be treated with antibiotics. However, do not stop taking the medicine after your symptoms improve. Instead, see a specialist for examination and treatment to avoid relapse.\nIn addition, during treatment, patients need to note the following:\nDo not have sex during the treatment period; Contact and notify your partner that you are infected. Because, they also need to be examined and treated for Chlamydia promptly.; Testing for other sexually transmitted diseases: HIV/AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea,...; In some cases, reinfection is possible, so about 3 months after treatment, the patient should see a doctor to check their health status.\nDo tests to detect Chlamydia.\n\nMeasures to prevent Chlamydia\nChlamydia can be cured, but that's not why you should be subjective about this disease. The best prevention is not to have vaginal, anal and oral sex. Do not use sex toys. If sexual intercourse arises, there are a few things to keep in mind:\nUsing condoms correctly is the most effective way to prevent disease, even when having anal, vaginal or oral sex.; Do not have promiscuous sex; Do not share sex toys. If so, clean and disinfect after each use and cover them with a condom.; Do not have sex during treatment; Proactively protect yourself by choosing a safe partner. At the same time, agree with your partner on the use of protective measures during sex.; Regular health checks and tests for yourself and your partner to promptly detect sexually transmitted infections, especially for people with a liberal lifestyle.; Sexually active women under 25 years of age should be screened for Chlamydia at least once a year.; Annual screening for older women with new or multiple partners; Chlamydia screening for pregnant women to limit the risk of transmitting the disease to children.\n\nQuestions related to Chlamydia fungal infection\n1. How long is the incubation period for Chlamydia?\n7 – 21 days. The incubation period of Chlamydia is calculated from the time the patient is exposed to the chlamydia trachomatis bacteria, until the symptoms appear clearly.\n2. Does chlamydia go away on its own?\nAre not! Chlamydia does not go away on its own. If not detected and treated early, the disease can seriously harm your health. At the same time, spreading Chlamydia to others puts them at risk of serious complications.\n3. Is it okay if chlamydia is left untreated?\nHave! Untreated chlamydia can be dangerous to your health. The disease causes many serious complications such as pelvic inflammation, prostate infection, ectopic pregnancy, and even infertility in men and women...\n4. How long does it take to cure chlamydia?\n1 or 2 weeks! Chlamydia will go away within 1 or 2 weeks. However, the disease can still return. Therefore, absolutely do not have sex during treatment to avoid reinfection.\nSpecialized in Dermatology - Skin Aesthetics, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, has high-end, specialized treatment services. With modern equipment, and a team of experienced doctors and medical staff, Tam Anh General Hospital always brings dedicated, quality, and effective health care services to patients.\nUseful information from the above article will help understand more about Chlamydia disease, causes, symptoms, treatment and prevention measures.
