Currently, the disease has appeared in 12 countries around the world such as England, Spain, Belgium, Italy, France, Germany, Portugal, Sweden, USA, Canada, Australia and is at risk of spreading to many other countries. What is monkeypox?\n, how serious it is, whether it spreads through the respiratory tract like the Covid-19 pandemic and the consequences of contracting it.\nmonkeypox\n What are the issues that many people are concerned about and worried about in recent days. The following article will summarize and provide the most basic information related to\nmonkeypox\n – a dangerous disease is breaking out.\n\nWhat is monkeypox?\nMonkeypox is a rare disease, caused by a virus related to the common smallpox. People with the disease often have symptoms such as rash, fever, headache, etc.\nMedical literature records cases of monkeypox transmitted directly through contact with infected people (contact with bedding, clothes, towels, secretions, respiratory droplets, etc.). Medical literature has not confirmed whether monkeypox is sexually transmitted or not. However, information from WHO records that the disease appears in some men who have sex with men. Children and adults are also susceptible to the disease.\nMost infected people recover within a few weeks, and the death rate is not high. However, risk factors leading to severe disease progression and high mortality include: infected people with long-term exposure to the virus, children, people with weak immune systems, etc.\nScientists say this disease is more difficult to spread than the Covid-19 epidemic. However, monkeypox can still become a global health threat if there is no timely vaccine.\n\nCause of monkeypox\nWhat is the virus that causes monkeypox? According to documents, this strain of virus belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus in the Poxviridae virus family, first discovered in 1958. Because the disease-causing virus was discovered in two outbreaks similar to smallpox that occurred in monkeys in the research laboratory. This disease is also called monkeypox. (first)\nHowever, up to now, monkeys are not the cause of this disease outbreak. According to WHO, it is likely that rodents are the largest source of infection, but it has not yet been determined exactly.\nMonkeypox is caused by a virus of the genus Orthopoxvirus\n\nSymptoms of monkeypox\nIncubation period\nIf a person is unlucky enough to contract monkeypox, how long is the incubation period for the disease and symptoms to appear? The answer is, usually after being infected with the virus that causes monkeypox, the incubation period can be from 5 to 21 days, meaning that after that time the first symptoms of the disease will begin to appear. In some cases, the incubation period lasts from 7 to 14 days. (2)\nSymptoms of monkeypox\nSymptoms that first appear when a person contracts monkeypox include:\nFever (usually the first symptom of illness); Severe headache; Back and muscle pain; Chills; Fatigue and lethargy; Lymphadenopathy\nAfter showing signs of fever, people with monkeypox may develop a rash 1 to 3 days later. The rash may appear on:\nAll over the face (95% of monkeypox patients have a rash on the face); Palms of hands and feet (the rash rate on palms and feet is also relatively high, up to about 75%); Mouth; Eyes (including cornea and conjunctiva); Genital\nWhat is monkeypox? Where do rashes on the body of people with monkeypox often appear?\nThe rash at first is only slightly rough on the surface of the skin and then becomes more serious, becoming blisters, swelling and gradually turning into pustules before drying, scabbing and collapsing. Normally, symptoms of monkeypox will last from 2 to 4 weeks and then go away on their own, the patient does not need to take special treatment measures.\n\nHow is monkeypox transmitted?\nMonkeypox can be transmitted directly through contact with blood, body fluids, respiratory droplets, wounds on the skin or mucous membranes of a sick person (or of an infected animal).\nIn addition, eating meat from infected animals, contact with sick person's items (bedding, towels, clothes, etc.) or contact with skin lesions of a sick person can also cause an infection. people infected with monkeypox. Therefore, if you live with someone who has monkeypox, the chance of infection is often quite high. (3)\nIn addition, this disease can also be transmitted from mother to fetus and lead to congenital monkeypox. Newborns who come into close contact with their mothers during and after birth are also at high risk of infection if their mothers are sick.\nAlthough close contact with sick people is considered a risk factor for spreading monkeypox, experts say it is still not possible to conclude whether this disease is sexually transmitted or not. More studies are needed to determine this issue.\nContact with a wound on the skin of an infected person can transmit monkeypox\n\nDiagnosis of monkeypox\nAlthough monkeypox outbreaks are on the rise, making many people worried about diagnosing the disease, in reality, not every case needs to be tested or screened for the disease. Screening for monkeypox should only be performed if:\nLiving or working with a person who has monkeypox or is suspected of having the disease.; Recently traveled to a country/area where monkeypox cases are occurring.; Bite or scratch from an infected/suspected monkeypox infected animal; Eating animals of unknown origin, at risk of infection; Living in tropical forest areas, there are animals infected with monkeypox.\nTo make a diagnosis of monkeypox, doctors will perform the following procedure: (4)\nFind out your medical history\nDoctors will ask you about your medical history to see if you have been in contact with an infected person, have ever had the disease, or have recently passed through areas where cases are occurring, etc. From there, the possibility will be determined. Infect your monkeypox.\nTest\nIn the next step, your doctor may instruct you to perform a PCR test on fluid samples or skin wounds, thereby detecting the virus that causes monkeypox in the body.\nBiopsy\nFinally, if infection is suspected, the doctor may ask the patient to perform a biopsy to accurately determine whether or not the infection is present.\nDuring the process of diagnosis and screening, blood tests are usually not performed. The reason is that the virus that causes monkeypox usually only stays in the blood for a short time, making it difficult to detect and accurately diagnose the condition.\n\nIs monkeypox dangerous? Is it fatal?\nAt this point, perhaps the answer to the question of what monkeypox is is somewhat clear. So is it dangerous for people with monkeypox and what complications can they encounter? According to documents, common complications of this disease are as follows:\nSepticemia; Inflammation of brain tissue; Bronchopneumonia; Corneal infection, loss of vision; The skin wounds become more serious, causing the skin to peel off in large patches.\nHistorically, the death rate from monkeypox has hovered around 11% of the number of people infected (children have a higher death rate). In recent times, the mortality rate has fluctuated between 3-6%.\nIt can be said that although monkeypox is more difficult to spread between people than Covid-19 and the symptoms of the disease are not too serious, this is still a dangerous disease, requiring preventive measures. Fit.\nPeople with monkeypox are at risk of blood infection leading to death\n\nTreatment of monkeypox\nUp to now, there is no specific treatment or medicine for monkeypox. However, patients should not worry too much because the disease can improve and go away on its own without treatment.\nSome drugs that are believed to be able to treat monkeypox include: The antiviral drug cidofovir, the new antiviral drug tecovirimat, the research drug brincidofovir (CMX001),... - These are inherently active drugs. against smallpox virus in monkeys. However, there are currently no drugs being researched or used in endemic areas to treat monkeypox.\nIn particular, patients who have been vaccinated against smallpox are still at risk of contracting monkeypox. However, the symptoms of the disease are often milder, do not progress seriously and have a low risk of complications, and do not require intervention.\n\nPrevention of monkeypox\nAlthough no cases of monkeypox have been recorded in Vietnam, disease prevention should still be emphasized. Some measures that can be applied to limit the risk of infection include: (5)\nAvoid contact with animals at risk of being infected with the virus that causes monkeypox (sick animals, dead animals in areas where monkeypox occurs, animals suspected of being infected,...).; Eat it cooked and drink it boiled. Only eat animals of clear origin and have passed inspection; Avoid contact with people at risk of illness. Do not touch items belonging to people at risk of infection; Isolate people with symptoms/at risk of infection; Frequently wash your hands with soap and water or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer, especially after recent contact with others.; Get vaccinated against smallpox. There is no vaccine to prevent monkeypox, but vaccination against smallpox can reduce the risk of contracting monkeypox by up to 85%.; Raise awareness of disease prevention. Regularly update disease information.\nFrequent hand washing helps reduce the risk of monkeypox\nTo schedule an examination, consultation and treatment at Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nPreviously, monkeypox only appeared in Africa, but recently, the disease has spread to other European countries. This causes many people to become worried about the disease situation. Medical experts also encourage people not to be subjective, to proactively vaccinate against smallpox and take appropriate preventive measures, and proactively seek medical examination if unusual symptoms are detected or exposure is suspected. with infected people/animals.",
