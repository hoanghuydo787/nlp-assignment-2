    "content": "Keratoconus: Causes, signs and treatments\n\nKeratoconus is a rare eye disease but can cause dangerous complications if not treated promptly. Furthermore, the causes and symptoms of the disease are also quite vague, causing patients to be examined in many places but still cannot \"catch\" the disease, only when examined at reputable eye specialists with a system of machines and doctors. With highly specialized doctors, new diseases can be discovered.\n\nWhat is keratoconus?\nKeratoconus is a condition in which the cornea protrudes, forming a pyramidal or cone-shaped cornea. This disease is explained by scientists as being caused by small protein fibers in the eye (collagen) that are responsible for holding the cornea in place. However, when these protein fibers weaken, they are no longer able to keep the cornea in shape and increasingly deform into a cone shape. (first)\nAnother reason mentioned is that the body no longer has enough antioxidants to protect the cornea. The cells then produce harmful substances, the same way a car releases exhaust fumes. Normally, antioxidants remove harmful substances and protect collagen fibers. However, when the level of oxidants decreases, low levels will cause collagen to weaken and the cornea to swell.\nI'm N.V.H. At the age of 14, her mother took her to an eye examination at Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City due to persistent blurred vision. She went to many doctors, had her glasses measured, had her glasses cut, and was diagnosed with amblyopia, but her condition tended to get worse.\nAfter examining and measuring the patient's glasses, M.D. Pham Huy Vu Tung, Ophthalmology Department, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, discovered that H. had symptoms of keratoconus.\nSo what is keratoconus? Normally, the structure of the eye's cornea is spherical, but in people with keratoconus, the cornea protrudes outward, forming a pyramidal shape.\nThe cornea protrudes outward, forming a cone (pyramid) shape.\n\nCauses of keratoconus\nThe cause of keratoconus has not yet been specifically determined. Ophthalmologists believe that genetics, environment, hormonal changes (after puberty)... are factors that more or less influence the cause of the disease.\nAccordingly, if a family member has had keratoconus, there is a high risk that the next generation may also have the disease. The disease can also occur more often in people with allergic diseases such as asthma, eczema...\nOther causes include:\nAge: The disease often begins in adolescence but can appear earlier in childhood or not until age 30. The disease can also occur in people 40 years of age and older, but is less common. ; Certain disorders: Studies have found a link between keratoconus and systemic diseases such as Down syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, osteogenesis defects, and retinitis pigmentosa .; Inflammation: Inflammation from allergies, asthma or allergic eye disease can break down corneal tissue.; Rubbing your eyes: Rubbing your eyes too much over time can damage the cornea, creating an opportunity for keratoconus to become more severe.; Race: A study of 16,000 people with keratoconus found that black or Latino people were about 50% more likely to have the disease than white people.\n\nSigns of keratoconus\nCorneal cone can cause characteristic symptoms such as blurred vision, constantly changing glasses, sensitivity to light... The disease usually affects both eyes and begins to appear from 10 years of age or older.\nKeratoconus can alter vision in two ways:\nWhen the cornea changes shape from a sphere to a cone, the smooth surface becomes wavy, known as irregular astigmatism.; As the front widens, myopia becomes more severe. You can only see objects clearly when they are close. Looking further away, you will feel everything is blurry and distorted.\nHowever, an ophthalmologist can detect these symptoms during an eye exam. In addition, you should also pay attention to symptoms such as:\nDouble vision condition (diplopia), seeing 1 object as 2 when looking with one or both eyes; Blurred vision of near and far objects; Feeling of a halo around a light bulb that is on; Light; Blurred vision makes it difficult to control the vehicle\n\nSymptoms\n\"In H.'s case, if we only rely on the diagnosis of amblyopia and apply treatment measures in that direction, in the long term the disease will progress seriously, even facing the risk of complete loss of vision,\" said Dr. Doctor Tung commented.\nTherefore, patients need further monitoring and, if necessary, corneal mapping and hard contact lenses should be adjusted accordingly. In more severe cases, a corneal transplant is needed to correct the patient's blurred vision.\nOther complications of keratoconus include: sudden loss of vision, corneal scarring due to rapid bulging of the cornea, blindness...\n\nDiagnostic method\nTo diagnose the disease, your doctor will measure the shape of your cornea. There are many different ways, but the most common is called corneal topography. The doctor takes pictures of your cornea and examines it carefully. (2)\nMeasuring corneal topography is one of the methods to diagnose keratoconus\nSome factors for the diagnostician to consider include: whether the patient has astigmatism, whether the cornea has an elongated shape like a rugby ball or a spherical shape like a basketball; Does the patient have nearsightedness; The patient has symptoms of nearsightedness and astigmatism; corneal mapping, corneal topography; Check the cornea with a biological microscope to check for wrinkles in the cornea...\nIf your family has parents with keratoconus, your child should be screened for this disease every year, starting at age 10.\n\nTreatments\nIn mild cases, the doctor may recommend that the patient replace new glasses to overcome blurred vision, or wear hard contact lenses with good gas permeability. However, over time, the person may need other treatments to strengthen the cornea and improve vision. (3)\nUsing hard contact lenses with good gas permeability helps improve blurred vision in people with keratoconus\nAnother treatment called corneal collagen cross-linking may stop the disease from progressing. Or apply the intracorneal ring segmentation (INTACS) method under the corneal surface to flatten the cone and improve vision.\nWhen all treatments fail to improve vision, the last resort will be a corneal transplant. This is a safe surgery and has a high success rate. The doctor will do this by replacing the center of the cornea with a cornea from a donor and sewing the new cornea into place. You may need to use contact lenses afterward.\nDr. Tung recommends that although eye disease progresses slowly, the serious consequence is permanent vision loss. Therefore, when detecting unusual signs of the eye, it is necessary to go to a reputable eye specialist to be examined, detected and treated promptly.",
