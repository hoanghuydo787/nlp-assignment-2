    "content": "Gnathostomiasis: Causes, symptoms, treatment and prevention\n\nPeople get gnathostomiasis by eating food containing the parasite Gnathostoma spp. (such as freshwater fish, eels, frogs, frogs, reptiles, snails, shrimp, crabs...) but undercooked or eaten raw, eaten undercooked, made into salad... Although gnathostomiasis can be cured, it occurs in 8% of cases. – 25% of cases leave lasting sequelae or death. So what is gnathostomiasis?\n\nWhat is gnathostomiasis?\nGnathostoma disease is an infectious disease caused by roundworms with spikes on their heads, scientific name Gnathostoma spp. cause. The world recognizes at least 5 species of gnathostoma that cause disease in humans, including Gnathostoma spinigerum, Gnathostoma hispidum, Gnathostoma doloresi, Gnathostoma nipponicum and Gnathostoma binucleatum. Particularly in Vietnam, Gnathostoma spinigerum is the main pathogenic species\nThe first person in the world recorded to be infected with gnathostomiasis was a woman in Thailand. Specifically, in 1889, Dr. Deutzer discovered that this patient was infected with the Gnathostoma parasite.\n\nCause of gnathostomiasis\nNowadays, many people increasingly like to collect \"unique\" dishes such as raw fish salad, rare meat, undercooked meat, even eating raw with mustard, dipping foods in vinegar such as shrimp, prawns, freshwater fish, etc. Eels, crabs, birds, reptiles... If unfortunately, eating raw or undercooked food containing gnathostome larvae, the patient will be at very high risk of infection.\nAlthough the disease can be cured, statistics show that from 8% - 25% of cases leave lasting sequelae or death.\n\nSymptoms of gnathostomiasis\nFirst stage (lasting from weeks 2 - 3): Gnathostome larvae attack the body, they will pass through the stomach, intestines, and liver, so the patient does not have clear symptoms. In some cases, patients show signs of fever, excessive fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea.; Migration phase (lasting from weeks 3 - 4): Symptoms of this stage are related to the location of the parasite moving under the skin, usually starting within 3 - 4 weeks after infection. Patients may experience swelling under the skin that may be accompanied by pain, redness or itching. If you press on the bump with your finger, it won't leave an indentation.\nParasites Gnathostoma spp. can penetrate organs such as eyes, ears, lungs, bladder, brain... If they move into the eyes, it can easily lead to impaired vision and blindness; nerves and spine causing nerve pain and muscle paralysis; into the brain causing headaches, decreased consciousness, coma, and death. Note, patients with parasites moving under the skin in the facial area will be at greater risk of attacks on the brain and eyes.\n\nAre gnathostomes contagious?\nGnathostomiasis is not transmitted from person to person. The life cycle of parasitic gnathostomiasis mainly occurs in dogs, pigs, cats, and wild animals (called hosts), while humans are infected by accidentally eating larvae found in food or water sources containing the disease. . In addition, in some rarer cases, people have gnarled head worms burrowing through the skin.\n\nTransmission route of gnathostomiasis\nAdult gnathostome worms are 11-54 mm long, females (25 - 54mm) are longer than males (11 - 25 mm). Female worms have a round back, a slightly flat abdomen and 2 large fleshy spines around the head. Male worms have smaller and blunter spines, and 8 papillae on the tail surrounding the anus.; The body of an adult gnathostome worm is cylindrical, with a bulbous head, covered with rows of sharp spines. The worm's head is divided into 4 sacs, 4 hollow chambers, each chamber continuous with a sac in the neck through the central chamber.; Adult worms live in the stomach wall of certain animals (pigs, dogs, cats and wild animals - this group of animals is called the host). Gnathostome worms do not have a digestive system, so they use their bodies to absorb nutrients from the host.; Male and female worms mate and lay eggs. Worm eggs are excreted in the stool. Gnathostome eggs are thin, oval shaped, 40-70 micrometers in size. Inside the egg contains 1-2 embryo cells; When released into the outside environment, if gnathostome eggs encounter a water environment, after only 1 week, the eggs develop into embryos, releasing stage 1 larvae. Larvae of Gnathostoma spp are 3-5mm long. , with a diameter of about 0.3mm. When eaten by small molluscs (such as shrimp, prawns, crabs... called first intermediate hosts), they develop into stage 2 larvae; When freshwater fish, eels, frogs, frogs, and snails (the second intermediate host) eat the molluscs, the 2nd stage larvae develop into 3rd stage larvae. If pigs, cats, dogs or Wild animals eat frogs, frogs, freshwater fish, snails, snakes... then after 4 weeks, the larvae develop into adult gnathostomes.; Worms lay eggs in the stomach, the eggs will fall into the stomach and be passed out in the stool. A new life cycle of gnathostome worms appears again.\nIn humans, if you eat food (freshwater fish, snails, frogs, frogs, snakes, eels, shrimp, crabs...) that are uncooked, raw, salad... or drink water containing gnathostome larvae, you will infection. A few people are infected with gnathostomiasis because the larvae burrow through the skin. Gnathostome larvae can survive in the human body for 10 - 12 years.\n\nClassification of gnathostomiasis\nLarvae of Gnathostoma spp. capable of moving randomly throughout the human body. Depending on the location of the larvae, gnathostomiasis is divided into two main types: cutaneous gnathostomiasis and visceral gnathostomiasis.\nGnathostomiasis in the skin: the skin on the hands or feet, arms, shoulders, face, feet, trunk, even the skin around the eyes... local swelling of different sizes, inflammation, redness, pain , itchy. Depending on the depth under the skin, the swelling can last from 1 week to several months.; Visceral gnathostomiasis: the patient may cough frequently, cough up blood, have chest pain, difficulty breathing and pneumothorax (due to larvae attacking the respiratory system); epigastric pain, nausea or vomiting (stomach); blood in urine, may irritate the kidneys (urinary); paralysis, convulsions or coma (central nervous system)…\nPatients may have both skin symptoms combined with internal symptoms, such as skin, eyes, nerves... along with fever. Depending on the movement of the worms, each person's symptoms may be different. Symptoms of the disease can change from 24–48 hours, even up to 1-2 years later.\n\nComplications of gnathostomiasis can occur\nGnathostome larvae can cause many different complications, depending on the path of the larvae and the shallow or deep level of skin and internal organs attacked by the larvae. For example, gnathostomies, when moving to the eye, can \"attack\" the optic nerve, causing retinal scarring, peeling, vision loss, blindness, uveitis, iritis, and intraocular pressure. and hemorrhage…\nMost feared, the disease attacks the spine and brain, causing spinal myelitis, encephalomyelitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage... easily causing paralysis, coma, and death.\n\nHow is gnathostomiasis diagnosed?\nMedical examination: the doctor checks to see if the patient's swollen skin area moves or not. Ask whether the patient has ever eaten undercooked freshwater fish, eels, frogs, birds or reptiles or lived in an area with parasites; Blood test: find the number of eosinophils using the Elisa technique, to identify parasitic diseases; Imaging diagnosis: X-rays of the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, CT contribute to recording intracranial bleeding, meningitis...; In addition, the doctor may also ask the patient to have a sputum smear, histology test to find worm larvae, and cerebrospinal fluid puncture for diagnosis.\n\nHow to treat gnathostomiasis\nCurrently, treatment of gnathostomiasis is quite convenient. Effective treatment drugs are albendazole and ivermectin. In addition, depending on the sequelae of gnathostomiasis, doctors have different treatment options for each patient. Therefore, if suspected of being infected with gnathostome parasites, the patient needs to see a doctor for the most appropriate treatment.\n\nFactors that increase the risk of disease\nPeople living in environments with endemic gnathostomiasis; People traveling to places with sources of disease, eating and drinking uncooked dishes such as: salad, raw freshwater fish, eels, frogs, frogs, reptiles...; People who work frequently in contact with fresh food contaminated with gnathostome larvae; People who process freshwater fish, frogs, frogs, eels... but do not wear protective gloves...\n\nPreventive measures for gnathostomiasis\nWhen processing fresh food, especially from animals, you need to wear gloves.; Do not eat raw, undercooked, raw, or undercooked freshwater fish, eels, frogs, frogs, birds, or reptiles; Fish, eel, frog... foods need to be cooked at temperatures above 63 degrees Celsius; Wash hands with soap and warm water before and after preparing food.; Do not keep raw food sources close to cooked foods.\nTam Anh General Hospital Testing Center meets ISO 15189:2012 standards, continuously investing in the latest generation machinery with leading technology from European and American countries such as: 3 Tesla MRI machine, CT scanner. 768-slice class, modern 4D echocardiography machine, LOGIQ Fortis ultrasound machine, machines and biological products for testing parasites of gnathostomiasis, roundworms, strongyloides, liver flukes...\nIn particular, the Testing Center, Medical Examination Department... have leading experts in the field of parasites, helping patients not only get accurate test results early but also ensure highly effective treatment.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Testing Center, Medical Examination Department, you can make an appointment online through the following ways:\nCall the hotline 0287 102 6789 - 093 180 6858 (HCMC) or 024 3872 3872 - 024 7106 6858 (Hanoi) to register for a private medical appointment with a specialist, through the customer service staff.; Register for a medical appointment with any doctor you trust at the link: https://tamanhhospital.vn/danh-cho-khach-hang/dat-lich-kham/; Send a message on Tam Anh General Hospital Fanpage or Tam Anh General Hospital Urology and Andrology Fanpage; Text message via Zalo OA of Tam Anh General Hospital.\nGnathostoma disease is a disease caused by the parasite Gnathostoma spp. Caused by eating raw, undercooked meat, especially salads, rare dishes from freshwater fish, shrimp, prawns, crabs, snails, eels, frogs, frogs... containing worm larvae. Therefore, in addition to preventing eating food and using cooked and sterilized water, patients need to see a doctor if they suspect they have gnathostomiasis.",
