    "content": "Ascariasis: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis, prevention\n\nRoundworm disease occurs mainly in children under 10 years old, especially in areas with hot and humid climates, poor sanitary conditions, and using fresh manure to fertilize plants. Patients are susceptible to malnutrition, abdominal pain, nausea, intestinal obstruction... What is roundworm disease, causes, symptoms, diagnosis and how to prevent roundworm for the safest prevention?\n\nWhat are roundworms?\nAscaris lumbricoides roundworm is an intestinal parasite that causes the most common disease among human parasites. People get sick by consuming food and water sources containing roundworm eggs, especially in areas without modern toilets. Sick people often have no symptoms, but when the intestines contain many roundworms, they can experience problems in the lungs, intestines... (1)\n\nWhat is roundworm disease?\nAscariasis is an infection of parasitic worms in the human body from the larval stage to adulthood. Adult worms can be more than 30cm long. Roundworm disease is common in children in tropical regions, with humid climates, poor hygiene, lack of toilets... Although the disease is common globally, people with mild disease often have no symptoms, while people with severe disease have serious complications may occur. (2)\n\nSymptoms of roundworm disease\nUsually, patients have no symptoms or mild, vague symptoms if they only have a mild infection. But in some cases, severe infections, roundworm parasites attack the lungs and intestines, which is very dangerous.\nIn the lungs: ingested eggs reach the small intestine and release larvae. The larvae migrate through the bloodstream or lymphatic system into the lungs. Therefore, patients may experience signs and symptoms similar to asthma or pneumonia such as: persistent cough, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, wheezing...; fatigue, weight loss, abdominal pain, stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea, bloody stools, worms in stools, intestinal obstruction, malnutrition.\n\nWhat are the stages of development of roundworm disease?\nInvasion stage: people accidentally swallow worm eggs into their stomachs by eating raw vegetables or fruits grown on soil containing the disease source or their hands are contaminated with worm eggs when playing on the ground or in the garden but do not wash with soap when eating. drink…; Migration stage: eggs, when swallowed, will hatch into larvae in the small intestine. Following the bloodstream and lymphatic system, the larvae pass through the intestinal wall and move to the heart and lungs. After 10-14 days of development in the lungs, the larvae continue to sneak up the airways and attack the throat. At this time, the patient feels uncomfortable so he coughs continuously and swallows the eggs back into his intestines.; Adult stage: the larvae return to the intestine and develop into male or female roundworms. Female worms can be longer than 40cm, male worms are smaller; Reproductive stage: every day, female worms can lay 200,000 eggs. Fertilized eggs from male and female worms will be released into the outside environment in the feces. The entire process from the moment a human swallows an egg until it reaches adulthood can last from 2-3 months. Roundworms can live in the human body for 1-2 years.\n\nCause of roundworm disease\nPeople with ascariasis suffer from swallowing roundworm eggs that stick to food and drinking water, especially raw vegetables that are fertilized with fresh fertilizer but are not washed under running water. (3)\nIn addition, many people, especially children, when playing in soil, fields or gardens with roundworm eggs, put their hands in their mouths. Ascaris eggs can survive in soil for several years, while each female worm can lay up to 200,000 eggs per day.\n\nTransmission routes of roundworm\nEating food: people accidentally eat roundworm eggs from unwashed food, especially raw vegetables fertilized with human feces. (4); Drinking dirty water: in areas with disease sources, eggs can easily float out into ponds, lakes, etc. If this water is watered on vegetables, tubers, and fruits that people eat without washing or drink uncooked water, it is also a problem. will get sick.; Putting hands in mouth: children, when playing on contaminated soil containing pathogens, put their hands in their mouths.\n\nAre roundworms contagious?\nAre not! Roundworm disease is not transmitted directly from person to person. An estimated 807 million – 1.2 billion people around the world are infected with Ascaris lumbricoides (sometimes just called roundworm or ringworm). People are infected with roundworms by contact with soil mixed with human or animal feces containing roundworm eggs or contaminated water or food sources.\n\nSubjects at risk of developing ascariasis\nAge: children under 10 years old are susceptible to roundworm disease because they are more active and dirty; Climate: in hot and humid tropical climates, worm eggs are favorable for development; Poor hygiene: in rural areas in developing countries, public toilets are often used, non-modern toilets... so pathogens can easily spread.; Living habits: some farmers use human feces as fertilizer, causing the disease to spread more; Eat fresh food: People who have the habit of eating food that is not thoroughly washed, raw meat... are also at risk of infection.\n\nComplications of ascariasis\nAdult roundworms moving abnormally in the body will cause damage to the organs they pass through such as: appendicitis, acute pancreatitis due to the worms entering the Wirsung duct, entering the common bile duct causing bile obstruction, inflammation of the gallbladder. bile, creating gallstones, and worms crawling into the liver, causing liver abscesses.\nRoundworms also cause intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, peritonitis, and secrete toxins that cause convulsions, epilepsy, meningitis, etc.\n\nMethods of diagnosing roundworm disease\nClinical diagnosis: Symptoms of digestive disorders caused by roundworms are not unique characteristics of roundworm disease, such as pulmonary manifestations or clinical manifestations of complications due to ectopic worms. causes, can also appear in other diseases. Therefore, diagnosing roundworms by examination is usually not decisive for diagnosis; Diagnostic testing: Testing can detect patients infected with roundworms, making diagnosis and treatment easier. Patients are tested for roundworm eggs in stool using the technique of smearing stool on glass slides and observing under a microscope. Concentration techniques can be used to have a higher density of roundworm eggs, helping to minimize cases of worm spawning. less eggs. Because female worms have a period of not giving birth, in some cases it is necessary to test again after 2-3 days and test continuously for 3 days to reach an accurate conclusion. In some rare cases, patients are infected with male worms so no eggs are seen in the stool.\nDuring the larval stage, if the patient is newly infected with roundworms for the first time or has previously been cleared of worms, stool tests will not find worm eggs. Instead, the patient can have an abdominal X-ray with contrast dye given. The worms absorb the contrast material, which will produce images of the worms on film.\nCurrently, with the development of testing techniques, it is possible to determine roundworm infection using immunological techniques with IgM and IgG antibodies.\n\nTreatment methods for roundworm disease\nCurrently, drugs to treat roundworms are highly effective and more convenient for patients, do not require fasting, do not depend on time, the drug is usually taken in a single dose, the amount of drug is small...\nMebendazole 100mg x 2 times/3 days or 500mg single dose; Albendazole 400mg single dose once a day; Pamoate Pyrentel\n\nMeasures to prevent roundworm disease\nTo effectively prevent and treat roundworms, it is necessary to interrupt the development cycle of roundworms by combining many measures together; Hygiene and wash hands thoroughly before and after eating; Drink boiled water, wash fruits and vegetables under clean running water.; Instruct children not to put their hands in their mouths and to wash their hands thoroughly when playing; Educate people not to defecate in the open; Do not use fresh fertilizer to fertilize vegetables or plants; Do not let pets roam freely.; Increase construction of toilets in rural areas and public toilets in urban areas.\nTam Anh General Hospital Testing Center in Ho Chi Minh City meets ISO 15189:2012 standards, and is synchronously invested in modern machinery with advanced technology from European and American countries. Thanks to that, the Testing Center returns results early, ensuring accuracy, helping doctors make timely diagnoses and provide effective treatment.\nCall the hotline 0287 102 6789 - 093 180 6858 (HCMC) or 024 3872 3872 - 024 7106 6858 (Hanoi) to register for a private medical appointment with a specialist, through the customer service staff.; Register for a medical appointment with any doctor you trust at the link: https://tamanhhospital.vn/danh-cho-khach-hang/dat-lich-kham/; Send a message on Tam Anh General Hospital Fanpage or Tam Anh General Hospital Urology and Andrology Fanpage; Text message via Zalo OA of Tam Anh General Hospital.\nAscaris lumbricoides roundworm is a common parasite worldwide but is most common in developing countries, hot and humid climates, and poor sanitary conditions.
