    "content": "What is strongyloidiasis? Causes, symptoms and treatment\n\nStrongyloides are dangerous parasites in the digestive tract. This type of parasite can survive for a long time in the human body, causing many dangerous complications. Early detection of worm infection and timely treatment will help reduce the risk of serious complications.\n\nWhat is strongyloidiasis?\nStrongyloides stercoralis was first discovered in the South, Vietnam in 1876. The true frequency of the disease is difficult to determine because the majority are often latent infections (2- 20%). Presentation can vary from asymptomatic to multiple organ failure. The mortality rate of patients infected with strongyloides admitted to 3 hospitals is 16.7%. In immunocompromised people, it can cause disseminated strongyloidiasis and death.\nThe disease has two forms: parasitic strongyloides and free-living strongyloides in the environment outside the host's body. The larvae penetrate through the skin into the lymphatic and venous systems and into the circulation to the lungs, trachea, esophagus, stomach and the first part of the small intestine located there. When larvae reach the lungs, they may not enter the alveoli but circulate in the blood and reach other organs. During migration, the larvae must undergo two molts to mature.\nAdult worms usually live in the duodenum and jejunum. Severe cases of infection can occur in the stomach, pylorus, colon, biliary tract... Each adult worm can live up to 5 years and continue the reproductive cycle. Worm eggs appear 28 days after infection. Strongyloides are the only parasite where larvae are found in feces (not eggs). Strongyloides eggs are only found when there is massive diarrhea in cases of severe illness, the eggs do not have time to hatch and the larvae in the intestines are passed out in the stool. Under favorable climatic conditions, the larvae can develop into strongyloides that freely live in the outdoors.\nIn some cases, such as long-term constipation, reduced intestinal motility, diverticulosis, larvae that are not excreted in the stool can pass through the intestinal wall into the circulatory system and continue the parasitic cycle as above. The central nervous system, liver, and lungs are common sites of this autoinfectious cycle. This auto-infection cycle, especially in immunocompromised people, is the cause of prolonged reinfection even after leaving the endemic area, which can last up to 36 years.(2)\n\nSymptoms of strongyloides infection\n1. Clinical\nMost strongyloides infections are often asymptomatic and can persist for decades without diagnosis. Symptoms may manifest through the skin, gastrointestinal tract or respiratory tract.; Most strongyloides infections are often asymptomatic and can persist for decades without diagnosis. Symptoms can manifest through the skin, gastrointestinal tract or respiratory tract.\nThrough the skin: Larvae usually penetrate the legs or any location in contact with infected soil, often causing local dermatitis reactions such as itching and zigzag hives that can change location to suit the allergic reaction. reaction as the larvae migrate, sometimes as a hemorrhagic nodule secondary to ruptured blood vessels. This symptom can last for several hours, all day and recur every month or year.(1); Through the skin: Larvae usually penetrate the legs or any location in contact with infected soil, often causing local dermatitis reactions such as itching and zigzag hives that can change location to suit the allergic reaction. reaction as the larvae migrate, sometimes as a hemorrhagic nodule secondary to ruptured blood vessels. This symptom can last for several hours, all day and recur every month or year.

Strongyloides infection is the cause of anorexia, slow growth, and malnutrition in children.\nRespiratory tract: In mild cases, there will be wheezing and sneezing. When superinfected or superimposed on other diseases, it often causes coughing, wheezing, difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, and in severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults (ARDS). must be mechanically ventilated.; Respiratory tract: In mild cases, there will be wheezing and sneezing. When superinfected or superimposed on other diseases, it often causes coughing, wheezing, difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, and in severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults (ARDS). mechanical ventilation is required.\nHyperinfection syndrome: Often occurs in people with exhaustion, immunodeficiency, malignant disease, diabetes, alcoholism. Gr - intestinal bacteria can attach to larvae and move throughout the body, causing blood infections, meningitis, and prolonged fever.; Hyperinfection syndrome: Often occurs in people with exhaustion, immunodeficiency, malignant disease, diabetes, alcoholism.

Using the Baermann technique to increase sensitivity: Fecal samples to find larvae are incubated in warm water and then centrifuged with liquid agar to detect.; Stool examination: Worm larvae or eggs may be found (when there is massive diarrhea).; Using the Baermann technique to increase sensitivity: Fecal samples to find larvae are incubated in warm water and then centrifuged with liquid agar to detect.; Aspirate duodenal fluid to look for strongyloides larvae; Eosinophil elevation to monitor disease progression and assess the possibility of reinfection.; ELISA tests are highly sensitive and specific, but reliability depends on the laboratory. Antibodies persist many years after successful treatment and can also be (-) pseudo in immunocompromised patients.; Imaging diagnosis: Lung lesions can be infiltrated, nodular, pneumonia or pulmonary edema.\n\nTreatment of strongyloidiasis\nWhen there are suspected symptoms, patients need advice and treatment from an experienced gastroenterologist.\nThe drug of choice is Ivermectin due to its high effectiveness and few side effects. Thiabendazole is highly effective but has poor tolerability. Albendazole is an alternative drug.(3)\nCenter for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City) and Department of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreatic (Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing High-class, effective examination and treatment services for patients with mild to severe liver problems (fatty liver, acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer...).
