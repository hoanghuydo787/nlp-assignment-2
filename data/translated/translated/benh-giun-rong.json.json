    "content": "Dragon worm disease: Causes, signs, treatment measures\n\nVietnam has recorded at least 4 cases of dragon worm disease, including the habit of eating fish salad, drinking stream water... Patients will often have symptoms such as very painful dermatitis, abscesses may appear at the site of the worms. death, debilitating arthritis, ankle and knee joint infections are common complications, causing joint deformities. So what are dragon worms? Dangerous disease? Causes and treatments? Please follow the article below to see detailed information about this disease.\n\nWhat are dragon worms?\nDragon worms or Guinea worms have the scientific name Dracunculus medinensis. This is the roundest and longest worm among the group of worms that can cause parasitic infections in humans. Adult female dragon worms are 1-2 mm wide and about 70-120 cm long. Male worms are shorter, about 4 cm long. Male dragon worms will die after mating. (first)\n\nLife cycle of dragon worms\nDragon worms were mentioned in ancient Egypt in the early 15th century BC. Today, the disease is recorded to have appeared in India, Cameroon, Mauritania, Uganda, South Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Yemen, Ethiopia, Mali, etc. Dragon worm disease causes obsession for many people when they see the creature. parasitic under the skin, causing serious damage and pain.\nIn 1986, the World Health Organization launched a campaign to eradicate parasites, including dragon worms. The 1986 campaign had positive results, and in 2015 only 22 cases of the disease were recorded in four countries (Ethiopia, Chad, Mali and South Sudan). Vietnam has recorded 4 cases. In 2022, Vietnam also recorded a 42-year-old man in Yen Bai pulling out an 8cm long dragon worm from a burst pus nest. (2)\nThe patient has a habit of drinking stream water, eating fish salad... And recently, the patient continued to be hospitalized due to difficulty breathing, swelling in the chest, left arm, left thigh, pain and pus discharge.\n\nWhat is the cause of dragon worm disease?\nEach female dragon worm can carry 3 million larvae inside her. In the outside environment, larvae can live up to 3 weeks. Dragon worm larvae become food for Cyclops crustaceans (arthropods, water fleas), but when eaten by crustaceans, they can still live and survive for up to 4 months. Therefore, the spread of disease-causing larvae in humans and animals becomes easier and faster.\nDragon worms enter the bodies of humans and animals mainly through contaminated water sources, or the digestive tract when eating food contaminated with the bodies of small crustaceans (Cyclops) infected with worm larvae. Specifically, when aquatic species eat water fleas, they will be infected with larvae. From there, the larvae continue to parasitize the bodies of fish, shrimp, crabs, frogs...\nPeople and animals (dogs, cats, etc.) who eat raw or undercooked seafood are at risk of being infected with dragon worm larvae. In addition, patients can be infected with larvae by drinking water containing dead water fleas infected with worm larvae. Water sources that can contain dragon worm larvae are water in rivers, streams, ponds, lakes... The disease can occur in all ages with a morbidity rate of up to 60%.\nAfter a person swallows a water flea, gastric acid in the stomach causes the flea to die, and the body gradually dissolves, releasing dragon worm larvae. Larvae attached to the stomach take about 10 weeks to develop into worms. Worms penetrate through the wall of the stomach and small intestine into the abdominal cavity and retroperitoneal space. After mating, the male worm dies, the female worm matures and burrows into the host's skin to parasitize, causing clinical manifestations.\nThe time for the larvae to develop into worms and burrow into the host's skin lasts from 9 to 14 months, with almost no symptoms until the worm burrows into the skin. The head of the female dragon worm reaches the epidermis, causing blisters, which will burst when exposed to water, causing ulcers. After 2-3 weeks, when the ulcer comes into contact with water, the worms release their larvae into the environment. Some adult worms will crawl out, others can crawl back into the body, many will die in the host's body, decay and cause a severe inflammatory reaction.\nThe disease does not cause direct death but can cause indirect death from complications of the disease such as: secondary infection, cold abscess, joint infection, spinal cord paralysis, hemiplegia,...\nWater fleas swallow dragon worm larvae\nDragon worm disease is not seasonal but appears year-round. The length of time the number of cases increased varies from place to place. In dry places, dragon worms are often infected during the rainy season. On the contrary, places with a lot of rain are often infected with helminths in the dry season. The risk of disease does not discriminate between age and gender. However, according to statistics, the number of cases infected with this type of worm is mainly in the age group of 15 - 45 years old and working in agriculture. Therefore, people who often work in cattle raising, aquaculture, and farming are at high risk of getting sick, because they are often exposed to water sources containing dragon worm larvae. (3)\nDragon worms mature and burrow into the skin\n\nSigns of dragon worm disease\nAfter humans are infected with dragon worm larvae, they will be released in the stomach to develop into worms and penetrate the lining of the stomach, then continue to burrow into the connective tissue and move the subcutaneous tissues, usually the area. leg skin. The incubation process takes about 9 to 14 months, and the adult and parasitic female worms in humans can be up to 1 meter long. Before emerging from the skin, the female worm will create a painful and itchy blister. At this stage, if the blister breaks and comes into contact with water, it will create an opportunity for the female dragon worm to release the worm larvae into the environment.\nOnce infected with dragon worm larvae, the patient will have no symptoms for the first year. Symptoms usually only appear when the female worms begin to burrow into the skin and destroy tissue. When the worms begin to burrow into the skin, the patient will have symptoms such as:\nBlisters and swelling appear on the skin with a diameter of 2-7cm.; Numbness and severe itching; Feeling pain and burning in the damaged skin area; Hives, erythema.; Mild fever; Diarrhea.; Difficulty breathing, dizziness, vomiting; Severe dermatitis.\nDuring the process of laying eggs, worms can release toxins that cause serious ulcers and severe pain. When the swelling bursts and releases yellow fluid, the worm will poke its head out. If there is no impact, the worm will come out completely on its own after 3-6 weeks. Some female worms will crawl back deeper inside.\nAlong the path of the female dragon worm, it can cause secondary infections leading to sepsis. When secondary infection occurs, the patient will have symptoms related to inflammation and joint pain. If not treated promptly, the patient may face bone and joint sclerosis and ligament contractures.\n\nDiagnostic method\nDiagnosis of the disease is usually based on clinical symptoms such as: clearly seeing adult dragon worms burrowing under the skin, and in the ulcerated skin area, the head of the female dragon worm appears. X-rays can be taken to detect calcified worms in the host's body. Blood tests or examination of wound secretions can be done to diagnose. If you see increased eosinophilia in the blood and larvae in the wound secretions, you have dragonworm disease.\n\nComplications if Dracunculus worm disease is not treated promptly\nWhen suffering from dragon worm disease and clinical symptoms appear, if not treated promptly, the disease can cause dangerous complications such as: cellulitis, abscess, septicemia, tetanus, and inflammation. infected joints, joint deformities,...\nUp to now, the mortality rate from dragon worm disease is very low, but its complications can greatly affect the patient's life. Patients can be disabled for life due to superinfection. Dragon worm disease also affects the socio-economics as well as the health of the community due to complications.\n\nTreatment measures\nThere is currently no vaccine or medicine to treat dragon worm disease, but can only be treated symptomatically. Therefore, early detection and treatment will reduce dangerous complications.\nClean the wound and soak it in water: when diagnosed with dragon worm disease, the patient needs to limit contact with water sources. Clean the wound thoroughly. You can soak the wound in a basin of warm water to help the worms release all the larvae, making it easier to remove the worms. The water soaked in the wound should be treated with chemicals or boiled to kill the worm larvae.; Treat the wound with antibiotics: the patient needs to rest in bed, clean the ulcer and treat with local antibiotics to avoid secondary infection.; Pulling the worms out by hand: this is the traditional method of pulling the worms out with a small wooden stick. After the worms have released all their larvae, they will tend to crawl out. Wrap the worm's head around a wooden stick and slowly pull it out centimeter by centimeter, a little every day. Combined with use with anti-worm medication and wound sterilization makes it easier to pull the worms out. You should go to a medical facility to have the doctor pull the worm out, because if the worm is accidentally broken, it can cause the patient to have a secondary infection, causing sepsis or an abscess.; Take anti-worm medication: Using the anti-worm medication metronidazole and thiabendazole reduces symptoms and promotes worm burrowing or helps pull the worm out faster by hand. This medicine can help fight inflammation but cannot kill larvae and adult dragon worms.; Surgery to remove the worms: when the worms are parasitic under the skin, surgery can be performed to remove the worms. Surgery is only possible when the worms are not blocking the deep fascia or wrapping around the tendons.\n\nPreventing Dracunculus medinensis worm disease\nThe World Health Organization has launched a campaign to eliminate dragon worms, and it has almost been completely eradicated. However, dragon worm larvae can parasitize many hosts such as dogs, cats, seafood, etc., so preventing infection is still difficult. What is more worrying is that in recent years, Vietnam has recorded a number of cases of the disease.\nThe disease has no symptoms during the first year of incubation, so detection and treatment become difficult. So be proactive in preventing it with the following measures:\nEat cooked and drink boiled: worms and dragon worm larvae can die when exposed to hot temperatures above 100 degrees Celsius. Food should be completely cooked, especially seafood. You should clean the intestines of fish, frogs, shrimp, etc. before processing. Raw vegetables grown under water should be scalded with boiling water before eating or washed under clean, strong water.; Drinking water should be boiled or filtered by machine.; Only use clean water sources, if clean water sources cannot be used, people need to use water treatment measures such as: using water filtration equipment, insecticides in the water source to kill water fleas. . Do not feed dogs and cats fish, frogs, and seafood that have not been cooked; People with dragon worm disease need to cover the wound and not come into contact with clean water sources in the community to avoid female worms releasing eggs into the water environment, infecting everyone.; If your dog or cat shows symptoms such as: blisters, swelling, or worms appearing in the wound, they should avoid contact with clean community water sources.\nIn recent years, Vietnam has recorded a number of cases of dracunculus disease in humans and animals. Although the risk of death from the disease is low, complications from dragon worm disease can be dangerous to health, greatly affecting the patient's health.",
