If not detected and intervened promptly, the disease can lead to many dangerous complications and even death. The heart valve system is composed of mitral valve, tricuspid valve, aortic valve, and pulmonary valve. Heart valves have the role of directing the flow of blood in and out of the heart according to the one-way principle. Specifically, when blood from the atrium flows to the ventricle, the mitral valve and tricuspid valve will open, then the pulmonary valve and aortic valve will close. When blood is pumped from the ventricles to the lungs and circulatory system, the two pulmonary valves and the aortic valve open while the mitral valve and tricuspid valve close, preventing blood from refluxing into the two atrium chambers. Heart valve disease is a disease that occurs when one or more heart valves have functional problems, do not perform the function of opening and closing well, affecting the ability to direct blood flow in one direction. There are two most common types of heart valve abnormalities: heart valve regurgitation and stenosis.\n\nWhat is heart valve regurgitation?\nValvular regurgitation is a condition in which the heart valves do not close tightly, causing blood to flow back into the heart chambers every time the heart contracts. Therefore, the heart has to work harder to compensate for the lost blood volume due to reflux. The disease is divided into 4 types, corresponding to 4 heart valves:\nMitral valve regurgitation: blood refluxes from the left ventricle to the left atrium.; Tricuspid valve regurgitation: blood refluxes from the right ventricle to the right atrium.; Aortic regurgitation: blood refluxes from the aorta to the left ventricle.; Pulmonary valve regurgitation: blood refluxes from the pulmonary artery to the right ventricle.\nWith each type of heart valve regurgitation, there will be 4 levels of valve regurgitation: 1/4, 2/4, 3/4 and 4/4. Level 4/4 leak is the most severe, accompanied by many dangerous complications to the patient's health. (first)\nThe tricuspid valve and pulmonary valve often have mild physiological valve regurgitation.\n\nCauses of heart valve regurgitation\nDamage that causes the heart valve to leak can be divided into two groups: congenital causes and causes caused by the patient's acquired diseases. (2)\nCongenital causes: Common due to structural abnormalities of the aortic valve and mitral valve; Pathological cause: Acquired heart valve disease due to rheumatism: This condition occurs after rheumatism. This is also the type of open heart valve that accounts for the highest rate in Vietnam and developing countries. Acquired degenerative heart valve disease: The cause may be due to the degenerative process of old age, the valve is thick and calcified, and does not close tightly. Heart valve regurgitation due to myocardial infarction, myocardial dilatation, aortic aneurysm/dissection, infective endocarditis, etc. Mitral valve regurgitation due to valve prolapse, mitral valve ligament rupture, etc.; Acquired valvular heart disease due to rheumatism: This condition occurs after rheumatism. This is also the type of open heart valve that accounts for the highest rate in Vietnam and developing countries.; Acquired degenerative heart valve disease: The cause may be due to the degenerative process of old age, the valve is thick and calcified, and does not close tightly.; Heart valve regurgitation due to myocardial infarction, dilated myocardium, aortic aneurysm/dissection, infective endocarditis, etc.; Mitral valve regurgitation due to valve prolapse, mitral valve ligament rupture,...\n\nCommon signs of heart valve regurgitation\nHeart valve regurgitation has quite diverse symptoms, depending on the degree of regurgitation of the heart valve. With level 1/4 valve regurgitation, the patient has almost no symptoms and is very difficult to detect. Therefore, this condition is also called physiological valve regurgitation, and usually has little impact on health.\nFrom level 2/4 valve regurgitation, patients may experience symptoms such as:\nDifficulty breathing, especially when lying down or doing vigorous activities, there may be difficulty breathing at night.; Persistent fatigue even when inactive (reduced exercise tolerance).; Heart beats fast, palpitations continuously even when not active.; Dry cough, especially at night; Can't lie down with your head low.; Fainting.; Swollen ankles or feet.\nChest pain and difficulty breathing are typical symptoms of a leaky heart valve\nPatients with grade 2/4 valve regurgitation in the early stages often do not see obvious symptoms. When the level of valve regurgitation increases to 3/4, the disease progresses over many years, often symptoms or complications such as heart failure, arrhythmia, etc. will appear. The risk of heart failure in patients with valve regurgitation is at level 4/4. 4 is usually higher than the remaining 3 levels. In addition, patients at this level may also have arrhythmia, pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock...\n\nIs heart valve regurgitation dangerous?\nHeart valve regurgitation in particular and cardiovascular diseases in general all cause many health effects, even threatening the patient's life. Common complications of the disease are very diverse, the most common are complications related to the function of the heart, besides leaking heart valves can also impair the function of many other organs.\nHeart failure: This is a common complication in patients with abnormal heart valves because the heart has to work harder to compensate for the lack of blood. Over time, the heart chambers dilate and lead to heart failure.; Arrhythmia: This is a condition in which the heart beats abnormally, when it is too fast (frequency > 100 beats/minute) or too slow (frequency < 60 beats/minute), the heartbeat is irregular or sometimes fast and sometimes slow. Cardiac arrhythmia is the cause of 80% of sudden deaths; Infectious endocarditis: a common complication of aortic valve regurgitation, this condition occurs due to blood flowing backward from the aorta to the left ventricle, easily damaging the heart's endocardium. This area is where bacteria can easily stick, causing infection or abscess; Stroke: Patients with heart valve regurgitation experience complications of heart failure, dilated heart chambers, and arrhythmias that will create conditions for blood clots to form in the brain, causing a cerebrovascular accident (stroke).\n\nDiagnostic methods\nTo diagnose heart valve regurgitation, we need a clinical examination and appropriate laboratory testing. Clinical symptoms show signs of pathology (dyspnea, chest tightness, fainting...), medical history suggests the cause (congenital, myocardial infarction, trauma,...), cardiac examination with stethoscope. In people with leaky heart valves, when listening to the heart, you often hear a murmur due to abnormal blood flow in the heart.\nThe patient has an abnormal murmur when examined with a stethoscope.\nTo add accuracy to clinical conclusions, doctors often prescribe additional paraclinical diagnostic methods as follows:\nElectrocardiogram: This diagnostic method can show non-specific manifestations such as left atrial thickening, left ventricular thickening, atrial fibrillation, etc.; Chest X-ray: Can see an enlarged heart silhouette, interstitial edema, and alveolar edema, often seen in acute valve regurgitation or severe heart failure.; Doppler echocardiography: Is the most important method in accurately diagnosing heart valve regurgitation, helping to determine and evaluate the degree of valve regurgitation and the disease's impact on heart functions. This method can also help detect other cardiovascular diseases of the fetus.; Cardiac catheterization and angiography: This diagnostic method is usually only applied when other paraclinical methods cannot conclude the degree of heart valve regurgitation, evaluate heart function, or when surgery is planned.\nIn addition, there are a number of other paraclinical tests such as: Magnetic resonance imaging, CT scanner, hematology and blood chemistry tests... Depending on the condition of each patient, doctors will have specific instructions. to strengthen the accuracy of disease diagnoses.\n\nHow to treat leaky heart valves?\nDepending on the cause of the disease as well as the progression of the disease, the doctor will prescribe appropriate treatment for each case. Normally, at the level of 1/4 valve regurgitation and very mild symptoms, treatment intervention is not necessary.\nThe degree of 2/4 valve regurgitation is still considered mild, but if there are symptoms, doctors will prescribe the use of some medications such as diuretics (furosemide, spironolactone), afterload-reducing drugs, and antihistamines. Nitrate vasodilators, anticoagulants, beta blockers...\nIf the heart valve is open from 2/4 or more, the patient needs to have an early examination to determine the cause in order to come up with an appropriate treatment regimen. In case the valve leaks 3/4 or more, the patient must be treated actively and closely monitored.\nIn cases of severe heart valve regurgitation (3.5/4 or more), the doctor will decide whether to choose open heart surgery or percutaneous cardiac intervention based on the level of valve damage. In particular, open heart surgery is often applied in cases where the heart valve needs to be replaced, percutaneous intervention methods can be applied in some cases (mitral valve repair through a catheter - Mitra clip). (3)\nHeart valve replacement surgery is a method used in cases of severe leaking of the heart valve\nHeart valve regurgitation can lead to many dangerous complications, so when the patient is diagnosed, he or she needs to pay attention to complying with the treatment regimen from the doctor, using prescribed medications to control the symptoms of the disease, and prevent relapse. Regular check-ups as directed by your doctor. Patients are also recommended to check their blood pressure regularly and treat hypertension (if any) because high blood pressure will cause the heart to work harder.\nIn addition, people with heart valve disease need to pay attention to a bland, low-salt, low-fat diet and regularly check blood fat levels to prevent coronary artery disease; should not drink coffee. The use of alcoholic beverages should be limited because it can increase the severity of arrhythmia (if any). People with valve regurgitation also need to pay attention to weight control, avoid weight gain and obesity to reduce pressure on the heart.\n\nHow long can you live with heart valve regurgitation?\nThe prognosis of the disease depends on many factors such as the degree of valve regurgitation, the type of valve regurgitation, the time of disease detection, the underlying condition as well as treatment methods. In most cases, early detection and timely treatment will give good results, helping to prolong the patient's life.\nPatients with mitral valve regurgitation or aortic valve regurgitation often experience many serious complications and have a worse prognosis than the other two types of valve regurgitation. Heart valve regurgitation in the elderly with underlying diseases such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, heart failure... has a lower life expectancy than people with simple valve regurgitation. The results of some surveys show that mitral valve regurgitation accompanied by coronary artery disease after 5 years of follow-up has a mortality rate of up to 62%.\nWhen the patient is diagnosed early, the heart valve is not too leaky, there are few complications, treatment effectiveness and the chance of prolonging life will be higher than when detected in the severe leak stage. When the valve leaflets are seriously damaged, the risk of sudden death can appear at any time. Therefore, when a patient has been diagnosed with pathologically leaking heart valves (moderate to severe valve regurgitation), the patient needs to pay attention to monitoring and comply with the doctor's treatment instructions.\nTo date, heart valve replacement/repair is the only method to completely resolve heart valve damage. However, this method still has certain disadvantages and risks, but statistics show that heart valve replacement/repair significantly improves the patient's life expectancy.\nPatients can prolong their life if they strictly follow the doctor's treatment regimen\n\nHow to prevent early heart valve regurgitation?\nAlthough medicine is increasingly developing, until now, there is still no thorough treatment method to restore the original function of a leaky heart valve other than heart valve replacement/repair. Meanwhile, this method also has certain potential risks. Therefore, the role of disease prevention is even more important. The following notes can also be applied to people with heart valve regurgitation, supporting effective treatment.\nMaintain a healthy diet, full of vitamins and necessary nutrients from green vegetables, fruits, whole grains... to help strengthen resistance. Minimize foods containing too much fat, salt, sugar, processed foods... to help have a healthy heart.; Balance between rest and work to eliminate stress.; Increase regular exercise, pay attention to doing moderate physical activity; Maintain a stable weight, avoid obesity; Limit the use of tobacco, stimulants, alcoholic beverages such as wine, beer, etc. These risk factors not only threaten cardiovascular health but also affect many other functional organs.\nReference: What should people with heart valve insufficiency eat and avoid?\nAt Tam Anh General Hospital System, the Cardiovascular Center is invested in spacious construction, brings together experienced experts, and regularly updates new treatment regimens according to instructions from Cardiovascular Associations in Vietnam. and abroad. In addition, modern machinery system: CT scanner applying artificial intelligence, magnetic resonance imaging machine; Echocardiography machine, vascular ultrasound (carotid artery, peripheral blood vessels...) new generation 4D imaging, DSA system for 2-plane coronary angiography... help perform screening and diagnosis quickly, accurately, supporting effective treatment of cardiovascular diseases.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with experts at the Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nHeart valve regurgitation can occur at any age and gender, so everyone needs to proactively screen periodically at least every 6 months to detect early and prevent dangerous complications.",

Heart valve regurgitation in the elderly with underlying diseases such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, heart failure... has a lower life expectancy than people with simple valve regurgitation. The results of some surveys show that mitral valve regurgitation accompanied by coronary artery disease after 5 years of follow-up has a mortality rate of up to 62%.\nWhen the patient is diagnosed early, the heart valve is not too leaky, there are few complications, treatment effectiveness and the chance of prolonging life will be higher than when detected in the severe leak stage. When the valve leaflets are seriously damaged, the risk of sudden death can appear at any time. Therefore, when a patient has been diagnosed with pathologically leaking heart valves (moderate to severe valve regurgitation), the patient needs to pay attention to monitoring and comply with the doctor's treatment instructions.\nTo date, heart valve replacement/repair is the only method to completely resolve heart valve damage. However, this method still has certain disadvantages and risks, but statistics show that heart valve replacement/repair significantly improves the patient's life expectancy.\nPatients can prolong their life if they strictly follow the doctor's treatment regimen"
