    "content": "Peritoneal duct disease: Causes, diagnosis and treatment\n\nPeritoneal canal diseases (such as inguinal hernia, hydrocele and spermatic cord cyst) are quite common congenital diseases. One of the pediatric diseases\nmost common. Although most cases of the disease do not cause dangerous complications, it makes children feel uncomfortable and needs early treatment.\n\nWhat is Peritoneal Duct Disease?\nPeritoneal duct disease in boys is a disease that occurs due to abnormalities in the movement of the two testicles from the abdomen to the scrotum. Normally, during fetal life, a child's two testicles are formed and gradually develop in the abdomen. Towards the end of pregnancy, each testicle will create a passage called the peritoneal duct as it moves down into the scrotum. When this process is not complete, the child has peritoneal duct disease. Similarly in boys, if the round ligament in girls has difficulty moving down to the labia majora and is abnormal, it will also cause peritoneal duct diseases in girls.\nAccording to statistics, the rate of babies born with peritoneal duct disease is about 0.8 - 4.4% in full-term babies and up to 30% in premature babies. 80% of the peritoneal ducts are not occluded and this rate decreases rapidly in the first 6 months after birth.\n1. Inguinal hernias\nInguinal hernia is the most common type of hernia, can occur in both men and women, at any age. This is a condition in which abdominal organs and excess fat pass through natural holes in the groin (weak point of the abdominal wall), causing swelling or a small lump in the groin or scrotum, which can cause pain.\nInguinal hernias occur more often in men than in women. The incidence of this disease in male newborns ranges from 2-3% and less than 1% in female newborns.\nInguinal hernia in children\n2. Vitreous membrane\nHydrocele, also known as \"hydrocele disease\", is a condition in which after the testicles move to the scrotum, a small catheter from the abdomen to the child's scrotum remains, secreting fluid into the scrotum, causing the scrotum to swell and become swollen. . This condition is common in newborns and will disappear on its own when the child is 12 - 18 months old. In some cases, adult men can develop hydrocele due to inflammation or injury to the scrotum.\nNote, hydrocele does not cause pain for children, but if the child feels pain, parents need to take the child to the hospital for timely examination and medical intervention.\nHydrocele in children\n3. Sperm cord cyst\nSimilar to hydrocele, spermatic cord cysts in children also occur because the peritoneal tube still exists after the child is born, causing fluid to accumulate inside the scrotum, causing the scrotum to swell abnormally. However, the peritoneal tube in children with spermatic cord cysts is atrophied in the upper part, making it impossible for fluid to flow back into the abdominal wall.\n\nCauses of peritoneal duct disease\nPeritoneal duct disease in newborns occurs when the peritoneal duct does not close completely, creating a weak spot in the abdominal wall. In addition, some factors that increase the risk of these diseases include:\nGenetic factors.; Gender: Men have a higher risk of developing peritoneal duct disease than women.; During pregnancy, pregnant women smoke or are often exposed to polluted environments; Premature birth…\n\nCan peritoneal duct disease be prevented?\nPeritoneal duct diseases in children are not related to nutrition, medication or lifestyle of the mother during pregnancy. Therefore, there is currently no preventative measure.\n\nSymptoms of peritoneal duct disease\n1. Inguinal hernias\nChildren with an inguinal hernia will have an abnormal round mass in the groin. This round mass can appear immediately after birth or a few weeks, months or years later and tends to move toward the scrotum when the baby cries or strains to have a bowel movement.\nBesides, an inguinal hernia can cause children to feel pain, discomfort, a burning sensation and heaviness in the groin area, scrotal swelling, etc. These symptoms are quite similar to the symptoms of diseases of the reproductive organs. other education, therefore, to know the exact condition of the child, parents should take the child to the hospital for examination, diagnosis and appropriate treatment support.\nThe child has an unusual round mass in the groin area caused by an inguinal hernia\n2. Hydrocele\nHydrocele in children does not cause pain but causes the scrotal area of ​​one or both testicles to swell. Sometimes, this swollen area may be smaller in the morning and larger in the evening. (first)\nIf hydrocele occurs in adult men, they may feel discomfort due to a swollen, heavy scrotum. The pain level of this pain gradually increases with the level of inflammation caused by the disease.\n3. Sperm cord cyst\nChildren with spermatic cord cysts will have an unusual bulge in the groin or scrotum compared to the other side. This bulge is tight, painless, and can appear regularly or intermittently.\n\nDiagnosis of peritoneal duct disease\nThrough physical examination and examination while standing, coughing, or pushing, the doctor can determine whether the bulge is caused by fluid or herniated organs. For suspected cases of hydrocele or inguinal hernia, the doctor may use a flashlight to examine more closely. If the bulge can push back into the abdomen, the child has an uninvolved inguinal hernia. At the same time, the doctor will check whether both testicles are in the scrotum or not during the examination.\nIn addition, the doctor may prescribe other medical procedures to support the diagnosis of the child's disease such as:\nSupersonic;; CT scan;; MRI scan.\n\nHow to treat peritoneal duct disease\nMost children with hydrocele will go away on their own within a few months of birth. In some cases the disease can last longer, but if after 2 years of age the disease usually does not go away on its own, the child needs surgery as soon as possible.\nIn cases of children with inguinal hernia, the child needs to be detected and have surgery arranged as soon as possible because the inguinal hernia is not strangulated: it does not heal on its own, surgery should be performed as soon as the diagnosis is made to avoid complications of strangulation (69). % in the first year), testicular atrophy secondary to frequent downward regression. Strangulated inguinal hernia: emergency surgery.\nBecause when the intestines get stuck in the hernia, the intestinal blood flow decreases, which can cause dangerous complications such as intestinal necrosis, intestinal perforation, and peritonitis.\nInguinal hernia in children before and after surgery\n1. Prepare before surgery\nWhen surgery is scheduled, the consultant will advise parents about the appropriate nutritional regimen for the child. Parents need to follow the instructions of doctors and nutritionists to avoid affecting the upcoming surgery.\nAfter being admitted to the hospital, the surgeon will clearly explain the surgical process, answer parents' questions (if any) and ask parents to sign a surgical commitment before proceeding.\nBefore surgery, to ensure that the baby does not experience drug resistance or allergy to the drug, the anesthesiologist will check the body's reaction to the anesthetic used during the surgery, and at the same time, treat the problem. Enjoy the anesthesia process and reduce post-operative pain for parents. If the child has any medical diseases, such as allergies, asthma, congenital heart disease, etc., or is taking any medications, parents should promptly notify the doctor in charge for appropriate treatment. and the safest.\n2. Care after surgery\nAfter surgery, the child rests and is cared for in the recovery room until fully awake. At this point, children can:\nDischarge from the hospital if the child feels comfortable, health and spirit are stable.; Drink milk normally.; Drink a lot of water.; Wear loose clothing that does not press on the incision.\n3. Monitor at home\nMost children after surgery to treat peritoneal duct disease will feel pain and discomfort for the first 1-2 days afterward. Parents can consult a doctor about appropriate pain relievers and dosages to help their children feel more comfortable.\nAlthough children can go home as soon as they wake up after surgery, parents should note that they should not bathe their children within 2 days after surgery. After that, the child can bathe but limit water contact with the incision and clean according to the instructions of the medical staff. About a week later, the child can go to school but avoid vigorous exercise that will affect the wound.\nIn particular, if your child has the following conditions, he or she should be taken to the hospital immediately:\nChildren have a lot of pain and painkillers are not effective; Children have high fever, no signs of cooling down after taking fever-reducing medicine; The inflamed incision is red, painful, and hotter than the surrounding skin; Exudate appears from the surgical wound\nFor more information about how to take care of your child and other health issues, you can contact the Neonatal Center, Tam Anh General Hospital at:\nThrough Dr. Nguyen Do Trong's sharing about peritoneal duct disease in children, we hope parents have a better understanding of these diseases. In the process of caring for their children, parents should pay attention to early detection of abnormal signs in their children to quickly detect and treat their children's illnesses, reducing the risk of unwanted risks.",
