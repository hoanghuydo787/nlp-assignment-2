    "content": "Moyamoya disease: Warning symptoms and treatment\n\nMoyamoya disease is a chronic and naturally progressive disease of the cerebral arteries. If left untreated, the disease can cause ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke. People with Moyamoya disease are characterized by gradual narrowing of blood vessels and possible blockages due to overgrowth of the inner lining of some brain arteries. Moyamoya disease is usually diagnosed in children 10 to 14 years old, or adults in their 40s. Women and people of Asian origin are at higher risk of Moyamoya disease. The disease has a genetic factor.\n\nWhat is Moyamoya disease?\nThe term “Moyamoya” in Japanese, refers to a mist or misty cloud. The disease is so named because the cerebral blood vessels are damaged and gradually narrowed, leading to increasingly insufficient cerebral blood flow to supply blood to the brain. The body will compensate by developing a secondary blood vessel network, including small neovascular vessels to try to compensate for cerebral ischemia - According to TTND. Associate Professor, Dr. Tran Duy Anh - Director of Internal Medicine , Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi.\nThese new blood vessels are very thin and fragile, causing brain hemorrhage. Therefore, in people with Moyamoya disease, when having a cerebral angiogram, the cerebral blood vessel network appears with a pale, hazy image as if covered by a thin cloud or a puff of smoke.\n“Moyamoya disease” is different from “Moyamoya syndrome”. In Moyamoya syndrome, patients show similar images of cerebral vascular damage, but the underdevelopment of the cerebral vascular network here is due to other mechanisms, not related to genetic mutations as in Moyamoya disease. (first)\n\nSymptoms of Moyamoya disease\nIf Moyamoya disease is not treated promptly, there is a risk of hemorrhage or stroke. Not only that, the disease occurs at a young age, so it risks leading to mental retardation and chronic nerve damage. Some symptoms of the disease include:\nHeadache; Dizzy; Sensory impairment; Muscle weakness; There are involuntary movements; Voice disorders; Epileptic seizures; Paralysis in one limb or one side of the body\nSevere, sudden symptoms can be: (2)\nRecurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA or “mini-stroke”); Ischemic stroke (due to blockage of cerebral vessels) or hemorrhagic stroke (bleeding in the brain).; TIAs, strokes, and intracranial hemorrhage are neurological emergencies that require immediate treatment.; Thinking and memory decline due to repeated strokes and bleeding.\n\nTreatment of Moyamoya disease\nAssociate Professor Tran Duy Anh said that Moyamoya disease can be treated with medication or surgery to control symptoms. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms, improve cerebral blood flow, and reduce the risk of serious complications such as ischemic stroke and fatal bleeding in the brain. The prognosis for Moyamoya disease depends on a number of factors such as age, whether the disease is detected early, damage that has occurred, whether the patient responds to treatment, etc. (3)\nDrug treatment\nA number of medications may be prescribed to help control symptoms, reduce the risk of stroke or assist in controlling seizures, including:\nBlood thinners: After being diagnosed with Moyamoya disease, if symptoms are mild or absent at first, your doctor may prescribe aspirin or another blood thinner to prevent stroke. ; Calcium channel blockers: Also known as calcium antagonists, this type of medication may be helpful in controlling headache symptoms and may reduce symptoms associated with transient ischemic attacks via. These medications can help control blood pressure, which is essential in people with Moyamoya disease to prevent brain damage.; Antiepileptic drugs: These drugs are prescribed for people who have seizures. Some other medications to help people with Moyamoya treat the symptoms of the disease.\nSome medications can help people with Moyamoya treat the symptoms of the disease\nSurgical treatment\nEarly surgical treatment can help slow the progression of Moyamoya disease. Especially if mild stroke symptoms have occurred and/or tests show evidence of low blood flow to the brain, which are indications for revascularization surgery.\nIn revascularization surgery, the surgeon \"bypasses\" blocked arteries by connecting blood vessels from outside the skull to inside the skull to help restore blood flow. to the brain. There are 2 recanalization techniques: direct or indirect, or a combination of both. (4)\nDirect revascularization procedures. In direct revascularization surgery, the surgeon sutures (connects) the extracranial artery directly to the cerebral artery, for example: Bypassing the temporal artery to the middle cerebral artery to increase blood flow to the brain immediately.; Direct bypass surgery can be difficult to perform in children due to the small size of the blood vessels, but it is preferred in adults. This surgery can be performed safely and effectively by experienced surgeons.; Indirect revascularization procedures. In indirect recirculation, the goal is to create a neovascular system over a certain period of time (several months) on the surface of the brain to increase blood flow to the brain.\n“In some major surgical centers around the world, people do a combination of both indirect revascularization and direct revascularization for adult Moyamoya patients.” Associate Professor Tran Duy Anh evaluated.\nDirect bypass surgery\nSome indirect revascularization procedures include: EDAS procedure (Encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis); or EMS (Encephalomyosynangiosis) procedure or a combination of both.\nTo perform the EDAS procedure, the doctor will remove a scalp artery several inches long and then thread it into the skull through a drilled hole. The scalp arteries will be placed intact on the surface of the brain. After a period of time, new blood vessels from the arteries under the scalp will grow on the surface of the patient's brain. The EMS procedure selects the temporal muscle artery and places it on the surface of the patient's brain through a skull opening to help restore blood flow.\nRevascularization procedures carry some risks, however, the benefits of the surgery far outweigh the risks.\nEDAS indirect surgery\nPhysical therapy treatment\nWithout surgery, Moyamoya disease can cause mental decline due to narrowed blood vessels. Physical therapy and occupational therapy can help regain any physical function lost due to a stroke and can help improve thinking and memory skills. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help with emotional issues related to Moyamoya disease, such as how to cope with fears about future strokes.\nTo schedule an examination and consultation on health issues at Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:",
