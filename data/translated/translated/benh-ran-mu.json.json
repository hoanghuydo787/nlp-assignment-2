    "content": "Pubic lice: Causes, signs, treatment, prevention\n\nPubic lice are a common genital disease. Dr. Cameron Webb, a scientist at the University of Sydney (Australia), warned that up to 750,000 people using the dating application Tinder are infected with pubic lice. The article below shares the causes, signs, treatment, and prevention of pubic lice.\n\nWhat are pubic lice?\nPubic lice are small insects that live on human pubic hair\nPubic lice is a disease that causes itching in the private area or the area around the genitals. Patients have an itchy feeling that lasts about 5 days after being infected with pubic lice, this feeling will be more intense at night. (first)\nPubic lice are small insects that live on the pubic hair (hair area around the genitals) of humans. Pubic lice are classified as parasites because they suck human blood to survive.\nPubic lice are different from pubic lice (lice) that exist in hair or on the human body. However, this type of lice can appear on other parts of the body that have coarse hair, including:\nArmpit.; Beard, mustache or facial hair.; Chest.; Eyebrows and eyelashes (more common in children).\n\nSigns of pubic lice are common\nSymptoms of pubic lice appear about 5 days after infection. The most common is a feeling of intense itching in the pubic area due to the body's reaction to the louse bites. However, some people do not notice or think they have a rash...(2)\nSymptoms of pubic lice in private areas include:\nSevere itching in the genital area; Spot microscopic lice in the pubic area by looking closely or perhaps using a magnifying glass. Pubic lice are grayish brown or grayish white and look like small crabs. The color of pubic lice will become darker when they are full of blood.; People with pubic lice will find lice eggs located at the base of their pubic hair. Pubic lice eggs are very small, oval-shaped, white or yellow and located in clusters; Blue spots appear on the skin bitten by pubic lice; Mild fever, malaise or fatigue; Brown or dark red spots appear inside underwear (pubic lice feces).\n\nCauses of pubic lice\nPubic lice are spread from person to person through close contact, especially sexual intercourse. In addition, sharing personal items such as towels, bed sheets and clothes also indirectly causes pubic lice.\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nPatients need to see a Dermatologist - Skin Aesthetics specialist in the following cases: (3)\nNon-prescription medicinal products are not very effective.; The patient is pregnant.; The patient has abrasions on the skin that are infected due to scratching.\n\nRisk factors increase the likelihood of infection\nRisk factors that increase the likelihood of getting pubic lice include:\nHaving sex with someone who has pubic lice; Have many different sexual partners.; Sharing clothes, towels, and bed sheets.\nSubjects are likely to be infected\nAnyone can be infected with pubic lice. This disease is most common in adolescents and adults. However, children and older adults are still at risk of getting pubic lice.\n\nAre pubic lice dangerous? Complications may occur\nPubic lice do not cause serious health problems. The most common main symptom of the disease is a feeling of itching and discomfort. Treatment time for pubic lice ranges from about 2 weeks. The disease can recur and the patient needs to repeat treatment if not prevented.\nBelow are common complications of pubic lice:\nUlcers and skin infections due to scratching too much; Conjunctivitis in people with pubic lice on eyelashes; The disease can recur if louse eggs remain.\n\nDiagnosis of pubic lice\nDermatologists - Skin Aesthetics diagnose pubic lice by examining and using a magnifying glass to check whether pubic lice exist in genital hair or not. In some cases, pubic lice are also found in organs other than the genital area (eyelashes).\n\nMethods of treating pubic lice\n1. Notes for people with pubic lice\nDermatologists - Skin Aesthetics prescribe patients to use specific soaps, sprays and creams to treat pubic lice, which are over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. To ensure the best treatment effectiveness, patients need to follow these steps:\nWhen pubic lice are detected, the patient needs to take a bath, wash clothes and bedding; Monitor and clean areas of body hair with pubic lice.; Apply specific cream to areas of hair with pubic lice as prescribed by your doctor. Pubic lice are usually treated with permethrin cream (A-200, Nix and RID,). Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should see a doctor for advice on safer products.; Pubic lice can be removed from the body using soap, shampoo, and other forms of over-the-counter topical products. Read the instructions carefully to know the exact dosage, frequency and time to keep the product on the skin before rinsing with water. When over-the-counter topical products are less effective, prescription medications may be needed.; After treatment, there are cases where some stubborn louse eggs still exist on the hair. Patients can use a magnifying glass to look closely and remove remaining eggs with a wide-tooth comb, tweezers or fingers.; Not only applying treatments on the body, patients need to clean and disinfect their homes and objects they have come into contact with. Vacuum, clean the house and bathroom with cleaning solution. Wash all towels, sheets, blankets, and clothing with soap and hot water, then dry in the sun or tumble dry (the heat from the dryer kills pubic lice).; For some types of clothes that cannot be washed in water, they must be dry cleaned and placed in a sealed plastic bag for 72 hours.; To avoid infection, people with pubic lice need to avoid having sex with others during treatment and vice versa.\n2. Treat pubic lice with medication\nIf lice are still alive after applying all of the above treatments, stronger drugs such as:\nMalathion (Ovide): topical lotion, used to apply to areas with lice and leave for 8-12 hours.; Ivermectin (Stromectol): oral tablet.; Lindane: the strongest prescription pubic lice treatment, just leave the product on the affected area for 4 minutes then rinse. Dermatologists - Skin Aesthetics recommend not using this product for infants, pregnant or breastfeeding women.; For pubic lice in the eyelashes, you can use tweezers to pick up the lice and eggs or use a cotton swab soaked in a little Vaseline to apply to the eyelashes at night before going to bed (be sure to wash it off the next morning). Do this continuously for several weeks, but be careful not to get it in your eyes.; However, to treat lice around the eyes effectively and safely, patients should consult a doctor to be prescribed a suitable and safe method of treating pubic lice around the eyes.; There is an itchy feeling that lasts for about 2 weeks due to the body's reaction to the pubic lice bite; In case the bite is red, swollen, the skin changes color (the skin color is not normal but turns bluish) or oozing from the wound, you should see a doctor immediately.\n\nHow to prevent pubic lice from coming back\nWhen you suspect you have or have recurring pubic lice, you should see a Dermatologist - Skin Aesthetics specialist\nTo reduce the risk of getting pubic lice or prevent the disease from returning, patients can do the following:\nDo not have close contact or have sex with people who have pubic lice; Avoid sharing personal items such as clothes or towels; Limit the number of sexual partners, avoid having sex with people who have many partners.; When going shopping, you need to wear underwear when trying on clothes.; When you suspect you have or have recurring pubic lice, you should see a Dermatologist - Skin Aesthetics specialist for advice on appropriate treatment.\nPubic lice is a common genital disease that has the risk of spreading quickly but is not dangerous. When you detect signs of infection, you should immediately go to a medical facility and see a Dermatologist - Skin Aesthetics specialist for timely examination and treatment.",
