    "content": "Diabetic neuropathy: Signs, causes and treatment\n\nPeople with diabetes who do not control their blood sugar well are at high risk of diabetic neuropathy, causing serious complications such as: amputation, gastroparesis, neurogenic bladder, postural hypotension, etc. affect quality of life.\n\nWhat is diabetic neuropathy?\nDoctor Phan Thi Thuy Dung, Department of Endocrinology - Diabetes, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, said diabetic neuropathy is a common complication in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. High levels can damage nerves throughout the body. (first)\nDepending on the location of the damaged nerve, the disease will have different symptoms. Most people with diabetes have nerve damage in their legs, symptoms include: Pain and numbness, paresthesias, tingling sensations, tingling, etc. in the legs and feet. If not treated promptly, the patient has a high risk of limb amputation. Diabetic neuropathy also causes damage to other organs such as digestion, heart, blood vessels, urinary tract, etc.\nDiabetic neuropathy affects up to 50% of people with diabetes but can be prevented or slowed by good control of blood sugar levels.\n\nCauses of diabetic neuropathy\nDr. Dung said: The cause of diabetic neuropathy is still unknown. Researchers believe that uncontrolled high blood sugar levels for long periods of time will damage nerves. High blood sugar also damages the small blood vessels responsible for nourishing the nerves, causing loss or reduction of the function of providing oxygen and nutrients to the nerves, thereby damaging the nerves and causing cause diabetic neuropathy.\n\nSymptoms of diabetic neuropathy\nThere are 4 types of diabetic neuropathy, each type will cause damage in a certain location and have different symptoms including: (2)\nPeripheral neuropathy: Usually affects the nerves of the feet and legs, and can occasionally affect the nerves of the hands and forearms. Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy include: Tingling, numbness, prickling sensation, tingling, foot pain, loss of feeling in the feet, slipping off sandals, etc. About ⅓ to ½ of diabetics There are peripheral nerve complications and this is the most common form of neuropathy in diabetic patients.; Autonomic neuropathy: The disease affects the autonomic nerves of the digestive system, cardiovascular system, urinary system and genital organs, sweat glands, eyes, loss of ability to recognize signs of hypoglycemia. Autonomic nerves in the digestive system can affect any part of the digestive system such as esophageal motility disorders causing difficulty swallowing, patients will have symptoms of gastroparesis such as bloating, flatulence, and overeating. indigestion, nausea, vomiting, constipation or loose stools, involuntary bowel movements. Autonomic neuropathy in the cardiovascular system will have symptoms such as: Dizziness when changing positions, tachycardia at rest, postural hypotension, etc. Damage to the autonomic nerves in the genital system will cause symptoms. Symptoms such as erectile dysfunction and retrograde ejaculation in men. In women, symptoms appear such as decreased libido, decreased lubrication, vaginal dryness, and increased pain during intercourse. Damage to autonomic nerves in the urinary system causes diabetic neuropathy, patients have symptoms such as urinary incontinence, frequent nocturia, frequent urination, urgency or urinary retention, and water flow. Weak urination. Abnormal hyperhidrosis or hypohidrosis. A dangerous complication is that the patient loses the ability to recognize the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, leading to hypoglycemic coma.; Autonomic neuropathy in the digestive system can affect any part of the digestive system such as esophageal motility disorders causing difficulty swallowing, patients will have symptoms of gastroparesis such as bloating, flatulence, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, constipation or loose stools, involuntary bowel movements; Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy will have symptoms such as: Dizziness when changing positions, tachycardia when resting, postural hypotension,...; Damage to autonomic nerves in the reproductive system will cause symptoms such as erectile dysfunction and retrograde ejaculation in men. In women, symptoms appear such as decreased libido, decreased lubrication, vaginal dryness, increased pain during intercourse.; Damage to autonomic nerves in the urinary system causes diabetic neuropathy, patients have symptoms such as urinary incontinence, frequent nocturia, frequent urination, urgency or urinary retention, and water flow. Weak urination; Abnormal hyperhidrosis or hypohidrosis; A dangerous complication is that the patient loses the ability to recognize the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, leading to hypoglycemic coma.\nMononeuropathy: Is a condition in which single nerves are damaged; nerve damage can occur in the arms, head, trunk, or legs. The most common are nerve compression injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome causing pain, numbness, hand muscle atrophy... Other forms of localized nerve damage are less common. Cranial neuropathies present acutely and are rare, mainly involving cranial nerves III, IV, VI and VII, and usually resolve spontaneously within a few months.; Plexus-radicular disease: Muscle atrophy due to diabetes or polyneuropathy often involves the lumbosacral plexus. The disease often presents with pain on one side of the thigh and weight loss, followed by weakness of movement. These disorders are often self-limiting and improve over time with treatment and physical therapy.\n\nComplications of diabetic neuropathy\nAccording to Dr. Dung, diabetic neuropathy causes a number of serious complications including:\nUnaware hypoglycemia: The patient has low blood sugar levels but does not know it and can lead to hypoglycemic coma.; Limb amputation is a serious complication, leaving lifelong sequelae and affecting quality of life. Loss of feeling in the feet, slipping off sandals without knowing increases the risk of foot ulcers and amputation; Neurogenic bladder causes urinary incontinence or urinary retention, increasing the risk of urinary tract infections; Postural hypotension causes dizziness and lightheadedness when changing positions, which can lead to falls; Digestive problems such as difficulty swallowing, bloating, gas, nausea, vomiting, incontinence, diarrhea or constipation affect quality of life; Sexual dysfunction in men and women affects sex life.\n\nDiagnosis of diabetic neuropathy\nDiagnosis of diabetic neuropathy is a diagnosis after excluding other causes such as alcoholism, vitamin B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, kidney disease, etc. Patients need to be screened for diabetic neuropathy immediately. when first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and 5 years after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and then at least once a year. Patients will be explored for symptoms and signs of diabetic neuropathy and examined with specialized tools to diagnose the disease. (3)\n\nTreatment of diabetic neuropathy\nDr. Phan Thi Thuy Dung said: Treatment of diabetic neuropathy focuses on the following issues:\nSlow down disease progression: To slow down disease progression, it is necessary to control blood sugar levels well. Maintaining average blood sugar levels can reduce the risk of disease progression by about 60%. Blood sugar goals to be achieved include: Fasting or pre-meal blood sugar: 70 - 130 mg/dL. Blood sugar after 2 hours of eating: < 180 mg/dL. HbA1c is less than 7%. In addition, patients need to take good care of their feet to avoid damage that causes ulcers. Control blood pressure. Eat and drink in moderation as directed by your doctor. Exercise regularly. Maintain a moderate weight. No smoking. Do not drink alcohol; Blood sugar when fasting or before meals: 70 – 130 mg/dL.; Blood sugar 2 hours after eating: < 180 mg/dL.; HbA1c less than 7%.; In addition, patients need to take good care of their feet to avoid damage that causes ulcers; Blood pressure control.; Eat and drink in moderation according to your doctor's instructions.; Exercise regularly; Maintain a moderate weight.; No smoking.; Don't drink alcohol.\nUse symptom-relieving medications as prescribed by your doctor; Treatment of complications and rehabilitation for patients with neurogenic bladder disease, limb amputation,...\n\nPrevention of diabetic neuropathy\nSubjects at risk of diabetic neuropathy include: Being overweight, having high blood pressure and blood lipids, progressive kidney disease, drinking a lot of alcoholic beverages and smoking. Therefore, to prevent diabetic neuropathy complications, patients need to control blood sugar well, regularly monitor blood sugar and blood pressure, eat moderately according to doctor's instructions, exercise regularly and Take care of your feet, stop smoking, limit alcoholic beverages, and have regular health check-ups.\nDiabetic neuropathy is one of the major causes of complications for diabetic patients. Patients should not be subjective in taking care of their health and measuring blood sugar daily. If you notice health abnormalities, you need to go to the hospital for timely examination and treatment to avoid serious complications.",
