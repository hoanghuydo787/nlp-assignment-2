    "content": "Peripheral neuropathy: Causes, symptoms and treatments\n\nPeripheral neuropathy causes weakness, numbness and pain in the periphery such as the hands and feet and can also affect other internal organs such as the digestive tract and circulation. Doctor, Doctor II Vo Don, Department of Neurology, Tam Anh General Hospital, said that understanding the disease can help people prevent, diagnose and treat promptly and effectively, avoiding serious complications.\nPeripheral neuropathy causes weakness, numbness and pain in the periphery such as the hands and feet and can also affect internal organs.\n\nWhat is peripheral neuropathy?\nThe peripheral nervous system (HTKNB) is a part of the nervous system, including the nucleus and cranial nerves, anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, nerve ganglia outside the brain and spinal canal, roots and nerve branches. spinal nerves, nerve plexuses, peripheral nerves. The main function of the internal nervous system is to link the central nervous system with the limbs and organs. Unlike the central nervous system, the central nervous system is not protected by the spine and skull or the blood-brain barrier, so it is susceptible to the effects of toxins and mechanical damage from the outside.\nPeripheral neuropathy is not a separate condition. It is a general term for a number of diseases caused by damage to the body's peripheral nervous system.(1)\nThe body's nervous system is made up of two parts:\nCentral nervous system (CNS: central nervous system) includes the brain and spinal cord.; The peripheral nervous system (PNS: peripheral nervous system) connects nerves originating from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body such as the upper limbs (arms, forearms, hands); Lower extremities (thighs, legs, feet); Internal organs in the body, joints and even the mouth, eyes, ears, nose and skin.\nPeripheral neuropathy occurs when nerves are damaged or destroyed by a variety of mechanisms and are unable to send messages from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles, skin, other parts of the body, and vice versa.\nPeripheral neuropathy can affect multiple nerves on both sides (bilateral asymmetric nerve damage, polyneuropathy), symmetric damage, or just one nerve or group of nerves. nerve (mononeuropathy) at one time.\nSciatica is often the result of damage to a nerve or group of nerves due to trauma, localized compression, prolonged pressure or inflammation, such as:\nCarpal tunnel syndrome (pain and numbness in the hands and fingers, often related to work due to repetitive wrist compression causing nerve compression).; Peripheral seventh nerve paralysis (also called peripheral facial paralysis or Bell's palsy).\n\nSymptoms of peripheral neuropathy\nEach nerve in the peripheral system has a distinct function, so symptoms of the disease will depend on each peripheral nerve affected. Nerves are classified into:(3)\nSensory nerves receive sensations, such as temperature, pain, vibration or touch, from the skin.; Motor nerves control muscle movement; Mixed nerves control both movement and sensation; The autonomic/autonomic nerves control functions such as blood pressure, sweating, heart rate, digestion and bladder function.\nAccordingly, symptoms of peripheral neuropathy may include:\nFeeling of wearing “gloves” or “wearing socks”.; Burning or sharp pain; Stinging or electric shock-like pain when the skin is irritated; Difficulty sleeping due to tired and sore feet; Loss of balance and coordination; Muscle weakness; Muscle spasms/twitches; Difficulty walking or moving your arms; Abnormal sweating; Abnormalities in blood pressure or fast or slow pulse; Dry, pale green skin\nSymptoms include weakness in the limbs such as not being able to hold anything, feeling like your feet are peeling or not being able to recognize when touching the ground or wearing slippers, and feeling pain like being stabbed or burned in your hands and feet. may be common signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.\nNeurological disease, also known as neurological disorder, is a disease that affects the nerves, brain, roots, plexuses, etc. It is necessary to understand the causes, symptoms and treatment of the disease.\n\nCauses/factors/risks of peripheral neuropathy\nPeripheral neuropathy is nerve damage caused by a number of different diseases.

Nerve pressure can also be caused by wearing a cast or using crutches or repeating a movement such as tapping over and over.\nVitamin deficiency: B vitamins, especially vitamins B1, B6, B12; vitamin E and niacin are important for nerve health. A deficiency of these vitamins in the body can cause peripheral neuropathy; Vitamin deficiency: B vitamins, especially vitamins B1, B6, B12; vitamin E and niacin are important for nerve health. A deficiency in these vitamins in the body can cause peripheral neuropathy.\nHowever, in some cases, even with extensive evaluation, the cause of peripheral neuropathy in some people remains unknown – this is called idiopathic neuropathy.\n\nComplications of peripheral neuropathy\nComplications of peripheral neuropathy may include:\nBurns and skin wounds: The patient may not feel temperature changes or pain on frostbitten parts of the body.; Burns and skin wounds: People may not feel temperature changes or pain on frostbitten parts of the body.\nInfection: Feet and other areas lacking sensation may be injured without the patient knowing. Doctor Vo Don advises that patients should check these areas regularly and treat small wounds to avoid infection, especially in patients with diabetes.; Infection: Feet and other areas lacking sensation may be injured without the patient knowing. Dr. Vo Don advises that patients should check these areas regularly and treat small wounds to avoid infection, especially in patients with diabetes.\nFalls: Weakness and loss of feeling in the limbs can make the patient susceptible to losing balance and falling.; Falls: Weakness and loss of feeling in the limbs can make the patient more likely to lose balance and fall.\nPeople with peripheral neuropathy are prone to falls due to loss of balance, so they need to pay close attention in daily life\n\nDiagnosis method of peripheral neuropathy\nBefore diagnosing peripheral neuropathy, your doctor will review your medical history and conduct a physical exam to evaluate your nerves. After a neurological evaluation, depending on the symptoms and results of the neurological evaluation, the patient may have other tests that help the doctor determine the type of peripheral neuropathy including:\nNeuromuscular electromyography: Electromyography can show problems with how the body's nerve signals travel to the muscles. For this test, the doctor will place a small needle into the patient's muscle. Then, the doctor will ask the patient to gently move the muscles. The probe in the needle will measure the amount of electricity moving through the patient's muscles, from which the doctor can determine whether there is nerve damage, the extent of the damage, and the type of disease causing the damage.; Neuromuscular electromyography: Electromyography can show problems with how the body's nerve signals travel to the muscles.

They then pulse a small amount of electrodes through the nerves to see if the nerves are transmitting signals properly.; Lumbar puncture: This method is performed by the doctor placing electrodes on the patient's skin. They then pulse a small amount of electrodes through the nerves to see if the nerves are transmitting signals properly.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI): The doctor may also ask the patient to have an MRI to see if there is anything pressing on the nerve, such as a herniated disc or tumor.; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): The doctor may also ask the patient for an MRI to see if there is anything pressing on the nerve, such as a herniated disc or tumor.\n\nTreatment methods for peripheral neuropathy\nTreatment is based on treating the underlying disorder. For example, if diabetes is the cause, good blood sugar control is needed. If a vitamin deficiency is the cause, it can be treated by supplementing the missing vitamins... Many treatments can help relieve symptoms and return the person to daily activities. Sometimes, combining treatment methods can provide the best treatment results.\nPain relievers: Over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen can help control moderate pain. But if the patient takes too much, these drugs can negatively affect liver or stomach function. Therefore, patients need to use it as directed and should not use it for a long time, especially for those who often drink alcohol.; Pain relievers: Over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen can help control moderate pain. But if the patient takes too much, these drugs can negatively affect liver or stomach function. Therefore, patients need to use it as directed and should not use it for a long time, especially for those who often drink alcohol.\nPrescription medications: Many prescription pain medications can also help control pain caused by peripheral neuropathy, such as some anti-seizure medications and some antidepressants. Additionally, other prescription medications include: Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors; tramadol; corticosteroid injections; seizure medication such as gabapentin or pregabalin; antidepressants such as amitriptyline; Cymbalta (a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor); Prescription medications for sexual dysfunction in men include: sildenafil (Viagra); vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn); tadalafil (Cialis); avanafil (Stendra).; Prescription medications: Many prescription pain medications can also help control pain caused by peripheral neuropathy, such as some anti-seizure medications and some antidepressants.

Both alcohol and tobacco worsen peripheral neuropathy and can cause nerve damage with long-term use. At the same time, patients need to pay attention to staying safe to avoid accidents due to loss of balance or loss of sensation caused by peripheral neuropathy such as:\nDo not go barefoot; There are no obstacles in the house; Check the temperature of the bathtub or dishwater with your elbow, not your hand or foot.; Install handrails in the bathtub or shower.; Use anti-slip bath mats.; Do not stay in one position for too long. Instead, the patient should stand up and walk around a few times every hour.\nOver-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen can help control moderate pain caused by peripheral neuropathy.\n\nPreventive measures for peripheral neuropathy\nThe best way to prevent peripheral neuropathy is to control its causes, such as diabetes, alcoholism or rheumatoid arthritis. Besides, people need to practice a healthy lifestyle including:\nEat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins to keep the nerves healthy.; Fight vitamin B-12 deficiency by eating meat, fish, eggs, low-fat dairy foods, and fortified cereals. If you are vegetarian or vegan, fortified cereals are a good source of vitamin B-12, but you can also talk to your doctor about taking vitamin B-12 pills.; Exercise regularly, at least 30 minutes - 1 hour/each session and exercise at least 3 times/week.; Avoid factors that can cause nerve damage, including repetitive movements, cramped positions that put pressure on the nerves, exposure to toxic chemicals, smoking, and drinking too much alcohol.\n\nFrequently asked questions about peripheral neuropathy\n1. Is it okay to delay treatment for peripheral neuropathy?\nPeripheral neuropathy can worsen over time if left untreated, such as causing muscle atrophy, irreversible limb weakness, and reduced or loss of sensation in the skin areas that the peripheral nerves control. When 85% of the nerves have been damaged, it is very difficult to treat effectively and the chance of recovery is almost zero. Therefore, as soon as patients notice suspicious symptoms, they should go to the hospital for examination. for early diagnosis and treatment.\n2. Why do pain symptoms appear for a while and then disappear on their own?\nSome acute neurological diseases have symptoms that suddenly appear and then disappear. But after a while, the pain may return with more severe symptoms. This type of neuropathy is called chronic insidious progressive polyneuropathy. Sometimes, patients who increase their activity level will experience more burning.\n3. How can I control the burning sensation in my feet and legs?\nMany patients find relief from burning pain by using topical creams or Lidocaine patches.\nPeripheral neuropathy can cause serious complications that affect appearance and long-term health, especially in people with diabetes. If treated properly, as well as well-managed risk factors/conditions, the patient will have a chance to recover and avoid unfortunate complications such as amputation in neurological diseases. Peripheral due to diabetes. For healthy people, in addition to practicing a healthy lifestyle, eating and living, you should have regular health check-ups to screen and help detect and treat diseases early.\nDepartment of Neurology, Tam Anh General Hospital is a reputable unit for examining and treating neurological diseases, including facial paralysis.
