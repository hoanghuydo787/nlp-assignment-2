    "content": "Inguinal hernia – causes and treatments\n\nAbdominal wall hernia is a common disease, with a rate of 1.7% in all ages and 4% in people over 45 years old. Inguinal hernias account for 75% of abdominal wall hernias, with a lifetime risk of 27% in men and 3% in women. Although not as common as other digestive diseases, inguinal hernia causes many complicated problems if not detected early and treated promptly. Many patients are afraid to go to the doctor until there are complications due to disease in sensitive areas. Strangulated inguinal hernia not only makes surgery more difficult and has a high risk of recurrence, but the patient is also at risk of death from organ necrosis and infection, so people should not be subjective or underestimate it. , BS.CK II Nguyen Quoc Thai - Center for Endoscopy & Laparoscopic Surgery, Tam Anh General Hospital recommends.\n\nWhat is an inguinal hernia?\nInguinal hernia is a condition in which an abdominal organ (omentum, intestines, etc.) is no longer in its usual position but protrudes from a weak spot on the abdominal wall in the groin area. Inguinal hernia can cause life-threatening complications when there is a condition of \"strangulation\", meaning the herniated organs cannot return into the abdominal cavity, causing edema leading to lack of blood supply, necrosis and infection. (first)\nInguinal hernia occurs more often in men than in women\n\nCauses of inguinal hernia\nBabies can get an inguinal hernia if a structure called the peritoneal duct doesn't close completely, forming a weak spot in the abdominal wall. According to medical literature, about 2% - 3% of male newborns have inguinal hernia while female newborns only account for less than 1%. Older people often have direct inguinal hernias because the fascia in the abdominal wall weakens as they age.\nIn addition, some factors increase the risk of inguinal hernia such as genetics, male gender, chronic cough or constipation, smoking, pregnant women, premature babies, trauma to the groin area - Doctor Thai said.\nInguinal hernia can cause many dangerous complications\n\nSymptoms of inguinal hernia\nPatients may experience signs such as the appearance of bulges in the groin area, increasing in size when standing for a long time, coughing, or straining to defecate and often disappear when lying down. Along with that, you may feel pain when coughing, exercising or bending over; burning sensation, sharp pain, feeling of heaviness or fullness in the groin; scrotal swelling in men...(2)\nHowever, these symptoms may be similar to symptoms of some genital diseases such as testicular torsion, hydrocele... Therefore, it is important that the patient goes to the hospital for examination and treatment. Correct diagnosis and treatment of the condition encountered - Doctor Thai advised.\n\nHow to diagnose an inguinal hernia?\nThe first method of diagnosing an inguinal hernia is a clinical examination when the patient is in a standing position and coughs or pushes. At this time, the doctor can see a bulging mass in the groin area and use his fingers to do tests to determine whether it is a hernia.\nIn unclear clinical cases, the doctor may prescribe supporting means such as ultrasound, CT or MRI for diagnosis. While performing these measures, the patient can push to make the hernia appear more clearly.\nYour doctor may do an ultrasound to detect an inguinal hernia\n\nComplications of inguinal hernia\nMild cases of inguinal hernia can cause pain in the groin area when standing for a long time, when coughing, straining, exerting... affecting activities, psychology and reducing quality of life. Patients may limit physical activity due to pain during exertion, affecting general health.\nIf left untreated for a long time, the herniated organs often protrude out and stick to the surrounding tissue, unable to return to the abdomen, called an incarcerated hernia. At this time, the patient will be more uncomfortable and at risk of injury to herniated organs.(4)\nIn some cases, patients have complications of strangulation, meaning the herniated organs cannot return into the abdominal cavity, causing edema leading to lack of blood supply, necrosis and infection. If the herniated organ is the intestine, it can cause intestinal obstruction, manifested by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, inability to smell and defecate. If surgery is not performed promptly within 4-6 hours after onset, the intestine may become necrotic, endangering the patient's life, and surgical treatment will also be more complicated, requiring section of intestine to be removed, and may not be possible. Mesh can be placed to reinforce the groin area, thereby increasing the risk of recurrence - said Dr. Thai.\n\nTreatment of inguinal hernia\nCurrently, surgery is still the main treatment method for inguinal hernia. This is a very common surgery and is highly effective for patients if performed by a highly skilled doctor. Doctors may prescribe open or laparoscopic surgery depending on each specific situation.(3)\nOpen surgery: The doctor will use a surgical knife to make a large incision in the groin area to return the organs to their position in the abdomen and reinforce the abdominal wall in the groin area with fascia or artificial mesh depending on the situation. This is a traditional surgical method, which can be performed under anesthesia or sedation.\nLaparoscopic surgery: The doctor will make some small incisions in the abdomen to use a scope with a camera at the end and specialized tools to strengthen the groin area. This method is highly appreciated for its less invasive advantages, small scars and quick recovery. However, laparoscopic surgery depends heavily on machines and surgeon skills, so patients need to find reputable hospitals with modern equipment and experienced doctors to ensure safety. for surgery and post-operative recovery.\n\nPrevention of inguinal hernia\nDoctor Thai shared that inguinal hernia has genetic factors, age, gender factors, and certain diseases such as prolonged cough, chronic constipation... People can prevent it by building a diet rich in fiber, green vegetables, fruits, drinking 2 liters of water a day, avoiding constipation; Avoid alcohol, tobacco, and stimulants; Avoid activities that cause great pressure on the abdominal area... In addition, people should go to the hospital for regular health checks and specialist examinations early when they have suspicious symptoms.\nA diet rich in green vegetables and fiber helps prevent inguinal hernia\n\nQuestions related to inguinal hernia\n1. Is inguinal hernia dangerous?\nInguinal hernia is a benign disease that only causes discomfort to the patient. However, the disease often develops over time and if not treated early, it can cause complications such as strangulation of the hernia, blocking blood circulation, leading to intestinal necrosis, peritonitis...

Is inguinal hernia a congenital disease?\nInguinal hernia comes from many causes, of which genetics (congenital) is a factor. If a baby is born with an inguinal hernia, it is considered a congenital inguinal hernia.\n5. In which hospital is inguinal hernia surgery performed? How much does inguinal hernia surgery cost?\nTam Anh Hospital is a reputable unit for examining and treating digestive diseases, including inguinal hernia. With a team of leading, experienced experts and doctors, equipped with top modern machinery and medical equipment systems. In particular, the Gastrointestinal Endoscopy & Surgery Center is the first place in Southeast Asia to apply mechanical hand-held robotic tools combined with the ICG Rubina 3D/4K endoscopic surgery system in endoscopic surgery. Treatment of gastrointestinal diseases is highly effective and reduces costs for patients.\nTo learn about inguinal hernia or schedule an examination and treatment, people can contact Tam Anh General Hospital System: Hanoi: 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Bo De Ward, Long Bien District, Hanoi City Make an appointment: 024 3872 3872 - 024 7106 6858 Ho Chi Minh City: 2B Pho Quang, Ward 2, Tan Binh District, Ho Chi Minh City Make an appointment: 0287 102 6789 - 093 180 6858 Fanpage: Tam Anh General Hospital Website: https://tamanhhospital.vn\nInguinal hernia seems to be uncommon in the awareness of the disease among the majority of people, so not many people know that this disease has many potential serious complications.
