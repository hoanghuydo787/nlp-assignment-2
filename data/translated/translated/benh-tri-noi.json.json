    "content": "Internal hemorrhoids: Signs, causes, treatment, what to eat and what to avoid?\n\nHemorrhoids are one of the most common anorectal conditions in our country but have not received proper attention from people. In particular, internal hemorrhoids cause a lot of trouble for patients but are difficult to recognize, so treatment often falls into the late stages, causing costly and ineffective results. Understanding whether internal hemorrhoids are contagious, bleeding internal hemorrhoids, and whether they are hereditary helps prevent, diagnose, and treat effectively, promptly, and at a low cost - MSc. Nguyen Van Hau, Trung Center for Endoscopy & Gastrointestinal Surgery, Tam Anh General Hospital said.\nInternal hemorrhoids cause a lot of trouble for patients but are very difficult to recognize\n\nWhat are internal hemorrhoids?\nInternal hemorrhoids are a medical condition caused by veins in the anorectal area (above the dentate line) being swollen/bulging due to excessive elasticity and can cause a number of uncomfortable problems, even if the patient the disease does not feel them. Internal hemorrhoids form near the end of the rectum and cannot be seen or felt by the patient, unless they prolapse.\nInternal hemorrhoids can be more difficult to diagnose than external hemorrhoids because the hemorrhoids are hidden inside the rectum. In men, due to strong pelvic floor muscles, internal hemorrhoids rarely prolapse, so patients only come to the doctor when there are bleeding complications. Anyone can get internal hemorrhoids, but it is most common in people between 28 and 50 years old. (2)\n\nClassification of internal hemorrhoids\nNot all internal hemorrhoids are the same or cause the same problems. Doctors classify internal hemorrhoids according to the following four levels of severity:\nGrade 1 internal hemorrhoids: If the internal hemorrhoids bleed but remain inside the rectum, it is classified as grade I hemorrhoids; Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids: If the internal hemorrhoids bleed but remain inside the rectum, it is classified as grade I hemorrhoids.\nGrade 2 internal hemorrhoids: Some internal hemorrhoids will prolapse, meaning they protrude outside the anus. If the prolapsed hemorrhoids naturally reduce on their own, it is grade II hemorrhoids; Grade 2 internal hemorrhoids: Some internal hemorrhoids will prolapse, meaning they protrude outside the anus. If the prolapsed hemorrhoids naturally reduce on their own, it is grade II hemorrhoids.\nGrade 3 internal hemorrhoids: Grade III hemorrhoids prolapse and do not reduce on their own. However, these hemorrhoids often respond to manual reduction, meaning they can be pushed back into the rectum.; Grade 3 internal hemorrhoids: Grade III hemorrhoids prolapse and do not reduce on their own. However, these hemorrhoids often respond to manual reduction, meaning they can be pushed back into the rectum.\nGrade 4 internal hemorrhoids: Grade IV hemorrhoids are the most severe stage of internal hemorrhoids and cannot be cured. Hemorrhoids prolapse even when the patient has tried to reduce them manually.; Grade 4 internal hemorrhoids: Grade IV hemorrhoids are the most severe stage of internal hemorrhoids and cannot be cured. Hemorrhoids prolapse even when the patient has tried to reduce them manually.\n\nCauses of internal hemorrhoids\nIn some cases, hemorrhoids can be an unavoidable problem because it is related to the aging process due to lack of collagen in the anorectal tissue, causing dilation of hemorrhoidal blood vessels, hemorrhoidal suspensory ligaments, and stromal tissue. Hemorrhoids can develop at any time when there is additional pressure on the rectum. Some common causes of internal hemorrhoids may include:\nConstipation and diarrhea: These conditions both cause pressure on the rectal area, either by pushing too hard in the case of constipation or by frequent bowel movements in the case of diarrhea. Diarrhea and constipation can often be treated with changes in diet and lifestyle, but are associated with other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). need to see a specialist.; Constipation and diarrhea: These conditions both cause pressure on the rectal area, either by pushing too hard in the case of constipation or by frequent bowel movements in the case of diarrhea. Diarrhea and constipation can often be treated with changes in diet and lifestyle, but are associated with other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). need to see a specialist.\nPregnancy and childbirth: Many women suffer from hemorrhoids during pregnancy, because the developing fetus can cause pressure on the veins. In addition, stress during childbirth can also lead to hemorrhoids; Pregnancy and childbirth: Many women suffer from hemorrhoids during pregnancy, because the developing fetus can cause pressure on the veins. In addition, stress during childbirth can also lead to hemorrhoids.\nObesity: Obese people are at increased risk of both internal and external hemorrhoids because of increased pressure around the rectum and because obesity can be linked to poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle.; Obesity: Obese people are at increased risk of both internal and external hemorrhoids because of increased pressure around the rectum and because obesity can be linked to poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle.\nSitting for long periods of time: Sitting for long periods of time can cause undue stress to the rectal area. That's why regular activity is important to prevent hemorrhoids and other anorectal health problems.; Sitting for long periods of time: Sitting for long periods of time can cause undue stress to the rectal area. Therefore, regular activity is an important factor in preventing hemorrhoids and other anorectal health problems.\n\nSymptoms of internal hemorrhoids\nSigns of internal hemorrhoids vary depending on the severity of each stage of the disease. Even more severe internal hemorrhoids usually do not cause pain due to the lack of nerve endings in the lower rectal area. If pain occurs, it is usually caused by a related condition, such as anal fissures or external hemorrhoids.\nIn most cases, the manifestation of internal hemorrhoids is usually bleeding. Patients may see bright red blood in stools or on toilet paper when wiping. However, if there is only light bleeding, it will be difficult for the patient to recognize this condition.\nWhile bleeding is the most common sign of internal hemorrhoids, you may also experience other symptoms if the hemorrhoids prolapse. This often happens during bowel movements and in many cases, the hemorrhoid will retract on its own or the patient may have to push it back in with their hands. In the case of level IV hemorrhoids, hemorrhoidal tissue still prolapses despite manual intervention.\nIt is important to note that bleeding symptoms are common in both colorectal cancer and internal hemorrhoids. Therefore, patients should go to the hospital for examination and diagnosis if they have rectal bleeding, especially when this symptom is accompanied by other suspicious signs.\nHemorrhoids that prolapse outside the anus can cause discomfort because of itching and swelling. Some people even get dirty due to prolapsed tissue. It is difficult to know whether a person has prolapsed hemorrhoids or external hemorrhoids without a professional diagnosis from a doctor because the symptoms of these conditions are similar. In addition, patients can also have both external hemorrhoids and prolapsed hemorrhoids at the same time.(3)\n\nDiagnosis of internal hemorrhoids\nYour doctor can diagnose internal hemorrhoids by:\nVisual examination: The doctor wears specialized gloves and applies lubricant. Then, the doctor will insert a finger into the patient's rectum to check for the presence of hemorrhoids, muscle tone as well as other problems.; Visual examination: The doctor wears specialized gloves and applies lubricant. The doctor will then insert a finger into the patient's rectum to check for the presence of hemorrhoids, muscle tone, and other problems.\nRectal examination by endoscopy: The doctor will insert a flexible endoscope with a camera at the end through the anus to examine the rectum. The camera will display images of the rectum on the screen, thereby helping doctors diagnose internal hemorrhoids.; Rectal examination by endoscopy: The doctor will insert a flexible endoscope with a camera at the end through the anus to examine the rectum. The camera will display images of the rectum on the screen, thereby helping doctors diagnose internal hemorrhoids.\nEndoscopy helps doctors diagnose internal hemorrhoids\n\nHow to treat internal hemorrhoids?\nThere are many options for treating internal hemorrhoids. Among them, methods to relieve pain, itching or discomfort include topical baths, over-the-counter creams and ointments, or natural home remedies such as applying aloe vera, apple cider vinegar, and soaking the anus in warm water. … very popular.\nHowever, these treatments only provide temporary results. Internal hemorrhoid treatment should aim to solve the long-term problem by actually removing the internal hemorrhoids. Therefore, the following treatment methods will be more feasible for people with this type of hemorrhoids.\n1. Coagulation\nA less invasive option than surgery is infrared coagulation (IRC) to treat internal hemorrhoids. This method is performed by the doctor shining infrared light inside the hemorrhoid. The heat of infrared rays will cause scar tissue to form, cutting off blood flow to the hemorrhoids. About a week later, the dead tissue will fall out of the anus and there is a chance that the wound will bleed slightly.\nCompared to the rubber band ligation procedure, this method has a higher recurrence rate.\n2. Sclerotherapy\nAnother minimally invasive treatment option is sclerotherapy. This method is performed by the doctor injecting a chemical solution into the swollen veins in the rectum, damaging the veins and causing them to shrink. This procedure may need to be repeated several times to ensure the hemorrhoids are eliminated. Sclerotherapy is most effective for mild, less progressive internal hemorrhoids.\nThe Anorectal Unit of Tam Anh General Hospital has strengths in performing endoscopic hemorrhoid sclerotherapy with the advantage of very little pain, only needing one injection, very short hospital stay, and returning home the same day. , quick recovery, low treatment costs, advantages in cases of bleeding hemorrhoids, hemorrhoids that do not prolapse much, hemorrhoids that are not too big, hemorrhoids with underlying diseases that require anticoagulants, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes...\n3. Ligation of hemorrhoids using the CRH O'Regan method\nThis is one of the best ways to get rid of internal hemorrhoids and prevent their recurrence. Hemorrhoid ligation with CRH O'Regan is a great alternative to other hemorrhoid ligation methods. Instead of using metal clamps, this method uses a small disposable connector that applies gentle suction. This method requires no preparation or use of sedatives, is painless, and causes no discomfort after the procedure. However, this method is not currently popular.(1)\n4. Ligation of hemorrhoids\nHemorrhoid ligation is one of the less invasive methods. This procedure works by cutting off blood flow to the hemorrhoids, killing the tissue and leaving scar tissue. This scar tissue helps prevent hemorrhoids from recurring.\nThis procedure is performed by the doctor tying the internal hemorrhoids with rubber bands and holding them in place with metal clips to cut off blood circulation to the hemorrhoidal tissues. This method can be painful, so the patient needs a certain amount of time to recover.\n5. Surgery\nSurgical methods are invasive and can cause more pain and longer recovery times than the above procedures. Therefore, surgery should be considered a last resort if the above measures are ineffective.\nAt Tam Anh General Hospital, doctors in the Anorectal unit perform painless hemorrhoid surgery by choosing the correct surgical method (Longo, Laser, THD ultrasound...) suitable for each type of hemorrhoid. , as well as using a cold Plasmablade with less burns, less pain and faster healing.\n\nDiet for people with internal hemorrhoids\nIn addition to avoiding sitting in one place for a long time; You should move and exercise every day; Avoid activities that put pressure on the anorectal area such as lifting heavy objects; Avoid straining when defecating or delaying defecation. People with internal hemorrhoids should have a diet as follows:\n1. What should you eat if you have internal hemorrhoids?\nPeople with internal hemorrhoids and hemorrhoids in general need a diet rich in fiber, including green vegetables, fruits and whole grains (note that when adding fiber, you need soluble and insoluble fiber). You should drink 2 liters of water every day and supplement foods rich in collagen and fat.\nA diet rich in fiber helps prevent internal hemorrhoids\n2. What should you avoid eating if you have internal hemorrhoids?\nHemorrhoid patients should avoid eating hot foods that lead to constipation, such as eating too many hot fruits such as longan and lychee; Spicy, hot, acrid foods; Avoid drinking alcohol, beer, coffee, bottled soft drinks...\n\nMethods to prevent internal hemorrhoids\nThere is no specific prevention method for internal hemorrhoids, however, people can apply general prevention methods for hemorrhoids to avoid getting the disease, including:\nIncrease fiber in your diet; Drink 2 liters of water every day; Don't sit for long. If you work in an office, you should get up and walk every 30 minutes; You should not hold back your bowels; Do not sit on the toilet for a long time; Do not strain when defecating; Limit eating hot, spicy foods; Do not let constipation occur frequently or for a long time; Avoid alcoholic beverages such as wine and beer; Limit drinking bottled soft drinks; Do not have anal sex; Avoid activities that put pressure on the anorectal area such as lifting weights or heavy objects\nIn addition to the above, to prevent internal hemorrhoids and hemorrhoids in general, people should have regular health checks to be screened and detect the disease early. Early detection and timely treatment from stages 1 and 2 of internal hemorrhoids will bring greater effectiveness, faster recovery time and less cost - Dr. Hau advised.\nTam Anh Hospital is a reputable unit for examining and treating digestive diseases, including internal hemorrhoids.

            "subsection_string": "How to treat internal hemorrhoids?\nThere are many options for treating internal hemorrhoids. Among them, methods to relieve pain, itching or discomfort include topical baths, over-the-counter creams and ointments, or natural home remedies such as applying aloe vera, apple cider vinegar, and soaking the anus in warm water. … very popular.\nHowever, these treatments only provide temporary results. Internal hemorrhoid treatment should aim to solve the long-term problem by actually removing the internal hemorrhoids. Therefore, the following treatment methods will be more feasible for people with this type of hemorrhoids.\n1. Coagulation\nA less invasive option than surgery is infrared coagulation (IRC) to treat internal hemorrhoids. This method is performed by the doctor shining infrared light inside the hemorrhoid. The heat of infrared rays will cause scar tissue to form, cutting off blood flow to the hemorrhoids. About a week later, the dead tissue will fall out of the anus and there is a chance that the wound will bleed slightly.\nCompared to the rubber band ligation procedure, this method has a higher recurrence rate.\n2. Sclerotherapy\nAnother minimally invasive treatment option is sclerotherapy. This method is performed by the doctor injecting a chemical solution into the swollen veins in the rectum, damaging the veins and causing them to shrink. This procedure may need to be repeated several times to ensure the hemorrhoids are eliminated. Sclerotherapy is most effective for mild, less progressive internal hemorrhoids.\nThe Anorectal Unit of Tam Anh General Hospital has strengths in performing endoscopic hemorrhoid sclerotherapy with the advantage of very little pain, only needing one injection, very short hospital stay, and returning home the same day. , quick recovery, low treatment costs, advantages in cases of bleeding hemorrhoids, hemorrhoids that do not prolapse much, hemorrhoids that are not too big, hemorrhoids with underlying diseases that require anticoagulants, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes...\n3. Ligation of hemorrhoids using the CRH O'Regan method\nThis is one of the best ways to get rid of internal hemorrhoids and prevent their recurrence. Hemorrhoid ligation with CRH O'Regan is a great alternative to other hemorrhoid ligation methods. Instead of using metal clamps, this method uses a small disposable connector that applies gentle suction. This method requires no preparation or use of sedatives, is painless, and causes no discomfort after the procedure. However, this method is not currently popular.(1)\n4. Ligation of hemorrhoids\nHemorrhoid ligation is one of the less invasive methods. This procedure works by cutting off blood flow to the hemorrhoids, killing the tissue and leaving scar tissue. This scar tissue helps prevent hemorrhoids from recurring.\nThis procedure is performed by the doctor tying the internal hemorrhoids with rubber bands and holding them in place with metal clips to cut off blood circulation to the hemorrhoidal tissues. This method can be painful, so the patient needs a certain amount of time to recover.\n5. Surgery\nSurgical methods are invasive and can cause more pain and longer recovery times than the above procedures. Therefore, surgery should be considered a last resort if the above measures are ineffective.\nAt Tam Anh General Hospital, doctors in the Anorectal unit perform painless hemorrhoid surgery by choosing the correct surgical method (Longo, Laser, THD ultrasound...) suitable for each type of hemorrhoid. , as well as using a cold Plasmablade with less burns, less pain and faster healing."
