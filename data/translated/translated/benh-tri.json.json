    "content": "Hemorrhoids: Signs, causes, prevention, is it contagious and dangerous?\n\nHemorrhoids are very common and often occur after the age of 30, especially in people who work in the office. Because this is a disease of a sensitive area, many patients are afraid to go to the doctor until the disease is severe or there are complications - According to Dr. Nguyen Quoc Thai, Doctor of the Department of General Surgery, Center for Endoscopy and Laparoscopic Surgery. Gastroenterology, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nWhat are hemorrhoids?\nHemorrhoids (English name: hemorrhoids) are dilated veins in the anus and lower rectum, similar to varicose veins in the legs.\nHemorrhoids are very common in Vietnam with a rate of 30-50% according to research by the Vietnam Anorectal Association.\nHemorrhoids are the most common disease among colorectal diseases in our country with a rate of 35-50% - according to research by the Vietnam Anorectal Association. Hemorrhoids are not dangerous but cause a lot of trouble for patients. Therefore, a correct understanding of hemorrhoids helps prevent, completely treat and improve the quality of life for patients. Hemorrhoids can develop inside the rectum called internal hemorrhoids or under the skin around the anus called external hemorrhoids. (first)\nInternal hemorrhoids: A condition in which hemorrhoids appear above the dentate line (a serrated line, the boundary between the innermost layer (epithelium) of the anus and rectum. Because internal hemorrhoids are located inside the rectum, they are in the stage The early stages cannot be seen and are only discovered when there is blood in the bowels. When the hemorrhoids get bigger, the patient will have hemorrhoids exposed during bowel movements. Internal hemorrhoids: A condition in which hemorrhoids appear above the dentate line (a tooth-shaped line). saw, the boundary between the innermost layer (epithelium) of the anus and the rectum. Because internal hemorrhoids are located inside the rectum, in the early stages they cannot be seen and are only detected when there is blood in the stool. When hemorrhoids get bigger , when patients have bowel movements, hemorrhoids will appear.\nExternal hemorrhoids: A condition in which hemorrhoids appear below the dentate line, and below the skin of the anus. External hemorrhoids can be seen and felt and often cause more pain and discomfort than internal hemorrhoids because the damaged area is in direct contact and friction with external factors such as clothes and chairs.; External hemorrhoids: A condition in which hemorrhoids appear below the dentate line, and below the skin of the anus. External hemorrhoids can be seen and felt and often cause more pain and discomfort than internal hemorrhoids because the damaged area is in direct contact and friction with external factors such as clothes and chairs.\nBased on the progression of internal hemorrhoids, doctors can classify the levels of internal hemorrhoids as follows:\nGrade 1 hemorrhoids: At this stage, hemorrhoids are at the lightest level, the hemorrhoids are still completely located in the anal canal and have not protruded.; Grade 2 hemorrhoids: Hemorrhoids protrude out during defecation, can come back in on their own after defecation.; Grade 3 hemorrhoids: At this stage, hemorrhoids protrude out during bowel movements and need to be pushed back in with hands after bowel movements.; Grade 4 hemorrhoids: This is the stage of severe hemorrhoids, hemorrhoids often fall out even when the patient does not have a bowel movement, such as when squatting, doing heavy work or walking a lot. At this time, hemorrhoids cause many difficulties in defecation and daily activities.\n\nRisk factors for hemorrhoids\nDoctor Thai said that hemorrhoids can occur at any age but are most common in people aged 30-60 years old, among them, the proportion of women with hemorrhoids is higher than that of men (accounting for 61%).\nThe cause of hemorrhoids can stem from factors and risks such as:\nSitting a lot, not exercising, especially office workers; Drink less water; Drink beer; Or eat hot and spicy foods; Diet lacking green vegetables and fiber; Being over-weighted; Pregnant women; Chronic constipation or diarrhea; Or have anal sex; Habit of sitting on the toilet for a long time or straining a lot when defecating; Pelvic area tumors such as colorectal tumors, uterine fibroids...\n\nSigns of hemorrhoids\nPeople with hemorrhoids may exhibit the following symptoms:\nHemorrhoids prolapse outside the anus during bowel movements. When severe hemorrhoids can appear outside the anus frequently.; Hemorrhoids become clogged or prolapsed, causing swelling and pain; Defecation is bleeding but not painful. Depending on the severity of bleeding, the patient may only see blood seeping into the toilet paper, or it may be dripping or blood splattering. The more you push, the more blood will flow.; Frequent anal irritation or itching. This symptom is easily confused with symptoms of pinworm infection; Discomfort and anal burning pain gradually increase with the progression of hemorrhoids. (2)\nFrequent bleeding during defecation is one of the signs of hemorrhoids\n\nComplications of hemorrhoids\nDr. Thai shared that hemorrhoids can occur in one period or last a lifetime. There are people who have had hemorrhoids without even knowing they had the disease. Most patients only come for examination when the hemorrhoids have grown large, causing friction, bleeding, and pain. However, treating hemorrhoids in stage 4 will be much more difficult and expensive because hemorrhoids have developed many complications over time.\nThe most common complications of hemorrhoids include:\nAnemia: frequent anal bleeding can lead to chronic anemia, a decrease in red blood cell indexes in the blood. Although not life-threatening, chronic anemia leaves the patient in a state of exhaustion and physical weakness, seriously affecting the quality of life. In severe cases, the patient may need a blood transfusion or hospitalization for treatment. In particular, bleeding from hemorrhoids in men is often more serious than in women. The reason is because the anal canal in women is not deep, internal hemorrhoids come out early, helping to detect and treat them early. Meanwhile, the anal tract in men is deeper so it is difficult to detect. Once blood is passed out, the hemorrhoids are very large, lose a lot of blood and are difficult to treat.; Anemia: frequent anal bleeding can lead to chronic anemia, a decrease in red blood cell indexes in the blood.

Meanwhile, the anal tract in men is deeper so it is difficult to detect. Once blood is passed out, the hemorrhoids are very large, lose a lot of blood and are difficult to treat.\nProlapsed hemorrhoids: hemorrhoids that protrude outside the anus and cannot be retracted can cause blockage of blood vessels. The patient sees that the hemorrhoid is swollen, red, and cannot be pushed in with his hand because it is very painful. This condition can lead to complications of hemorrhoid necrosis; Prolapsed hemorrhoids: hemorrhoids that protrude outside the anus and cannot be retracted can cause blockage of blood vessels. The patient sees that the hemorrhoid is swollen, red, and cannot be pushed in with his hand because it is very painful. This condition can lead to complications of hemorrhoid necrosis.\nEmbolism: blood clots easily form in the blood vessels of hemorrhoids when blood circulation is stagnant. This complication causes pain, and the condition becomes more severe when necrosis occurs.; Embolism: blood clots easily form in the blood vessels of hemorrhoids when blood circulation is stagnant. This complication causes pain, and the condition becomes more severe when necrosis occurs.\nUlcers, infections: can cause perianal dermatitis, papillitis or slit inflammation causing itching, burning pain in the anal area. Infection occurs when there is ulceration or necrosis of the hemorrhoid, causing the wound to come into contact with feces containing large amounts of germs.

Colon: People with hemorrhoids are 2.9 times more likely to have colorectal cancer than normal people or people with other diseases; Hemorrhoid treatment helps reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by 50%.; Colorectal cancer: a large-scale 10-year (2000 - 2010) study by Taichung Medical University (Taiwan) has shown a clear relationship between hemorrhoids and colorectal cancer. Colon: People with hemorrhoids are 2.9 times more likely to have colorectal cancer than normal people or people with other diseases; Hemorrhoid treatment helps reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by 50%.\n\nWhen do people with hemorrhoids need to go to the hospital?\n“The anus is the final “gateway” of the digestive system. All residue from food will be eliminated by the body through the anus. If this last \"door\" is \"narrow\" or \"damaged\", it will affect the process of defecation, put pressure on the rectum and can cause many negative consequences for the digestive tract.\nDr. Thai advises that people should go to the hospital for examination as soon as they notice symptoms of hemorrhoids to receive advice, dietary instructions, and prescription treatment at home in case of mild hemorrhoids. For severe hemorrhoids, patients need surgery or procedures to remove hemorrhoids, and treatment with prescription drugs at the hospital.\nIn case of serious complications such as causing bleeding in streaks, signs of necrosis in the anus, anal irritation, pain, burning, difficulty in daily activities, the patient must immediately go to the hospital for timely intervention by a doctor. Patients absolutely must not continue self-treatment at home because it can be life-threatening.\nWatch more detailed advice videos about hemorrhoids by Dr. Nguyen Van Hau\n\nMethods of treating hemorrhoids\nPatients can be prescribed by a doctor or choose a hemorrhoid treatment method as suggested by the doctor as follows:\n1. Treatment methods commonly used in hospitals\nRubber band ligation: the doctor uses a rubber band to tie the base of the hemorrhoid. After 1 week, the hemorrhoid will dry and fall out of the anus. This procedure only applies to mild hemorrhoids.; Rubber band ligation: the doctor uses a rubber band to tie the base of the hemorrhoid. After 1 week, the hemorrhoid will dry and fall out of the anus. This procedure only applies to mild hemorrhoids.\nSclerotherapy: the doctor will inject chemicals into the hemorrhoid tissue to shrink the hemorrhoid; Sclerotherapy: the doctor will inject chemicals into the hemorrhoid tissue to shrink the hemorrhoids.\nLongo surgical method: The surgeon cuts and hangs the hemorrhoid with a specialized machine. This surgery has little pain and quick recovery time.; Longo surgical method: The surgeon cuts and hangs the hemorrhoid with a specialized machine. This surgery is less painful and has a quick recovery time.\nClassic hemorrhoidectomy surgery: Often used for cases of mixed hemorrhoids (both internal and external hemorrhoids) or patients with excess skin, hemorrhoids with complications of thrombosis and strangulation. This method creates a wound in the anal area, which takes several weeks to heal completely and causes pain. However, currently it is possible to use an ultrasonic knife to cut hemorrhoids to limit tissue simulation and post-operative pain.

However, currently it is possible to use an ultrasonic knife to cut hemorrhoids to limit tissue simulation and post-operative pain. (4)\nHemorrhoidectomy surgery is one of the most popular hemorrhoid treatment methods today\n2. How to treat hemorrhoids at home\nEat foods rich in fiber. Eat lots of fruits, vegetables and whole grains; Use topical medication or medicine to improve blood circulation; Regularly soak your anus in warm water for 10-15 minutes each time, 2-3 times a day.; Avoid heavy exercise, sitting or standing for long periods of time; You can take pain relievers acetaminophen, aspirin or ibuprofen with your doctor's approval.\n\nInstructions on how to prevent hemorrhoids\n“The rate of people with hemorrhoids in Vietnam is increasing today, largely due to diet and the habit of sitting a lot and being sedentary. To prevent hemorrhoids, people should pay attention to eating scientifically with a diet rich in fiber, drinking 2-3 liters of water per day; Limit spicy and hot foods, alcohol and coffee; Limit sitting for too long, instead get up and walk every 30 minutes if you work in an office; maintain exercise and sports habits; Don't wear pants that are too tight; Don't let constipation last for a long time, especially pregnant women\" - Dr. Thai advised.\nTo learn about hemorrhoids, what should you eat and avoid? In addition to taking hemorrhoid treatment measures, you need to combine it with diet and abstain from a few things so that the disease can improve.\n\nFrequently asked questions about hemorrhoids\nDoctor Thai shared: \"During the examination and treatment process, we encountered many questions from people about hemorrhoids. I would like to answer each specific question as follows:\n1. Does hemorrhoids affect fertility?\nPlease answer, hemorrhoids are a digestive disease so they do not affect fertility.\n2. Are hemorrhoids contagious?\nAre hemorrhoids contagious? Hemorrhoids are not caused by infectious bacteria or viruses, so this is not a contagious disease.\n3. Are hemorrhoids dangerous?\nHemorrhoids are a benign disease, but if not treated promptly, they can lead to serious complications. For example, complications of necrotic hemorrhoids, if not treated early, can cause widespread infection in the anal area and cause bloodstream infection.\n4. Are hemorrhoids hereditary?\nHemorrhoids are not hereditary, but a family may tend to have hemorrhoids due to similar eating and living habits.\n5. If you have hemorrhoids, should you abstain from sex?\nPeople with hemorrhoids can still have normal sexual activities, but you need to avoid anal sex or limit sexual positions that put pressure on the anus.\n6. Where to get examined for hemorrhoids?\nNowadays there are many hemorrhoid clinics and hospitals that people can visit. However, it is best to go to clinics with qualified and experienced doctors to receive diagnosis and advice on effective treatment to avoid complications. In particular, if the hospital has modern equipment, the better, because scientific and advanced machines will support better treatment, shorten hospital stay, reduce treatment costs and heal wounds faster.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of hemorrhoids with experienced experts of Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact: Tam Anh General Hospital System: Hanoi: 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Ward Bo De, Long Bien District, Hanoi City Hotline: 024 3872 3872 – 024 7106 6858“>024 3872 3872 – 024 7106 6858 HCMC: 2B Pho Quang, Ward 2, Tan Binh District, HCMC Hotline: 0287 102 6789 – 093 180 6858“>0287 102 6789 – 093 180 6858 Fanpage: Tam Anh General Hospital Website: https://tamanhhospital.vn\nIn short, hemorrhoids are a benign digestive disease but can cause serious complications if the disease lasts long and is not treated properly. People should proactively prevent hemorrhoids by following a scientific diet, lifestyle and exercise; Proactive examination to detect hemorrhoids early makes the treatment process easier and has a high chance of recovery, saving hemorrhoid treatment costs and time.",
