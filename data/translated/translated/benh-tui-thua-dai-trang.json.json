    "content": "Colon diverticulosis: Causes, prevention, treatment\n\nColon diverticulosis is very common and becomes serious when the diverticula have complications such as inflammation, bleeding, or perforation. Patients will experience symptoms of severe abdominal pain, fever, diarrhea, and bloody stools - MSc. Ngo Hoang Kien Tam said.\n\nDiverticulitis of the colon\nWhat are colonic diverticula: Diverticula are small, bulging sacs that protrude outside the colon wall. Diverticula can occur anywhere in the colon but most commonly near the end of the colon on the left side (iliac colon). Diverticulosis is common, especially after age 40; What is colon diverticulitis: Diverticulitis is a condition in which diverticula become infected and the tissues surrounding the diverticula become swollen. Diverticulitis can progress and cause complications such as discharge, perforation, severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea, diarrhea, and bloody stools.\nDiverticulitis usually occurs in people over the age of 40\nMild diverticulitis can be treated with dietary changes such as eating high-fiber foods, taking antispasmodic medications or antibiotics. In cases of severe diverticulitis causing complications or recurrence, the patient may need surgery.\n\nSymptoms of diverticulitis\nMost patients with colonic diverticulosis have no symptoms. About 20% of patients have some symptoms:\nSevere abdominal pain with fever (when diverticula are punctured); Abdominal bloating, flatulence; Nausea and vomiting; Constipation or diarrhea; Hematocele (when the diverticula bleed); Urinating feces and gas (when diverticula are inflamed for a long time, causing bladder-colon fistula)\n\nCauses of diverticular disease and diverticulitis\nThe theory accepted by most experts as to why diverticula form is due to increased pressure within the colon, due to a low-fiber diet causing weak areas of the colon wall to protrude and form pouches. redundant.\nDiverticulitis occurs when diverticula tear, leading to inflammation and in some cases, infection.\n\nFactors that increase the risk of diverticulitis\nSome factors can increase the risk of developing diverticulitis such as:\nOlder age; Sedentary; Low-fiber diet; Certain medications such as antihypertensives, diuretics, and narcotic pain relievers can increase constipation and increase pressure within the colon. Any factor that increases pressure can lead to the formation of multiple diverticula.\n\nComplications of diverticulitis\nDoctor Kien Tam said that complications often occur when acute diverticulitis occurs. About 25% of people with acute diverticulitis develop complications. Complications of diverticula include bleeding, narrowing of the colon that makes it difficult for stool to pass, and formation of a connection to another organ or skin (called a fistula). If there is a fistula, it is usually a fistula from the colon to the bladder or it can also be a fistula from the colon to the skin, fallopian tube, vagina or another part of the intestine.\nIn addition, other complications may appear such as:\nPelvic abscess due to diverticular rupture.; Peritonitis can occur if the diverticula become severely inflamed, the diverticula ruptures, causing intestinal fluid and feces to spill into the abdominal cavity. Peritonitis often requires emergency surgery.\n\nHow is diverticulitis diagnosed?\nColonic diverticula usually do not cause symptoms and are often discovered during a colonoscopy. The disease can also be diagnosed with an abdominopelvic CT scan or contrast-enhanced colon X-ray. During an episode of acute diverticulitis, a CT scan may be used to diagnose the extent of the infection.\n\nTreatment methods for diverticulitis\nPatients with asymptomatic diverticular disease are advised to eat a high-fiber diet. Most cases of diverticulitis can be treated with antibiotics. Diverticulitis with abscess complications can be treated with antibiotics and drainage.\nSurgery for diverticular disease is indicated in the following situations:\nRupture of diverticulitis leads to pus and feces flowing into the abdominal cavity, causing peritonitis. The disease is often severe and requires emergency surgery; Abscess drainage is not effective.; Severe cases of diverticulitis unresponsive to medical treatment; Intensive treatment is necessary in patients with immunodeficiency such as patients after organ transplantation or chemotherapy.; Diverticulitis causes colonic stricture or fistula; Patients with multiple episodes of recurrent inflammation may benefit from surgery as a strategy to prevent recurrence. The goal of surgery is to resolve the infection: diverticulectomy, colon resection, abscess drainage, abdominal washing... The current world trend is laparoscopic surgery. The outstanding advantages of laparoscopic surgery compared to open surgery are less pain, reduced wound infection rate, and faster recovery time.\nLaparoscopic surgery is a popular treatment method today\nHome care if diverticulitis\nPatients need to rest, rest, eat liquid food, and avoid strenuous exercise. Usually after a few days the symptoms will improve, the patient can eat more fiber-rich foods such as whole grains, vegetables, and fruits.\n\nPreventive measures for diverticulitis\nOnce diverticula are formed they are permanent, so there is no treatment to prevent diverticulosis. However, we can prevent further diverticula from forming or getting worse with measures including:\nExercise regularly: Exercise helps promote normal bowel function and reduces pressure inside the colon. Therefore, doctors advise that each person should try to exercise at least 30 minutes a day to exercise and prevent diverticulitis as well as many other diseases.; Eat lots of fiber: A high-fiber diet reduces the risk of diverticulitis. Therefore, you should eat lots of fiber-rich foods such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to soften the waste and help it pass through the large intestine faster.; Drink plenty of water: Contributes to preventing constipation; Avoid smoking: Research has shown that smoking is associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis.; Do not delay defecation: Holding in defecation causes the stool to become dry and clogged, increasing pressure in the large intestine, causing the risk of diverticulosis.\nDiverticulitis can lead to many serious complications that threaten the patient's health and life. Therefore, we should prevent and have regular medical examinations specializing in gastroenterology to detect diseases early and treat them, avoiding unfortunate risks - MSc.
