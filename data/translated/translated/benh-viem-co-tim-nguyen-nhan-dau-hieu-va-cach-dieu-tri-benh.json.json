    "content": "Myocarditis: Causes, signs and treatments\n\nRecently, social networks spread information about a dangerous virus epidemic in Hanoi causing myocarditis, killing 2 people, and could quickly spread into an epidemic. However, experts have confirmed that the above information is completely false and is just unfounded rumors.\n The Central Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Ministry of Health, determined that 2 patients died from acute myocarditis, separately, without causing an epidemic in the community. Specifically, before that, these two patients were completely healthy and worked in two different departments, did not know each other and had never had contact with each other. Acquaintances living next to these two patients are also completely healthy. Both female patients have never been abroad, and have not had contact with sick people, fever, or foreigners.\n So what is myocarditis, what causes it, what are the symptoms, and how to treat and prevent it?\n\n1.What is myocarditis?\nMyocarditis is an inflammation of all or part of the heart muscle, which is the result of another infection, not a separate virus called myocarditis virus.\nThe disease can occur at any age but is more common in young people (20 - 40 years old), more common in men than women, and the manifestations can range from mild to severe. People with weakened immune systems, infants and young children are often at greater risk.\nMyocarditis manifests in many different degrees. In particular, the fulminant form is characterized by acute onset and severe circulatory collapse, with a very high risk of death of up to 70% if not promptly treated actively.\n\n2. What are the symptoms of myocarditis?\nExperts say that myocarditis has very diverse manifestations, but the disease can be divided into the following 3 main groups:\nAsymptomatic group: Some cases have myocarditis but the symptoms are unclear, or even no symptoms at all, making it difficult for patients to detect changes in the body. From then on, the disease progresses silently, and by the time it is detected, the disease has become serious and the heart muscle can become enlarged.\nPeople with myocarditis have symptoms of chest pain.\nGroup with typical symptoms: Some subjects show unusual and very typical changes. In the initial stage, there are high fever, headache, muscle fatigue, watery eyes, runny nose, diarrhea, difficulty breathing and poor appetite. This condition causes difficulty breathing and may increase after 1 or 2 days, accompanied by chest pain, palpitations and pain in the liver area.\nGroup with serious symptoms: Patients with cardiogenic shock, small rapid pulse, low or unmeasured blood pressure, and pale skin. Symptoms gradually worsen, patients do not respond to treatment and can easily lead to death.\n\n3. Is myocarditis dangerous?\nMyocarditis can cause a series of serious complications for patients:\nHeart failure:\nIf not detected and treated promptly, myocarditis can quickly damage the heart muscle and lead to heart failure, causing the heart to no longer pump blood to feed the body. Myocardial infarction or stroke: Damage to the heart muscle will cause blood flowing in the heart to form blood clots and these blood clots can block one of the coronary arteries. This will lead to a heart attack. In case the blood clot in the heart moves to the artery leading to the brain, the patient will likely face a stroke.\nFast heart rate or arrhythmia:\nMyocarditis is also one of the causes of arrhythmia.\nSudden death:\nSerious arrhythmia will cause the heart to stop beating suddenly and lead to rapid death if not treated promptly. According to statistics in young people, myocarditis accounts for 20% of the causes of sudden death.\nMyocardial infarction or stroke:\nIf the heart muscle is damaged as blood flows within the heart, blood clots can form. If a blood clot blocks one of the coronary arteries, it causes a heart attack. Or if a blood clot in the heart travels to an artery leading to the brain, it can cause a stroke.\n\n4. List the \"culprits\" that can cause myocarditis\nBelow are some \"culprits\" that can cause myocarditis:\nViral myocarditis:\nSome types of common flu can also cause myocarditis. In addition, hepatitis B and C viruses, herpes viruses, gastrointestinal infections, mononucleosis or Rubella can also cause myocarditis.\nBacterial myocarditis:\nBacteria such as staphylococcus, streptococcus, and bacilli cause diphtheria; caused by parasites such as Trypanosoma cruzi and toxoplasma, including some species that are transmitted by insects and can cause “Chagas” disease… which are some bacteria that are believed to cause myocarditis.\nFungal myocarditis: Candida; aspergillus and certain fungi found in bird droppings, such as Histoplasma, are thought to be associated with myocarditis. People with weak immune systems who are infected with one of these fungi have a higher risk of getting sick.\nIn addition, patients who must use certain specific medications may experience drug allergic reactions or some unwanted side effects that can also cause myocarditis, such as the drugs used. for cancer treatment; antibiotics (such as penicillins and sulfonamides); some anti-epileptic drugs and some illegal substances such as cocaine.\nIn some cases, having to live in a toxic environment and being exposed to many chemicals, the risk of myocarditis is also higher than other people.\nIn autoimmune causes, the body's immune system attacks healthy heart muscle tissue, not bacteria.\n\n5. Method of diagnosing myocarditis\nTo diagnose myocarditis, in addition to the above clinical symptoms, doctors will perform a number of additional tests to reach the most accurate conclusion:\nECG;; Echocardiography;; Cardiopulmonary X-ray;; Test cardiac enzyme levels and anti-viral antibodies;; Myocardial biopsy…\n\n6. Treatment methods\nDepending on the cause and the patient's condition, the doctor will prescribe separate treatment regimens. But the current popular treatment method for myocarditis is still symptomatic treatment. Some main ways to treat symptoms are to strengthen myocardial contractility, prevent arrhythmia and prevent shock, etc.\nPatients need to use medication as prescribed by their doctor\nDrug treatment: Patients can only use drugs as prescribed by their doctor. In case the patient has heart failure, digoxin and diuretics can be used. In cases of cardiac dysfunction, doctors will assist by using inotropes in the acute phase. The patient will then be treated with an ACE inhibitor as tolerated.\nFor severe cases where the heart cannot respond to conventional therapies and has difficulty returning to normal function, doctors will choose extracorporeal circulation therapy or can be understood as is a method of supporting heart function with an extracorporeal oxygen exchange membrane device (ECMO) or heart transplant for patients who cannot improve heart function.\nCurrently, there is no specific prevention method for myocarditis, but experts recommend that you practice good hygiene to avoid the risk of myocarditis and limit the risk of disease. Besides, limit contact with insects, get vaccinated against some diseases that have the risk of causing myocarditis such as rubella and influenza.\nPlease note that if you experience symptoms such as chest pain and difficulty breathing, or signs of infection or viral infection, you should immediately go to a reputable medical facility for timely examination and treatment.\nMyocarditis treatment at Tam Anh General Hospital System Heart Center, Tam Anh General Hospital System is considered by experts to be one of the prestigious cardiovascular specialist centers, gathering a team of good doctors with rich expertise.
