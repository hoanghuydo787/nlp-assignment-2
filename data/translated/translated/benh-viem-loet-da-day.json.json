    "content": "Gastric ulcer disease: Causes and symptoms\n\nGastric ulcers are one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases. When detected early, the disease can be easily cured, but if left untreated for a long time, the disease will progress and can lead to complications. According to Dr. Huynh Van Trung - Gastrointestinal Endoscopy & Surgery Center - Tam Anh General Hospital, stomach ulcers, especially ulcers infected with Helicobacter Pylori, increase the risk of stomach cancer. Understanding the causes, symptoms, and complications of the disease will help patients proactively examine, treat, and prevent more effectively.\n\nWhat is stomach ulcer?\nIllustration of stomach ulcer\nStomach ulcers are a condition in which the stomach lining is damaged, inflamed, and gradually forms ulcers that cause symptoms. Small ulcers in the early stages can heal on their own without treatment. However, for large ulcers that cause many symptoms, patients need to see a doctor immediately for examination and the most effective treatment plan.\n\nStages of stomach ulcers\nStomach ulcers are divided into two stages: acute and chronic ulcers.\n1. Acute gastric ulcer\nThe characteristic feature of acute gastric ulcer is that the symptoms often appear suddenly, appear clearly and progress over a short period of time. At this stage, if detected and treated properly, the disease can be completely cured. However, most patients often ignore the symptoms and do not go to the doctor, making the condition more complicated.\n2. Chronic stomach ulcers\nAcute stomach ulcers, when left untreated, will cause prolonged inflammation and, after a period of time, can turn into a chronic form. In the chronic stage, the lesions spread, the disease is more difficult to treat, and can even lead to dangerous complications such as atrophic inflammation, intestinal metaplasia, pyloric stenosis, hemorrhage, perforation, and stomach cancer. , inflammation of neighboring organs...\n\nCause of stomach ulcers\nStomach ulcers can be caused by many different causes. Among them, the two most common causes are:\n1. Helicobacter infection. pylori (HP bacteria)\nHP bacteria are the leading cause of stomach ulcers\nH.pylori infection is the leading cause of stomach ulcers. After entering the stomach, this bacteria will burrow into the mucous layer of the gastric mucosa, secreting toxins that damage the gastric mucosa, inhibiting the production of protective factors in the gastric mucosa, forming ulcers. ulcers. (first)\n2. Long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nUsing NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac... for a long time will damage the stomach. These drugs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, reducing the effectiveness of gastric mucosa protection, making the stomach susceptible to ulcers.\nBesides the above two causes, the disease can also be caused by less common causes, including:\nIncreased stomach acid secretion: This can happen for many reasons, including genetics, smoking, stress or consuming certain foods. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: This is a rare condition that causes excess acid in the stomach.; Increased stomach acid secretion: This can happen for many reasons, including genetics, smoking, stress or consuming certain foods.; Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: This is a rare condition that causes excess acid in the stomach.\n\nWho is susceptible to stomach ulcers?\nGastric ulcers can occur in anyone. However, the disease is most common in people over 50 years old. In addition, people with the following risk factors are more susceptible to this disease:\n1. Regularly smoke cigarettes and drink wine/other alcoholic beverages\nCigarettes contain many toxic substances that can weaken the stomach's protective mechanism, making this organ vulnerable to damage. Meanwhile, alcohol makes existing ulcers heal more slowly and stimulates acid secretion to create new ulcers.\n2. Often stressed and worried\nProlonged stress and anxiety can cause gastric juice to secrete continuously, greatly affecting the functioning of the stomach, increasing the risk of ulcer formation.\n3. Irregular and unscientific eating and living activities\nFrequently skipping breakfast, staying up late, eating at irregular times, lack of exercise... are bad habits that increase the risk of stomach ulcers.\n\nSymptoms of stomach ulcers\nEpigastric pain is the most common symptom of stomach ulcers\nSymptoms of stomach ulcers are very diverse. Among them, the most common symptoms are a burning, gnawing feeling and pain in the abdominal area above the navel (epigastric pain). Usually, the pain will be more intense when the stomach is empty and does not contain food. Depending on the severity of the disease, the pain can last from a few minutes to several hours.\nOther common signs and symptoms of the disease include:\nBloating, indigestion Nausea or vomiting Feeling full easily when eating or not wanting to eat because of pain Burping, heartburn or acid reflux Difficulty sleeping, not sleeping well Feeling tired, weak Having black or black stools blood Weight loss; Bloating, indigestion; Nausea or vomiting; Easily feeling full when eating or not wanting to eat because of pain; belching, heartburn or acid reflux; Difficulty sleeping, not sleeping well; Body fatigue and weakness; Black or bloody stools; Weight loss.\nIf you have any of the above symptoms, you should talk to your doctor. Symptoms may be mild at first, but if not treated promptly, they can become more severe and affect the person's life. (2)\n\nComplications of stomach ulcers\nGastric ulcers in the acute stage are not too worrying and can be completely cured with appropriate measures. But once it has entered the chronic stage, the disease is very difficult to completely cure and can cause many dangerous complications, threatening the patient's life. Possible complications of ulcers include:\nGastrointestinal bleeding: This is one of the most common complications of stomach ulcers. This condition can cause the patient to lose blood, cause dizziness, pale skin, vomiting blood or black stools. Stomach perforation: Long-term ulcers can cause the stomach to perforate, causing sudden, severe abdominal pain. Pyloric stenosis: The pylorus is located at the end of the stomach, where it connects with the duodenum. Stomach ulcers can form fibrotic tissue in this location, preventing the movement of food in the digestive system. Some common symptoms of pyloric stenosis are vomiting, old food cravings, and rapid weight loss. Stomach cancer: Gastric ulcers are one of the risk factors for the formation of malignant tumors in the stomach.; Gastrointestinal bleeding: This is one of the most common complications of stomach ulcers. This condition can cause the patient to lose blood, cause dizziness, pale skin, vomiting blood or black stools.; Stomach perforation: Long-term ulcers can cause the stomach to perforate, causing sudden, severe abdominal pain; Pyloric stenosis: The pylorus is located at the end of the stomach, where it connects with the duodenum.

Some common symptoms of pyloric stenosis are vomiting, craving for old food and rapid weight loss.; Stomach cancer: Gastric ulcers are one of the risk factors for the formation of malignant tumors in the stomach.\n\nHow to diagnose stomach ulcers?\nTo diagnose stomach ulcers, the doctor will first ask the patient about the symptoms they are experiencing and how long they have occurred. The doctor will also consider medical history and medications (prescription or non-prescription) that the patient is using.\nAfter that, the doctor may prescribe some necessary tests to determine the condition of stomach ulcers and diagnose the cause of the disease.\n1. Gastric endoscopy\nDoctors at Tam Anh General Hospital are performing a stomach endoscopy on a patient\nCurrently, gastric endoscopy is the most effective and widely applied method in diagnosing gastric ulcers. Through endoscopy, the doctor will have a visual view of the condition inside the stomach, accurately assess the disease condition and location of damage to provide the best treatment.\nFurthermore, during the endoscopy process, the doctor can intervene to stop the bleeding of stomach ulcers, and can also take a biopsy around the damaged area to preliminarily determine the status of HP infection or other problems. other doubts.\nWhat should be noted here is that HP bacteria can spread during endoscopy due to the use of common endoscopes for many different patients (although this is very rare). Therefore, patients who want to have a gastric endoscopy should go to reputable medical facilities with strict and clear infection control procedures to ensure safety and avoid infection during the endoscopy process.\n2. Test to check for other HP infections\nIn addition to gastric endoscopy, to determine whether HP bacteria exist in the patient's body or not, the doctor may prescribe a number of other tests such as:\nBlood test: to look for anti-HP antibodies Stool test Breath test.; Blood test: to find anti-HP antibodies; Stool test; Breath test.\n\nTreatment methods for stomach ulcers\nDepending on the cause of the ulcer, the doctor will choose the appropriate treatment method for the patient. It is important that patients see a doctor as soon as they experience unusual symptoms. The sooner you seek treatment, the higher your chance of recovery.(3)\n1. Medical treatment of stomach ulcers\nIf the ulcer is caused by HP infection, the doctor may prescribe treatment according to a Helicobacter pylori eradication regimen. Currently, due to the widespread problem of drug resistance, the most commonly used HP eradication regimen is a 4-drug regimen containing Bismuth or Levofloxacin.\nIn addition, patients are also required to stop using all NSAIDs (if possible) to speed up the recovery process.\nDuring treatment, patients may experience some side effects of the drug such as nausea, dizziness, headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain... These side effects are usually temporary and will disappear after the end of treatment. end of treatment. However, if you experience side effects that cause extreme discomfort, you should talk to your doctor to consider changing your treatment regimen.\nWhen treated properly, the symptoms of stomach ulcers will quickly subside. However, doctors note that patients still need to continue using the medicine according to the doctor's instructions and do not arbitrarily reduce the dose or stop taking the medicine. This is to ensure that HP bacteria are completely eliminated, preventing oiliness and drug resistance.\n2. Surgical treatment\nIn rare cases, your doctor may prescribe surgery to treat complicated stomach ulcers. That is when medical treatment does not bring positive results, the ulcer does not heal or often recurs in the same location, or when the ulcer has caused complications such as bleeding, gastric perforation, pyloric stenosis. Prevents food from going into the small intestine...\n\nHow to prevent stomach ulcers\nDeveloping a more scientific diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of developing stomach ulcers. People at high risk of stomach ulcers should add the following foods to their daily diet:(4)\nFruits and vegetables: Eating plenty of fruits and vegetables is key to improving digestive health. Vegetables and fruits are rich in antioxidants, they also contain ingredients that are anti-inflammatory, protect cells and help the stomach lining become healthy.; Fruits and vegetables: Eating plenty of fruits and vegetables is key to improving digestive health.

Recommended foods high in selenium include sea fish (mackerel, tuna, salmon...), whole grains, seeds, nuts...\nIn addition to diet, forming the following habits is also helpful in preventing stomach ulcers:\nQuit smoking, avoid alcohol and caffeine. Limit the use of Ibuprofen, aspirin and naproxen (NSAIDs) or consult your doctor about switching to other medications with similar effects. Wash your hands often with soap. and water to avoid the risk of infection Eat cooked food, drink boiled water, limit eating at restaurants Learn how to control stress.; Quit smoking, avoid alcohol and caffeine; Limit your use of Ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen (NSAIDs) or consult your doctor about switching to other medications with similar effects; Regularly wash your hands with soap and water to avoid the risk of infection; Eat cooked, drink boiled, limit eating at restaurants; Learn how to control stress.\n\nDistinguish between gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer\nThe terms “gastric ulcer” and “peptic ulcer” are sometimes used interchangeably. In fact, gastric ulcers are a \"subset\" of duodenal ulcers. Stomach ulcers are lesions that form inside the stomach, while duodenal ulcers refer to ulcers in the stomach and duodenum (the top part of the small intestine).\nLesions and ulcers have similar characteristics, differing only in their location in the digestive tract. Gastric and duodenal ulcers have a wider scope than gastric ulcers.\n\nFrequently asked questions about stomach ulcers\n1. Does stomach ulcer require surgery?\nStomach ulcers are often treated with internal medicine. However, in some rare cases, surgery may still be indicated. This is usually when medical treatment does not bring positive results or when the disease has complications that require surgical intervention.\n2. What is HP positive gastric ulcer?\nOne of the most common causes of stomach ulcers is HP infection. This type of bacteria not only causes stomach ulcers but is also the cause of many other gastrointestinal diseases, including stomach cancer. Therefore, during the diagnosis process, the doctor may ask the patient to perform tests to see if the ulcer is caused by this type of bacteria.\nThere are many methods to test for HP bacteria in the stomach such as gastroscopy, blood tests, stool tests, and breath tests. After testing, if the result is positive, it means there are HP bacteria in the stomach, and if negative, it means there are no HP bacteria in the stomach. Based on this result, the doctor will recommend a suitable treatment plan for the patient.\n3. Can ultrasound detect stomach ulcers?\nUltrasound of the stomach does not help doctors detect stomach ulcers. Currently, the most optimal method to diagnose stomach ulcers is gastric endoscopy. Thanks to the image transmitted from the endoscope's camera, the doctor can clearly observe the extent and location of the damage, and can also take a biopsy to test for HP to confirm the diagnosis.\nIt can be seen that early examination, detection and treatment of gastric ulcers play a very important role, helping the disease to be treated thoroughly and shortening recovery time, avoiding complications. Therefore, as soon as patients notice unusual symptoms, they should go to reputable medical facilities for examination and stomach endoscopy to detect ulcers.\nGastrointestinal Endoscopy and Endoscopy Surgery Center, Tam Anh General Hospital is a unit that brings together a team of experts with highly specialized knowledge, extensive experience, proficiency and mastery of new endoscopic techniques.

Test to check for other HP infections\nIn addition to gastric endoscopy, to determine whether HP bacteria exist in the patient's body or not, the doctor may prescribe a number of other tests such as:\nBlood test: to look for anti-HP antibodies Stool test Breath test.; Blood test: to find anti-HP antibodies; Stool test; Breath test."

This is usually when medical treatment does not bring positive results or when the disease has complications that require surgical intervention.\n2. What is HP positive gastric ulcer?\nOne of the most common causes of stomach ulcers is HP infection. This type of bacteria not only causes stomach ulcers but is also the cause of many other gastrointestinal diseases, including stomach cancer. Therefore, during the diagnosis process, the doctor may ask the patient to perform tests to see if the ulcer is caused by this type of bacteria.\nThere are many methods to test for HP bacteria in the stomach such as gastroscopy, blood tests, stool tests, and breath tests.
