    "content": "Diabetic retinopathy: symptoms, diagnosis, prevention\n\nHigh blood sugar over a long period of time will damage the nerves, causing complications in the heart, eyes, kidneys... A common complication in the eyes is diabetic retinopathy. So what is diabetic retinopathy? How to treat, diagnose and prevent?\n\nWhat is diabetic retinopathy?\nDiabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects the eyes. The disease occurs due to damage to the blood vessels of the retina. At first, diabetic retinopathy may cause no symptoms or only mild signs of vision loss. But in the long term, the disease can cause blindness. The longer people have diabetes, the higher their risk of eye complications. (first)\n\nCauses of diabetic retinopathy\nHigh blood sugar over a long period of time leads to blockage of small blood vessels that nourish the retina, cutting off blood supply to the retina. At that time, the eye will try to grow new blood vessels. But the new blood vessels don't develop properly and leak easily. Damage to blood vessels in the retina affects vision. If not treated early, it will cause dangerous eye complications.\nThe retina is damaged.\n\nStages of diabetic retinopathy\nDiabetic retinopathy is divided into 2 stages. (2)\nBasal (non-proliferative) retinopathy: this is the early stage of diabetic retinopathy, small blood vessels leak, causing the retina to swell, causing macular edema. This is the most common reason people with diabetes lose vision. In addition, blood vessels in the retina can narrow, causing macular ischemia, or exudates forming in the retina. These things affect the eye's vision.; Proliferative retinopathy: is a more severe stage of diabetic retinopathy. It occurs when the retina begins to grow new blood vessels. New blood vessels are often fragile and easily leak blood into the vitreous. If there is a lot of fluid leakage, it will cause blurring. New blood vessels can form scar tissue that affects the macula, leading to retinal detachment.\n\nSymptoms of diabetic retinopathy\nPeople with diabetic retinopathy often have no signs of abnormalities in the early stages. When the disease becomes more dangerous, its symptoms become clear, including:\nBlurred vision.; Seeing bright or dark areas; Difficulty seeing at night; See blurred or blurred colors; Vision is narrowed.\nIf you see unusual signs in the eyes, people with diabetes need to go to the hospital for timely examination and treatment.\n\nWho is at risk of getting the disease?\nAny diabetic patient is at risk of diabetic retinopathy, not excluding type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes. Diabetics are at higher risk of diabetic retinopathy if they have certain conditions. following factor. (3)\nPeople with long-term diabetes; Gestational diabetes.; High blood sugar levels that are not well controlled; High Blood Pressure.; High cholesterol.\n\nHow is the disease diagnosed?\nWhen people with diabetes are suspected of having problems related to diabetic retinopathy, their doctor will prescribe an eye examination as follows:\nOphthalmoscopy: using eye drops to dilate the pupils, the doctor will look through a special lens to examine your eyes.; Optical tomography: the doctor can do an optical tomography angiogram to closely observe the retina. Detailed images of the thickness of the retina help doctors find and measure the degree of macular edema.; OCT angiography: helps doctors see whether blood vessels in the retina are damaged or not. This is a new method to replace fluorescein angiography, patients do not need to inject contrast dye.\nSurgical treatment of diabetic retinopathy.\n\nHow to treat diabetic retinopathy\nDepending on the health condition of the eyes, the doctor will choose the appropriate treatment method for each individual. However, the first thing every diabetic patient needs to do is to control blood sugar and blood pressure well to prevent vision loss. See your diabetes doctor for guidance on appropriate diet and exercise for people with diabetes. Good blood sugar control makes treatment more effective. In addition, the patient will be prescribed one of the following treatment methods by the eye doctor: (4)\nEye injections: medications help reduce macular edema, slow vision loss, and may improve vision. Commonly used drugs include: avastin, eylea, lucentis... The drug is injected into the eye, patients can have multiple injections during treatment.; Laser: to reduce swelling in the retina, the ophthalmologist will use a laser to make the blood vessels shrink and stop leaking. The laser method is called diffuse laser surgery (sometimes called retinal photocoagulation). Before the laser procedure, you will have anesthetic drops placed in your eyes, a special lens will be used and the laser aimed at your eyes.; Surgery: vitrectomy is indicated in cases of retinal detachment to repair holes or tears in the retina. Resolves vitreous hemorrhage and treats retinal sources of bleeding.\nNote: after surgery, the eye may be swollen and red for a few weeks. While your eye is recovering, you may experience eye pain and worse vision than before surgery. Patients need to have regular vision check-ups to ensure their eyes are progressing well. After surgery, the patient needs to wear an eye patch, use eye drops to reduce swelling and prevent infection, avoid activities such as driving, high-intensity exercise, lifting heavy objects, flying, traveling... Rest Rest at home for 2 - 4 weeks.\n\nMethods to prevent diabetic retinopathy\nBelow are methods to prevent diabetic retinopathy that many patients should know:\nBlood sugar control: helps maintain blood sugar at a stable level to avoid damage to blood vessels. Control blood sugar by: having a healthy diet and appropriate physical activity. Take diabetes medication as prescribed by your doctor and have regular check-ups. Blood sugar testing records blood sugar levels several times a day.; Regular eye examinations: helps detect eye abnormalities early for early treatment, bringing high results and avoiding dangerous complications.; Keep blood pressure and cholesterol at safe levels: eat healthy foods, exercise regularly.; Don't smoke: smoking increases the risk of diabetes complications including retinopathy.; Pay attention to your eyes: if you detect unusual signs in your eyes, you should see an ophthalmologist for early examination.\nDiabetic retinopathy is one of the complications caused by long-term high blood sugar. Therefore, good control of blood sugar is very important to protect health. Regular eye exams are one of the ways to help keep your eyes healthy.",
