    "content": "Otosclerosis: Causes, signs, complications, treatment, prevention\n\nOtosclerosis can cause dizziness, tinnitus, loss of balance, hearing loss, and deafness in one or both ears. Surgery is the most effective treatment method.\n\nWhat is otosclerosis?\nThe term otosclerosis is derived from the Greek words for “hard” (scler-o) and “ear” (oto).\nOtosclerosis is an abnormal bone growth around the base of the stapes, one of the small bones of the middle ear. This leads to fixation of the stapes. The stapes must move freely for the ear to function normally and hear clearly.\nListening is a complex process. In the normal ear, sound vibrations are transmitted from the outer ear into the ear canal where they hit the eardrum. These vibrations cause movement of the eardrum, which transmits vibrations to the three small bones of the middle ear, the malleus, incus, and stapes.\nWhen the stapes moves, it causes the fluid in the ear to move, which in turn begins the process of stimulating the hair cells in the inner ear, which connect to the auditory nerve. The auditory nerve then carries sound information to the brain, resulting in hearing sounds. When any part of this process is damaged, hearing loss occurs.\nThe stapes - the smallest bone in the body - is very susceptible to damage - the cause of hearing loss. Photo: Wikipedia\n\nCause of otosclerosis\nOtosclerosis most commonly occurs when one of the bones in the middle ear, the stapes, becomes stuck in place. This condition is also known as auricular bone dysplasia. When this bone cannot vibrate, sound cannot pass through the ear and hearing is impaired.\nTo date, it is unclear why this happens, but scientists think it may be related to previous measles infection. The measles virus can cause infection in patients with a genetic predisposition to otosclerosis. Immune disorders are also thought to be risk factors for the disease.\nOtosclerosis can also run in families and half of cases are hereditary. A person has a 25% risk of developing otosclerosis if one parent has the condition and a 50% risk if both parents have it.\nIn addition, the disease may also involve interactions between three different cells of the immune system called cytokines. Researchers found that a balance of these three substances helps regenerate healthy bones. Therefore, an imbalance in their levels can cause the type of abnormal regeneration that occurs in otosclerosis.\nHearing loss due to otosclerosis rarely manifests as early as age 7-8, but most cases do not become apparent until late adolescence or early adulthood when the hearing loss does not occur. Slowly progressive symmetry is diagnosed.(1)\nThe disease is common in women at twice the rate as in adult men. The age of onset of otosclerosis is from 15 to 45 years old, with an average of 33 years old.\n\nSigns of otosclerosis\nStatistics also show that the majority of people with otosclerosis have hearing abnormalities at the age of 30-40. This condition can affect one or both ears.\nSymptoms of otosclerosis can be difficult to distinguish from other causes of hearing loss. The most common symptoms are the following:\nHearing loss gets worse over time;; It is even more difficult to hear when encountering low, deep and whispering sounds;; Speak softly, softly because you feel your voice is loud;; Feels easier to hear in the presence of background noise (different from other types of hearing loss);; Feeling tinnitus (hearing a buzzing, ringing sound as if it comes from inside the ear);; Dizziness occurs.(2)\nOtosclerosis often occurs in young people, the rate of women suffering from the disease is 2 times higher than men\n\nDiagnosis method of otosclerosis\nThe first step in diagnosis is to rule out other diseases or health problems that can cause otosclerosis-like symptoms.\nNext steps include hearing tests to measure hearing sensitivity (audiogram) and sound conduction in the middle ear (tympanogram).\nSometimes, diagnostic imaging, such as a CT scan, is also used to identify otosclerosis.(3)\n\nComplications of otosclerosis\nComplications of otosclerosis (if they occur), the most common are:\nHearing loss; Deafness in one or both ears; Tinnitus; Dizzy\n\nTreatment methods for otosclerosis\nOtosclerosis can be treated with the following methods:\n1. Using medicine\nCertain medications such as sodium fluoride supplements or bisphosphonates have been reported to limit the worsening of otosclerosis. However, these drugs do not have strong evidence of stopping its progression.\n2. Hearing aids\nMild otosclerosis can be treated by wearing sound-amplifying hearing aids.\nIf there are symptoms of vertigo, the patient should have a vestibular examination to treat other causes of vertigo before performing otosclerosis surgery.(4)\n3. Stapedectomy\nUnder general anesthesia, the doctor uses a microscope combined with an endoscope to make a small incision in the ear canal. This is to create a strip of the ear canal to the eardrum, dissecting and protecting the tympanic cord nerve.\nWhen the bones of the posterior wall of the ear canal are expanded, the doctor can clearly observe the ossicular structures in the middle ear and check the condition of the stapes joint with the oval window. Thanks to that, the doctor can separate the stapes bone from the oval window when cutting the entire stapes bone.\nNext, the doctor will insert the artificial material Prosthesis into the correct position to transmit sound vibrations to the inner ear, helping restore hearing. Prosthesis is an artificial bone made of titanium or fluoroplastic that has the same sound conduction function as the stapes.\nFinally, the doctor will seal the incision with the patient's ear flap cartilage and move the eardrum back to its place.\nDr. Hang and the surgical team at the Department of Ear, Nose and Throat, Tam Anh General Hospital successfully performed the surgery using endoscopic microsurgery technique.\n4. Cochlear implant\nIn advanced cases of otosclerosis, causing inner ear (sensorineural) hearing loss, stapedectomy may not be enough to restore hearing. In these situations, a cochlear implant may be considered.\n\nPreventing complications after otosclerosis surgery\nOtosclerosis surgery can also have some risks if the doctor lacks experience and the equipment is outdated. The most likely surgical risks include damage to the eardrum, nerve damage, worsening hearing loss, and prolonged dizziness...\nTherefore, choosing a reputable hospital and highly skilled doctor will greatly determine the success of the surgery.\nTo prevent possible complications after surgery, Dr. Hang recommends:\nPatients need to rest for the first week and avoid strenuous exercise for at least 3 weeks.; Eat a diverse, nutritious diet, but need to limit foods that can cause allergies, such as seafood; Avoid exposure to noise, especially loud sounds such as the sound of halls, construction sites, factories...; Avoid swimming, ear picking, and flying until the wound has fully recovered.; Don't blow your nose.; Take medicine as prescribed by your doctor and follow-up appointments with the doctor taking care of your surgical wound, at least 2 times after surgery.; Keep the ear and incision dry and clean.; Disinfect the wound and change the ear bandage every day\n\nFrequently asked questions about otosclerosis\n1. Is otosclerosis dangerous?\nOtosclerosis is a benign disease and usually does not cause complications that directly threaten health. However, if left untreated, hearing loss and deafness can cause the patient to encounter many troubles in life.\nFor example, deafness can increase the risk of accidents when participating in traffic because the sound signals of vehicles on the road cannot be heard.\n2. How to prevent otosclerosis?\nBecause the cause of otosclerosis is unknown, there are no official recommendations for preventing this disease. With many years of experience in examining and treating otosclerosis, Dr. Hang advises that we should go to the Ear, Nose and Throat Department at reputable hospitals for examination and treatment when:\nSymptoms of tinnitus, dizziness, hearing loss, unknown cause; Working-age women with signs of hearing loss and a family history of otosclerosis.\n3. After otosclerosis surgery, if you have any symptoms, do you need to go to the hospital immediately?\nAfter returning home from surgery, if the following symptoms appear, the patient needs to go to the hospital immediately. These symptoms show that you may experience complications after surgery.\nEar bleeding; Persistent or severe dizziness; Sudden hearing loss\n4. Is otosclerosis surgery painful?\nSurgery is performed under general anesthesia, so during the surgery and until the anesthetic takes effect, the patient will not feel pain. However, afterward, you may experience some conditions such as ear pain, tinnitus or dizziness in the first few days after surgery.\nYour sense of taste may also be altered for weeks or months after surgery, but will usually return to normal.\n5. Can otosclerosis surgery be performed on both ears at the same time?\nIf both ears have otosclerosis, the surgeon will usually choose to operate on the less severe ear first. Do not have surgery on both ears at the same time. Each ear should be operated on at least 3-4 months apart.\nWith a team of highly qualified and experienced medical doctors, equipped with modern machinery systems imported from abroad such as Xion ENT endoscope (Germany), Zeiss ear microsurgical system (Germany), Karl Storz endoscopic surgery system (Germany), Natus vestibular function measuring machine (USA), vestibular measurement system using dynamic tonography (VNG), Medtronic tissue drill (USA), Coblator ablation machine and plasma (USA), Interacoustic audiometer (Denmark)... Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Tam Anh General Hospital accurately diagnoses and effectively treats diseases of the ear, nose and throat - audiology - vocal - vestibular, lifting. high quality of life for patients.\nOtosclerosis causes hearing loss or deafness. This condition greatly affects living, studying, work as well as quality of life in general. Dr. Hang advises people with risk factors such as pregnant women, women of working age whose parents have otosclerosis, and people with ear symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. face... you should go to a hospital with an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist for early examination and treatment. Early treatment will give better results and a higher chance of restoring hearing.",
