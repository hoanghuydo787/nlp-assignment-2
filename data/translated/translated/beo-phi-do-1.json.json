    "content": "Obesity level 1: Causes, symptoms and treatment\n\nObesity is a concern of every generation. Since 1981, the proportion of overweight and obese people has continuously increased worldwide and has doubled in more than 73 countries. Obesity has many levels, of which level 1 obesity is the most common form. The article below will provide an overview of the causes, symptoms as well as treatment of this type 1 obesity disease.\n\nWhat is grade 1 obesity?\nObesity is a condition in which more fat accumulates in the body than normal. Usually obesity is related to genetic, physiological and environmental factors, combined with diet and physical activity. Among them, type 1 obesity is the most common and mildest form. Adults are diagnosed with stage 1 obesity when they have a BMI greater than or equal to 30. (1)\nPreviously, obesity was a common disease in high-income countries, but is now increasing significantly in developing countries, including Vietnam. Currently, the rate of obese adults in Vietnam is about 15%, of which the number of obese patients in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City accounts for 18% of the total number of obesity cases nationwide.\n\nCommon levels of obesity\nIncludes 3 levels:\nObesity level 1: BMI from 30 to under 35.; Obesity level 2: BMI from 35 to less than 40.; Obesity level 3: BMI 40 or more (severe).\n\nWeight  index chart\nBMI is a commonly used measure of body fat today. BMI is not used to directly measure body fat, but it is quite similar to other direct measurements such as skinfold thickness measurements and bioelectrical impedance analysis. ), measuring body weight underwater (underwater weighing), or DXA technique (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry). (2)\nBMI is strongly correlated with various health outcomes of body fatness. However, in the end, BMI is only a screening tool, so the most accurate diagnosis of obesity or body health status will be made by doctors and health care professionals.\nThe way to calculate BMI is to take your weight (in kilograms) and divide it by the square of your height (in meters). A high BMI can indicate high body fat and vice versa.\nBMI below 18.5: malnutrition.; BMI from 18.5 to less than 25: healthy.; BMI from 25 to less than 30: overweight.; BMI of 30 or more: obesity.\n\nCauses of grade 1 obesity\nThe most basic cause of level 1 obesity is that the body takes in more calories than it consumes. This state of energy imbalance continues to lead to the obesity disease we commonly know. Therefore, if you eat fewer calories than your body burns, your weight will decrease (3). There are many reasons leading to this surplus, including direct and indirect factors:\n1. Genes are not the deciding factor\nGenetic genes play a role in obesity, but generally at a low level. Genes only increase the risk of weight gain and promote  better with other environmental factors, such as unhealthy diet and lack of exercise. Therefore, maintaining a healthy lifestyle is the best prevention against these genetic effects.\n2. Affects the duration of pregnancy\nWhen pregnant, women are often encouraged to gain 10 - 12kg so that the fetus can develop healthily. However, after giving birth, it is very difficult for pregnant mothers to lose weight because they tend to follow a prenatal diet, easily leading to a higher than normal risk of level 1 obesity.\nPregnant mothers who smoke or are overweight may give birth to children who are more likely to be obese. Excessive weight gain during childhood also increases the risk of obesity in adulthood. Breastfeeding your baby can reduce this risk.\n3. Unhealthy diet\nEating habits that are harmful to the body such as drinking milk tea, soft drinks, baked goods, calorie-rich foods such as fried chicken, French fries, etc. will put a huge amount of calories into the body, increasing stored fat. storage, causing obesity.\nOn the contrary, adding foods to your diet such as whole grains, vegetables, fruits and nuts will help control weight and prevent chronic diseases.\nUnhealthy diet is the cause of obesity.\n4. Passive lifestyle\nLife is so busy that many people forget to exercise and train their bodies and sit for hours on the computer. This causes excess energy, belly fat accumulation and causes grade 1 obesity. Lack of sleep will disrupt hormones and biological rhythms, making the body hungry faster than usual.\n5. Living environment\nThe physical and social environment in which people live plays a huge role in the food choices and activities they undertake. Therefore, relatives of obese patients will often be at greater risk of being overweight and obese  because of similar activities and similar nutritional regimens.\n6. Aging\nThe older you get, the worse your body's metabolism becomes, easily causing the accumulation of excess fat.\n7. Other diseases\nSome diseases such as polycystic ovary syndrome, hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, etc. cause patients to suffer from endocrine disorders. They will often feel excessively stressed, so they will need to find food to relieve and satisfy hunger, causing stage 1 obesity.\n\nSymptoms of grade 1 obesity\nWhen you are obese, your body will give you warning signals so you can adjust your weight. Common obesity symptoms include:\nWaist measurement increases. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), when the waist/hip measurement ratio is over 0.9 for men or 0.85 for women, there is a risk of level 1 obesity; Frequently feeling hungry; Having skin problems (stretch marks, dark skin and sagging neck skin).; Decreased vision; Varicose veins; Appearance of snoring; Feeling short of breath for a long time; The body often feels tired and sluggish; Knee, back or hip pain; Burping after eating; Irregular menstrual cycle.\n\nDiagnosis of grade 1 obesity\nStage 1 obesity is actually very difficult to recognize with the naked eye. Furthermore, the ratio and location of excess fat distributed on the body are different according to gender. Therefore, the Ministry of Health has come up with the 3 most accurate ways to identify stage 1 obesity, which are:\n1. Calculate BMI (25 =< BMI < 30)\nBMI is calculated by dividing body weight (in kilograms) by the square of height (in meters). For example, a person who is 175cm tall and weighs 90kg will have a BMI = 90 / (1.75)2 = 29.38. Because the BMI value is 29.38 - between 25 and 29.99, this person is diagnosed with level 1 obesity.\n2. Measure waist circumference (for men: >= 90, for women: >= 80)\nMeasure waist circumference by standing straight in a natural position, feet shoulder-width apart, then slinging the tape measure across the line between the lowest rib and the upper edge of the pelvis. If the waist circumference for women is 80cm or more, or 90cm for men, this means you have stage 1 obesity.\n3. Use DXA Technology (25 =< BMI < 30)\nDXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) uses X-rays at two different energy levels to determine body fat percentage and composition. If the BMI equals or exceeds 30, it is also diagnosed as level 1 obesity.\n\nTreatment of grade 1 obesity\nBecause it is the mildest level of all obesity levels, level 1 obesity can be completely treated by making scientific lifestyle changes.\n1. Healthy diet\nBusy lives make many people choose pre-processed foods with quite high calorie content. This eating habit leads to increasing obesity rates. Therefore, nutrition experts give advice on building menus for effective weight loss for obese people as follows:\nDivide meals into small portions to control calorie intake.; Eat slowly, chew thoroughly; Limit junk food.; Add foods containing fiber that are beneficial for metabolism such as green vegetables and fruits.; Eat whole grain starches such as cereals, brown rice, corn,...; Minimize foods high in sugar and fat such as fast food; Do not drink alcohol or carbonated soft drinks.\nAdding lots of green vegetables to your diet helps your body control weight effectively.\n2. Exercise\nFor effective weight loss, regular exercise is a factor that cannot be ignored. Doctors recommend that you exercise 30 - 45 minutes/day and maintain it at least 5 days/week. Obese people can freely choose exercises and intensity depending on their ability. However, if you have other health problems, you need to consult your doctor to find suitable exercises. For people with stage 1 obesity who don't have enough time, you just need to try to exercise instead of just sitting in one place. Daily activities such as doing housework and going for a walk will be a good alternative.\n3. Get enough sleep\nResearch shows that sleeping less than 5 hours increases the risk of obesity 2.5 times more than normal. Lack of sleep causes the body to produce a type of  hormone that stimulates appetite, especially high-calorie foods like sweets. Getting enough sleep helps your metabolism run better, thereby controlling your weight.\n4. Drink enough water\nWater helps reduce appetite and limits cholesterol in the body to a low level. This is the ideal friend for obese people. So drink 2 liters of water every day to protect your health.\nRegular exercise helps reduce the risk of obesity.\nSee more: The connection between obesity and diabetes\n\nWhat diseases can level 1 obesity cause?\nGrade 1 obesity is the cause of more than 200 different diseases, including dangerous diseases such as arthritis, rheumatism, blood fat, fatty liver, atherosclerosis, cerebral vascular obstruction and even stroke. Not only that, grade 1 obesity is a risk factor for many cancers, especially gastrointestinal cancer...\nGrade 1 obesity is not easy to recognize with the naked eye. So to get accurate results, patients need to go to a reputable hospital to conduct examination and treatment as soon as possible when detecting symptoms of grade 1 obesity.",
