Equipping with scientific knowledge about disease signs and effective treatment methods helps patients recognize early, receive timely treatment, and avoid dangerous complications.\n In the list of 30 occupations included in the health insurance payment category,\npneumoconiosis\n accounts for the highest proportion with 74% of cases. Latest statistics from the Ministry of Health show that Vietnam has nearly 28,000 infected workers\nsick\n, however the actual number may be many times higher (1). Dust in the lungs will harden the lungs, putting the patient at risk of losing the ability to work, even threatening their life.\nPeople who work in dusty environments are at risk of getting sick\n\nWhat is pneumoconiosis?\nPneumoconiosis is one of a group of interstitial lung diseases caused by inhaling certain types of dust that damage the lungs. The disease is often encountered in the workplace, so it is also called occupational lung disease (2).\nThis is a condition in which dirt accumulates for many years in the lungs and progresses to disease. When a patient's lungs cannot remove all of these dust particles, it leads to pneumonia, which can cause scar tissue. The disease also damages the blood vessels and air sacs in the lungs, causing the tissues surrounding the air sacs and airways to become thicker and stiffer. This condition is called interstitial lung disease, and patients may experience more severe symptoms of difficulty breathing.\n\nClassify\nProf. Dr. Ngo Quy Chau said that the disease appears in many different forms, depending on the type of dust in the patient's lungs. Among them, the most common are asbestosis, silicosis and coal workers' pneumoconiosis (also known as CWP or black lung). As the name suggests, these diseases occur when people inhale asbestos fibers, silica dust and coal mine dust.\nThe disease can appear in simple or complex forms. In simple cases, small scar tissue may appear on X-ray in the form of circles and thickening, also known as nodules. In cases where the disease progresses complicatedly, causing complications and the lungs have a lot of scarring, it is called pulmonary fibrosis.\nThe disease causes scar tissue in the lungs\nNormally, when dust particles enter the lungs, it takes many years to form and develop into disease. However, in some cases the disease can progress rapidly after only a short time when the patient inhales a large amount of dust into the lungs, especially silica dust. Severe progression of the disease can lead to lung failure, deterioration of internal organs, disability and life-threatening risk.\n\nCauses dust to enter the lungs\nThe main cause of dust in the lungs is due to patients coming into contact with materials that are capable of dispersing very small particles and entering the lungs. There are many types of dust, the most common of which are asbestos, coal dust and most commonly silica.\nSilicon is found in sand, sandstone, granite, slate, metals and coal ores. Silicosis usually forms and progresses slowly, usually occurring about 5-10 years after the patient is exposed to this type of dust.\n\nCommon symptoms\nProfessor Wu Guizhou said that symptoms vary depending on the causative agent and severity of the disease. Patients may have no symptoms, or have symptoms ranging from mild to severe. The most common symptoms are:\nDry cough or cough with black phlegm;; May cough up blood in the morning;; Feeling of sharp pain in the chest, chest tightness;; Difficulty breathing, shortness of breath.\nPatients may cough dryly, cough up black phlegm or cough up blood\n\nDangerous complications when dust enters the lungs\n“If dust entering the lungs is not detected early and promptly intervened, it can lead to dangerous, even life-threatening complications. Even if the patient has been treated, but not given good care and not prevented from causing the disease to relapse, it can still cause complications,\" Prof. Dr. Ngo Quy Chau emphasized.\nCommon dangerous complications include:\nChronic bronchitis;; Respiratory failure;; Lung cancer;; Tuberculosis;; Heart failure due to pressure from inside the lungs.\n\nWho is at high risk of getting pneumoconiosis?\nAnyone who comes into direct contact with dust is at risk of breathing it into their lungs, leading to illness. One study found that about 16% of coal miners in the US may suffer from interstitial fibrosis caused by coal dust (3).\nBesides, some other risk factors include:\nPeople who smoke regularly;; People exposed to high levels of dust;; People exposed to dust for long periods of time.\nPeople with the habit of smoking have a high risk of getting the disease\n\nWhen do patients need to go to a medical facility immediately?\nPatients need to immediately go to a medical facility for examination, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment when they have symptoms of difficulty breathing, persistent cough, dry cough or cough with black phlegm. In addition, if the patient is in the high-risk group, they should immediately go to a medical facility for screening, early detection of abnormal signs and the most effective treatment.\n\nDiagnostic method\nWhen there are unusual symptoms in the lungs, the doctor will conduct an examination and ask about the working environment, as well as history of related diseases, if any. Next, to diagnose the level of pneumoconiosis more accurately, the doctor may prescribe paraclinical testing methods. Experts recommend that underground coal miners must have chest X-rays every 3 or 5 years to detect diseases early and intervene promptly (4).\nDiagnostic methods to determine dust in the lungs include:\nAsk about work environment, history and level of exposure to dust;; History of lung-related diseases;; Physical examination;; Chest X-ray or CT scan to detect lung nodules, lung tumors, and interstitial disease;; Blood gas test.; Surgical biopsy is to remove lung tissue to perform other necessary tests.\nChest X-ray or CT scan helps detect tumors in the lungs\n\nTreatments\nThere is currently no definitive treatment. Current methods are mainly using antibiotics, lung lavage or oxygen breathing to control disease symptoms, prevent the risk of the disease progressing rapidly, causing dangerous complications, threatening health and life. patient's life. (5)\nSome recommendations to help make treatment more effective include:\nStop smoking if you have this habit;; Avoid exposure to dust. In cases where due to the nature of the job, it is necessary to take necessary measures to protect the airway, especially periodic examinations are needed to detect the disease early;; Some patients with symptoms of difficulty breathing may consider oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation;; Use bronchodilators to open lung segments, reducing symptoms of difficulty breathing in patients. However, the use of medication requires a doctor's prescription, and patients are advised not to use the medication arbitrarily to avoid unwanted side effects.\n\nHow to take care of the sick?\nTo speed up the post-treatment recovery process, patients need to take care of their own health by paying attention to the following recommendations:\nStop smoking and avoid secondhand smoke;; Rest properly, don't overwork;; Follow a scientific diet, providing adequate nutrition for the body. Meals can be divided into smaller meals if bloating makes the patient have difficulty breathing;; Exercise regularly. Ask your doctor for advice on appropriate exercises to support better lung function recovery.\n\nHow to prevent dusty lung disease?\nCurrently, there is no thorough treatment for pneumoconiosis, so prevention plays an extremely important role. Prof. Dr. Ngo Quy Chau shared some preventive measures such as:\nGet fully vaccinated as recommended by the Ministry of Health;; Wear a mask properly;; Wash your hands thoroughly with soap, especially after contact with dirt;; No smoking;; Regular health check-ups to detect abnormalities early;; Workers who regularly work and are exposed to dust need to wear full protective equipment such as clothes, masks, sunglasses...; Go immediately to a medical facility for examination, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment instructions when unusual symptoms occur.\nBeing fully equipped with protective equipment is one of the ways to help prevent disease\nFor advice and to schedule an examination with leading experts at the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nPneumoconiosis can cause dangerous complications, threatening the patient's health and life. Therefore, patients should not be subjective when there are abnormal signs in the lungs. Come immediately to the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Tam Anh General Hospital to be directly examined by doctors, accurately diagnosed and advised on effective treatment!",
