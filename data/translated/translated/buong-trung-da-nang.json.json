    "content": "Polycystic ovary syndrome: Causes, signs, diagnosis and treatment\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a gynecological disease related to hormonal imbalance, which not only reduces fertility but also increases the risk of many other serious diseases. So what are the causes, common symptoms and effective treatments for this syndrome?\n\nWhat is polycystic ovary syndrome?\nPolycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder in women of reproductive age. The disease has many effects on the ovaries, causing menstrual cycle disorders, increasing male hormone levels, leading to the formation of many small cysts inside the ovaries.\nStatistics show that about 2.2 - 26.7% of women of reproductive age (15 - 44 years old) have polycystic ovary syndrome. And many of them do not know they have the disease, so they do not treat it early, leading to many complications. (first)\n\n8 common signs of polycystic ovary syndrome\nIn some women, signs of polycystic ovary syndrome may appear very early in the first menstrual period. However, in most cases, symptoms of the disease are only discovered when they have difficulty getting pregnant. (2)\nCommon symptoms of the disease include:\n1. Irregular menstruation\nIrregular, often unusually long menstrual cycles are the most common sign of polycystic ovary syndrome. The cause is a problem with the ovulation process, causing the uterine lining to not shed every month. Besides, the uterine lining is formed and develops over a long period of time, leading to the amount of blood in each period being more than normal.\n2. Excessive hair growth (hirsutism)\nMore than 70% of women with this syndrome experience \"hairiness\" on the face, back, abdomen and chest. On the other hand, many people also experience baldness due to weak hair follicles, hair loss, thinning and thinning. Both of these phenomena stem from an increase in male hormones in the body.\n3. Obesity\nUp to 80% of women with polycystic ovary syndrome are overweight or obese.\n4. Oily facial skin, acne appears\nIncreased levels of male hormones cause the skin to secrete more oil than usual, leading to acne appearing on the face, back, chest...\n5. Skin darkening\nDark skin patches appear on the body in areas with many folds such as the neck, groin and under the breasts.\n6. Headache\nSome people may experience headaches due to hormonal changes.\n7. Mood swings\nWomen with polycystic ovary syndrome will often feel stressed and anxious. This condition can cause depression if prolonged.\n8. Pain and discomfort in the pelvic area\nWhen suffering from this syndrome, women may experience dull pain ranging from mild to severe (feeling like menstrual cramps), and feel discomfort in the abdomen, pelvis and lower back.\n\nCauses of polycystic ovary syndrome\nCurrently, the cause of polycystic ovary syndrome has not been clearly determined (3). However, experts believe that the disease may originate from the following factors:\n1. Insulin resistance\nInsulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, responsible for converting carbohydrates and lipids into energy to help the body function. Insulin is also the only agent in the body that can reduce blood glucose levels.\nStatistics show that up to 70% of women with the disease have insulin resistance, meaning the cells inside their bodies cannot use insulin properly. At that time, blood sugar levels increase, and the body increases insulin production. Excess insulin will trigger the ovaries to increase the production of male hormones, making it difficult to ovulate.\nObesity is also one of the main causes of insulin resistance. Both obesity and insulin resistance increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.\n2. Genetics\nStudies show that certain genes are related to polycystic ovary syndrome, so if your family has a mother or sister with this syndrome, the risk of developing the disease will be higher.\n3. Diet\nThe theory is that a diet too high in starch may be a contributing factor to polycystic ovary syndrome.\n\nIs polycystic ovary syndrome dangerous?\nTTND.Associate Professor, PhD.BSCKII Luu Thi Hong, Head of Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, said that higher than normal Androgen concentrations in people with polycystic ovary syndrome will affect fertility along with many other health aspects.\nCommon complications of this syndrome include:\n1. Difficulty getting pregnant\nPolycystic ovary syndrome will disrupt the ovulation process, reducing the chance of pregnancy. This is proven to be one of the causes of infertility in women.\nPolycystic ovary syndrome is one of the causes of infertility in women\n2. Metabolic syndrome\nPolycystic ovary syndrome can lead to metabolic disorders such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar, low HDL cholesterol, high LDL cholesterol... increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke...\n3. Sleep apnea syndrome\nSleep apnea is a condition where breathing stops for a short period of time during sleep, repeated many times at night. This condition is common in overweight and obese women. In particular, obese women with PCOS are 5-10 times more likely to develop sleep apnea than normal people.\n4. Endometrial cancer\nAfter about 14 days of ovulation, the uterine lining will shed. If eggs are not released regularly every month, this lining will not shed and thicken, increasing the risk of endometrial cancer.\nPolycystic ovary syndrome, if not treated early, can lead to endometrial cancer complications.\n5. Depression\nHormonal changes lead to symptoms such as baldness, hirsutism, dark skin, overweight... which will negatively affect a woman's emotions and spirit. They will often be worried and sad, especially if this condition lasts for a long time, easily leading to depression.\nReference: Complications of polycystic ovary syndrome\n\nDiagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome\nTo diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome, the doctor will ask for information related to symptoms, current health status and medical history of the patient and family. Questions are often related to the menstrual cycle and weight changes over a certain period of time. (4)\nIn addition, the doctor examines other signs such as acne, hair growth, insulin resistance and a number of other symptoms that the patient experiences. Based on the examination results, the doctor will prescribe paraclinical tests such as:\nBlood test: measures and analyzes hormone levels, from which the doctor will rule out cases that cause menstrual disorders or increased Androgen similar to PCOS. In addition, the blood test also shows the level of glucose tolerance, fasting cholesterol and triglyceride levels.; Ultrasound: From the ultrasound image, the doctor can check the current condition of the ovaries and the thickness of the uterine lining.\nUltrasound helps doctors accurately diagnose the current condition of the ovaries to have appropriate treatment methods\nIn case you are diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome, you may be prescribed additional tests to look for complications. Additional tests include:; Check blood pressure, glucose tolerance, cholesterol and triglyceride levels periodically.; Screening for depression and anxiety; Screening for sleep apnea syndrome.\n\nHow to treat polycystic ovary syndrome and how long does it take?\nPolycystic ovary syndrome can seriously affect the patient's health, psychology and life. Therefore, once diagnosed with this syndrome, the patient needs to have a treatment plan as soon as possible according to the doctor's treatment regimen. (5)\nDepending on the disease condition, overall health and ability to respond to treatment methods, the patient is guided with a specific treatment regimen. The treatment process usually begins with adjusting living habits and changing lifestyle, including weight loss, diet and exercise.\n1. Lose weight\nResearch shows that losing 5-10% of body weight can help regulate the menstrual cycle and improve PCOS symptoms. In addition, weight loss also helps improve cholesterol levels, reduce insulin, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\nPatients should consult their doctor about an effective weight loss plan and prevention of polycystic ovary disease\n2. Diet\nA low-carbohydrate diet is effective for both weight loss and lowering insulin levels in the body of people with PCOS. A low glycemic index (GI) diet also helps regulate the menstrual cycle better than a regular diet.\nReference: What to eat and what to avoid with polycystic ovary syndrome?\n3. Exercise\nSome studies demonstrate that moderate-intensity exercise for 30 minutes/day, at least 3 days/week, will help women with polycystic ovary syndrome lose weight. In addition, exercise also helps improve ovulation and insulin levels in women.\n4. Using medicine\nPolycystic ovary syndrome can be treated with the following medications:\nBirth control pills: Using birth control pills combined with estrogen and progestin every day helps balance hormones in the patient's body, regulate ovulation, reduce PCOS symptoms and prevent endometrial cancer. Patients can use contraceptive patches or vaginal rings instead of medication.; Metformin (Glucophage, Fortamet): Helps treat PCOS by improving insulin levels. Studies have proven that when using Metformin combined with exercise and dietary changes will help patients lose weight, reduce blood sugar levels and reduce menstrual disorders better than without using the drug.; Clomiphene (Clomid): This is a drug that supports fertility, used to stimulate ovulation so women with PCOS can get pregnant.; Hair removal methods: Some treatments can help patients prevent hair growth, or remove dense hair growth due to PCOS. Eflornithine (Vaniqa) cream is a prescription medication that slows hair growth. In addition, patients can refer to laser or electrolysis hair removal methods, which help remove unwanted hair on the face and body.\nIt is recommended that patients should not arbitrarily use drugs without a doctor's prescription to avoid dangerous complications due to side effects of the drug.\n5. Laparoscopic ovarian surgery\nIn certain cases, doctors may prescribe surgery to improve a patient's fertility when other treatments are ineffective. The doctor will perform a laparoscopy, cut the angle of the ovary to open the ovarian surface to facilitate ovulation or create small holes in the ovary (ovarian cautery surgery) to reduce male hormone levels. sex, stimulates ovulation.\nDepending on the current condition and health of the patient, the doctor will advise on an appropriate treatment regimen\nAlthough this method is only temporarily effective, more than 50% of women can become pregnant within 1 year of surgery.\nSee more: Can you get pregnant with polycystic ovary syndrome?\n6. IVF test tube fertilization\nAnother treatment method that helps people with polycystic ovary syndrome get pregnant is in vitro fertilization (IVF). The doctor will take the couple's eggs and sperm and fertilize them in the laboratory to create an embryo. Then, the embryo is placed in the wife's uterus to continue developing.\n\nHow to prevent polycystic ovary syndrome\nTTND.Associate Professor, PhD.BSCKII Luu Thi Hong said that although the exact cause of polycystic ovary syndrome has not yet been determined, women can completely prevent the disease as well as other complications. dangerous complications of the disease by building a healthy lifestyle and activities, improving the quality of daily life. Detail:\nMaintain a reasonable weight: Losing weight and maintaining a reasonable weight not only helps women have good health, but also reduces the negative effects of the disease on the body. It is recommended that women consult a doctor or nutritionist to develop a scientific diet and have a weight control plan as desired.; Carbohydrate restriction: A diet low in fat and high in carbohydrates will increase insulin levels. Therefore, it is necessary to limit the amount of carbohydrates in the diet.; Exercise regularly: Increasing physical activity regularly will support the treatment and prevention of insulin resistance, help control weight, and prevent diabetes.; Regular gynecological examinations: Regular gynecological examinations help detect signs of disease early, even when the disease has no obvious symptoms. Not only that, regular gynecological examinations also help screen and treat promptly, preventing dangerous complications of many other gynecological diseases. Therefore, obstetrics and gynecology experts recommend that women have regular gynecological examinations every 6 months or as directed by a doctor.\nWomen need to build a healthy lifestyle to prevent the risk of disease.\n\nFrequently asked questions about polycystic ovary syndrome\n1. Why do I have polycystic ovary syndrome but my menstruation is still regular?\nAbnormal menstrual cycle is the most common symptom of polycystic syndrome. Patients may have too much or too little menstrual bleeding, sparse menstruation, or even no menstruation... However, there are cases where women with the disease still have the disease. Have regular menstrual periods every month. The reason is that the patient has mild polycystic ovary syndrome, the other ovary still functions normally, so it still produces stable sex hormones, and the menstrual cycle is not affected.\n2. Do thin women have polycystic ovary syndrome?\nMost women with polycystic ovary syndrome are overweight or obese. However, there are still cases of fit or thin people getting the disease. Therefore, to determine for sure whether they have this syndrome or not, women need to see a specialist for accurate diagnosis and early treatment.\n3. Can I have children with polycystic ovary syndrome?\nWomen with polycystic ovary syndrome are still able to get pregnant and give birth naturally, but the conception rate will be lower than normal women. If the disease is not treated early and properly, the risk of infertility will increase. Therefore, as soon as there are unusual symptoms, women need to see a doctor early to receive timely intervention and treatment.\n4. Is bilateral polycystic ovary syndrome dangerous?\nBilateral polycystic ovary syndrome is a phenomenon in which many small cysts of different sizes appear on both sides of the ovary. If these follicles fail to develop, they will prevent ovulation, fertilization, and pregnancy formation.\nWhether it is unilateral or bilateral polycystic ovary syndrome, if not detected early and treated properly, there is still a risk of reduced fertility and many other dangerous complications such as diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, stroke... In addition, bilateral polycystic ovary syndrome increases the risk of infertility. However, if treated properly, the patient can still become pregnant and give birth naturally.\n5. Does polycystic ovary syndrome require surgery?\nIn cases where medical treatments are ineffective, doctors will prescribe surgery to treat polycystic ovary syndrome, increasing women's chances of conception and pregnancy.\nCurrently, surgical methods to treat polycystic ovary syndrome include: cutting the ovarian angle, dissecting the orange segment to induce ovulation, ovarian point burning technique to stimulate ovulation... or laparoscopic ovarian point burning surgery. Endoscopic methods are less invasive, highly effective, and limit complications during and after surgery, so they should be given priority.\n6. When do women need to get tested for PCOS?\nWomen should have regular gynecological examinations, especially going to the hospital for check-ups as soon as possible when they have the following symptoms:\nMenstruation is late but not due to pregnancy.; Have symptoms of PCOS such as excessive hair growth on the face and body, often feeling very hungry or very thirsty, unexplained weight loss.; The couple had intercourse regularly, without using any methods, but for more than 12 months they were still not pregnant.\nInvested in building spacious facilities, gathering a team of doctors and nurses who are leading experts in the field of obstetrics and gynecology in Vietnam, possessing the most modern machinery system in the world...
