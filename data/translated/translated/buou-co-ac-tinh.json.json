    "content": "Malignant goiter: Symptoms, diagnosis and prevention\n\nAccording to statistics from the Ministry of Health, thyroid cancer ranks 9th among the most common cancers in Vietnam with more than 5,400 new cases in 2020. Malignant goiter can be treated successfully if detected. at an early stage.\n\nWhat is malignant goiter?\nMalignant goiter is also called thyroid cancer. Malignant goiter occurs when cells in the thyroid gland develop mutations that cause them to multiply rapidly, killing healthy cells and accumulating into tumors. The tumor can grow to invade nearby tissue and spread, metastasizing to lymph nodes in the neck, lungs, bones, liver, etc.\nGoiter in general and malignant goiter in particular are influenced by factors: geographical region, gender, and genetics. The increasing number of people with thyroid cancer being detected is partly due to advances in medicine, with modern diagnostic methods helping doctors detect the disease quickly. Sometimes the disease is discovered during routine health checks, CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasounds. If detected early, the tumor is usually small so it often responds well to treatment methods, improving life. (first)\n\nSymptoms of malignant goiter\nIn the early stages, malignant goiter does not cause symptoms but is only discovered through ultrasound examination or by chance during CT, MRI, or PET scans of the neck for other diseases. Symptoms of thyroid cancer will appear when the malignant tumor progresses such as: lump in the neck, hoarseness, moving lymph nodes in the neck, etc.\nFactors that may increase the risk of thyroid cancer include: (2)\nGender: Thyroid cancer occurs more in women than men, possibly due to the connection with the hormone estrogen (sex hormone produced by the ovaries).; Exposure to high levels of radiation: radiation treatments to the head and neck increase the risk of thyroid cancer.; Some genetic syndromes: Cowden syndrome, adenomatous polyposis, etc. increase the risk of thyroid cancer.\n\nSigns of late thyroid cancer\nLate-stage thyroid cancer is a condition in which the tumor has spread to soft tissue in the neck, lymph nodes and metastasized to the brain, lungs, heart, liver, and bones. About 30% of cases have metastatic cancer, mainly to the lymph nodes in the neck; Only 1% – 4% of cancers metastasize outside the neck to other organs such as the lungs and bones. Most patients with thyroid cancer have a good prognosis,  deaths are rare and occur mainly in patients whose cancer has spread outside the neck to other organs. (3)\nAccording to research by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (Cancer Research and Treatment Institute in New York, USA) on patients with metastatic thyroid cancer, 70% of patients have metastasized to lymph nodes in the lymph nodes. neck and 57% metastasized outside the neck. The lungs are the most common site of distant metastases with 84% of cases.\nMalignant goiter, also known as thyroid cancer, can be treated successfully if detected at an early stage.\n\nIs the incidence of malignant tumors in the neck high?\nThe incidence of malignant tumors in the neck is not high. Most cases of goiter are benign, about 5% - 15% of cases are malignant. The doctor will examine, do ultrasound, blood tests, cell aspiration, etc. to determine the type of cancer.\nDifferentiated thyroid cancer: includes types of thyroid cancer that begin in the cells that produce and store thyroid hormones. Viewed under a microscope, these thyroid cancer cells appear similar to healthy cells.\nPapillary thyroid cancer: is the most common thyroid cancer, occurring at all ages, most commonly in people between 30 and 50 years old. Most papillary thyroid cancers are small and respond well to treatment, even when the cancer cells metastasize to lymph nodes in the neck. A small number of cases of papillary thyroid cancer are aggressive and may develop to involve structures in the neck or spread to other areas of the body.\nFollicular thyroid cancer: is a rare thyroid cancer, usually affecting people over 50 years old. Follicular thyroid cancer cells usually do not metastasize to the lymph nodes in the neck. But there are still many cases where cancer cells thrive and spread to other parts of the body such as bones, lungs, etc.\nHurthle cell thyroid cancer: is a rare thyroid cancer. Rapid-cell thyroid cancer is very aggressive and can grow to structures in the neck and spread to other parts of the body.\nPoorly differentiated thyroid cancer: this rare type of thyroid cancer is more aggressive than other types of differentiated thyroid cancer and often does not respond to conventional treatments.\nNon-proliferative thyroid cancer: the disease causes many serious signs and symptoms such as: neck swelling, difficulty breathing,  difficulty swallowing. This type of cancer tends to occur in people over 60 years old. (4)\n\nHow to diagnose malignant goiter\nMalignant goiter is determined after aspirating cells and performing a number of thyroid tests, ultrasound, MRI scan, etc. After diagnosis, the doctor will prescribe appropriate treatment methods.\n1. Test determines hormone levels in the blood\nTests that measure levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and hormones produced by the thyroid gland provide information about thyroid health. This information can be used to choose imaging tests (ultrasound or radionuclide computed tomography) to look at thyroid nodules.\nTest information for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and hormones produced by the thyroid gland is used to select imaging tests (ultrasound or radionuclide computed tomography).\n2. Antibody test\nDepending on the results of thyroid function tests, your doctor may order blood tests to detect antibodies that are associated with autoimmune disorders, such as Hashimoto's disease or Graves' disease. (5)\n3. Thyroid ultrasound\nUltrasound uses sound waves to create images of parts of the body. Through ultrasound, the doctor determines whether the thyroid nodule is solid or filled with fluid (most solid thyroid nodules are cancerous). It is also used to check the number and size of thyroid nodules and to help determine if any nearby lymph nodes are enlarged due to metastatic thyroid cancer. (6)\nFor thyroid nodules that are too small to be felt, ultrasound technology is used to guide the biopsy needle into the nodule to obtain a specimen. Even when the nodule is large enough to be felt, most doctors still use ultrasound to guide the needle.\n4. Perform thyroid scintigraphy\nThyroid scintigraphy (radiometric computed tomography) is used to determine whether a patient with a lump in the neck may have thyroid cancer. This technique is often used in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (papillary, follicular or Hürthle cell) to determine whether the tumor has metastasized or not. Thyroid scans are not used for people with medullary thyroid cancer because these cells do not absorb iodine. (7)\nA thyroid scan works best if the patient has high blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone. For patients with low thyroid-stimulating hormone, the doctor will inject thyrotropin (Thyrogen) before the scan.\n5. Thyroid biopsy\nTo determine whether a thyroid tumor or nodule is cancerous, your doctor may prescribe a fine needle aspiration (FNA). The doctor will place a thin, hollow needle directly into the nodule to draw some cells and a few drops of fluid into a syringe. The doctor also takes samples from several areas of the nodule. The biopsy samples are sent to the laboratory.\nThyroid biopsy is usually performed on thyroid nodules larger than 1cm. Doctors often use ultrasound to view the thyroid during a biopsy to ensure the sample is taken from the correct location. A thyroid biopsy is also used to sample swollen lymph nodes in the neck to check if they contain cancer cells.\n\nHow to treat malignant goiter\nDepending on the type of thyroid cancer, there will be different treatments, such as:\nPapillary carcinoma and follicular carcinoma: surgery followed by radioactive iodine treatment.; Medullary thyroid carcinoma: surgery, then radiotherapy.; Non-productive thyroid carcinoma: radiotherapy and chemotherapy are often used to control symptoms.\n1. Surgery\nSurgery is the first treatment for most types of thyroid cancer. Depending on the condition, the doctor will surgically remove all or part of the thyroid gland and nearby lymph glands. After surgery, the patient rests for a few weeks and avoids any activities that affect the neck. (8)\n2. Radioactive iodine\nA course of radioactive iodine treatment is often recommended after surgery to destroy remaining cancer cells and reduce the risk of the cancer recurring. The patient will take radioactive iodine in liquid or capsule form. The thyroid gland absorbs radioactive iodine, which destroys cells in the thyroid gland. After treatment, patients take medication to maintain stable hormone levels.\nA course of radioactive iodine treatment is often recommended after surgery to destroy remaining cancer cells and reduce the risk of the cancer recurring.\n3. Take medicine\nDuring the treatment of malignant goiter, the doctor will prescribe medications appropriate to the patient's condition to ensure health. After surgery to remove the thyroid gland, this organ will no longer produce thyroid hormones. Therefore, patients need to take thyroid hormone replacement medication for life to prevent symptoms: fatigue, weight gain, weight loss, dry skin, etc. (9)\nOccasionally, the parathyroid glands may be affected during surgery. These are glands that regulate calcium levels in the blood. Patients must supplement calcium until the parathyroid glands function normally again.\n4. When is malignant goiter surgery required?\nSurgery (incision) is the first choice when treating most types of malignant goiter. Once a malignant goiter is determined, the doctor will monitor the progression of the disease, then determine the appropriate time for surgery. The malignant goiter surgery process requires skilled, experienced doctors and modern machinery and equipment. Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City with good doctors, leading experts and modern equipment will help patients feel secure in treatment.\nSee more: Is goiter dangerous? When is treatment needed?\n\nHow to prevent malignant goiter\nTo prevent goiter as well as malignant goiter, people should supplement their diet with marine fish, fish sauce, salt, etc. so that the body is fully supplied with iodine. These are popular, convenient, and easy-to-make foods that help reduce the risk of iodine deficiency.\nSupplement marine fish (mackerel, tuna, etc.) to fully supplement the body with iodine and prevent goiter.\nFor patients with a history of thyroid diseases, after treatment, regular health checks are needed to detect the disease and treat it promptly. When there are signs of goiter (throat stuck, painful, difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, choking, shortness of breath, etc.), you should immediately go to a medical facility for examination and treatment. When a doctor diagnoses a goiter, the patient should take medicine as prescribed by the doctor, have regular check-ups and should not arbitrarily treat it with folk remedies.\nMalignant goiter is a disease with a relatively low incidence. However, do not subjectively take it lightly when the disease is still in a benign stage. You need a suitable treatment plan and prevention method to minimize the risk of malignancy.
