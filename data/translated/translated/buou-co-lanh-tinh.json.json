    "content": "Benign goiter: Causes, diagnosis, treatment and prevention\n\nThe proportion of the world population with goiter is estimated at 15.8%. Benign goiters are not dangerous, but in many cases large goiters cause difficulty breathing, choking, hoarseness, etc. Therefore, goiter patients need to see a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology - Diabetes for monitoring and control. tumor progression and therapeutic intervention when necessary.\n\nWhat is a benign goiter?\nBenign goiter (medically called goiter) is a condition in which thyroid cells grow excessively or unevenly, with signs of increased thyroid size and abnormal swelling. This is one of the common types of thyroid disorders, which can be treated with medication and surgery. (first)\nBenign goiter is a common thyroid disorder that can be treated with medication and surgery.\n\nCauses of benign goiter\nThere are many causes that affect the function or development of the thyroid gland leading to goiter.\nIodine deficiency: the most common cause of goiter worldwide is iodine deficiency, affecting 2.2 billion people globally. Iodine is necessary for thyroid hormone production. (2)\nIf a person does not ensure enough iodine in the diet, thyroid hormone production is reduced. At this time, the pituitary gland signals the thyroid gland to produce more hormones, affecting the thyroid structure.\nGraves' disease: an autoimmune disorder that occurs when the immune system produces a protein that mimics TSH (thyroid hormone), prompting the thyroid gland to produce too much hormone. This leads to hyperthyroidism and growth in thyroid size.; Thyroid nodules: due to uneven development of thyroid cells, forming tumors, most of which are benign. A person may have one or more thyroid nodules. The cause of thyroid nodules is unclear, but genetic factors are likely. In addition, diet and living environment also affect the formation of thyroid nodules; Pregnancy: during pregnancy, the mother's body produces gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) causing the thyroid gland to become overactive and slightly enlarged.; Thyroiditis: due to autoimmune disorders, bacterial infections, viruses or drugs that cause hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.\nBesides, risk factors leading to benign goiter include:\nWomen: more at risk of goiter or other thyroid disorders, especially women after 40 years old, during pregnancy and menopause, thyroid problems occur more often.; Family history: if someone in the family has goiter or thyroid disorder, the remaining people are at risk of goiter.; Medicines: some medical treatments (amiodarone, pacerone, lithobid...) increase the risk of benign goiter.; Radiation exposure: The risk of benign goiter increases if you have had radiation treatment to the neck or chest area.\n\nIs benign goiter dangerous?\nMost benign goiters are not dangerous. However, large benign goiters can also lead to neurological damage (phrenic nerve palsy, Horner syndrome and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy). These lesions will stop after thyroid surgery. In addition, the thyroid gland is too large and compresses the esophagus, making it difficult for the patient to swallow, affecting eating and lacking nutrients. (3)\nA large goiter compresses the esophagus, making it difficult for the patient to swallow, affecting eating.\nMaybe you need to know: Is goiter dangerous? When is treatment needed?\n\nSymptoms of benign goiter\nMost benign goiters have no signs or symptoms other than swelling in the neck. The degree of swelling and severity of symptoms caused by benign goiters vary from person to person.\nIn many cases, goiters are so small that they are only discovered when accidentally having a health check-up, testing, or taking a film. (4)\nBenign goiter symptoms also depend on whether thyroid function changes, the size of the benign goiter's growth, and whether it obstructs the respiratory organs or not. Sometimes the size or location of a benign goiter obstructs the airways and vocal cords, leading to: difficulty swallowing, coughing, difficulty breathing on exertion, hoarseness, snoring...\n\nDiagnosis method of benign goiter\nWhen there are signs of suspected goiter, the patient should register for an examination with a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology - Diabetes for an accurate diagnosis. At Tam Anh General Hospital system, doctors in the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes are proficient in professional knowledge and rich in practical experience, so they can accurately diagnose goiter.\nThe doctor feels and feels to see if there is swelling in the neck. He may ask the patient to swallow when he feels a goiter. The doctor can prescribe ultrasound and thyroid function tests to determine the size of the goiter, whether it is benign or malignant, hyperthyroidism, or hypothyroidism for appropriate treatment. In addition, if malignant goiter is suspected, the doctor will prescribe fluid aspiration and cell biopsy.\n\nTreatment of benign goiter\nDepending on the cause of benign goiter, doctors prescribe different treatments. Normally, with small goiters, normal thyroid function, no choking, difficulty breathing, etc., they will be monitored and examined periodically without treatment. As for large goiters, affecting thyroid function, causing difficulty swallowing, breathing... depending on the disease condition, the doctor of the Department of Endocrinology - Diabetes will prescribe medication (internal treatment), radiotherapy, surgery.\n\nHow to prevent benign goiter\nMost cases of benign goiter can be prevented with adequate dietary iodine. Specifically, patients need a diet full of sea fish, fish sauce, iodized salt... and avoid using cabbage, Chinese cabbage, and celery. People should practice a healthy lifestyle (don't stay up late, limit drinking alcohol, beer, smoking, exercise at least 30 minutes a day). Improving overall health and preventing many diseases: diabetes, goiter, hyperthyroidism...\n\nFrequently asked questions\n1. What should you do when detecting a benign goiter?\nWhen detecting a benign goiter, the patient should see a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology - Diabetes to monitor their health. Patients should follow the doctor's instructions for effective treatment.\n2. Should simple goiter be operated on?\nThe answer is no. Simple goiter (commonly known as benign goiter) is not dangerous. People with simple goiter can still live, work, and have children normally. Goiter can be treated by using medication, taking radiation... and adjusting the diet (supplementing foods rich in iodine such as seafood, oysters, clams, using iodized salt regularly).\n3. When should goiter surgery be performed?\nSurgery is the last resort when other methods have been tried but have failed. In particular, people with large goiters often have airway problems, which can complicate surgery. The trachea may be deviated, making intubation while anesthetizing the patient more difficult. The surgical process also has many potential risks: temporary or permanent hypocalcemia due to damage to the parathyroid gland, loss of a lot of blood, affecting the vocal cords causing the patient to become hoarse, mute, scarring in the front of the neck... (5 )\nSurgery is the last resort after other methods have been tried.\nTherefore, depending on the level and condition of the goiter, the Endocrinologist - Diabetes specialist will prescribe surgery. Normally, doctors will prescribe thyroid surgery when:\nTreatment with anti-thyroid drugs and oral radiation is ineffective, causing hyperthyroidism to recur.; Severely inflamed thyroid gland or large goiter (grade 2 - 3) has been treated with stable medical treatment (weight gain, no hand tremors, no nervousness, normal heart rate, rapid pulse).; Patients with eye problems or an overactive thyroid gland that affects the eyes.\nWith surgery, the doctor removes part or all of the thyroid gland. Therefore, the thyroid gland may no longer function or function poorly, so the patient is susceptible to hypothyroidism and needs continued treatment with thyroid hormone supplements.\nGoiter surgery is a difficult technique, requiring modern equipment, highly skilled and experienced surgeons and anesthesiologists. Large goiters cause many airway problems and can complicate surgery. The trachea may be deviated, making it difficult to intubate the patient to anesthetize the patient.\nTam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City is equipped with modern machinery and equipment and good, experienced, highly skilled doctors... helping patients feel secure and confident when coming for examination and treatment.\nBenign goiter does not have a major impact on health, however, patients need to have regular health check-ups and scheduled appointments with a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes for monitoring and ordering ultrasound and tests. when there is an abnormality (sudden increase in goiter size, pain...).",
