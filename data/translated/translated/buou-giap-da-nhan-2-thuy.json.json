    "content": "Bilobed multinodular goiter: Signs, causes and diagnosis\n\nBilobed multinodular goiter is the second cause of hyperthyroidism with symptoms: anxiety, sweating, fatigue, nervousness, palpitations, etc. At the same time, it can also lead to thyroid cancer. The disease rarely has symptoms, so people need to have regular health checks to detect and treat promptly, improving quality of life.\n\nWhat is bilobar multiple nodules?\nThe thyroid gland is located in the front of the neck, consisting of two lobes: the right lobe and the left lobe, connected by the thyroid isthmus, with the function of producing hormones to regulate metabolism, blood circulation, growth... Multiple thyroid nodules 2 Lobed is a condition in which both lobes of the thyroid gland have nodules. This condition may or may not affect thyroid function.\nMultiple thyroid nodules include 2 types:\nMultiple 2-lobed thyroid nodules are non-toxic: thyroid nodules only change the structure of the thyroid gland and do not affect hormone production function.; Toxic 2-lobe thyroid nodules: both change structure and affect thyroid function. Together with the thyroid gland, each thyroid nodule produces hormones, causing hyperthyroidism. Toxic multiple nodules are the second most common cause of hyperthyroidism, after Graves' disease (autoimmune disorder).\n\nCauses of 2-lobed multinodular goiter\nThe cause of multiple thyroid nodules in 2 lobes is still unknown; However, the following factors are considered to cause the disease: (1)\nLong-term iodine deficiency; Genetics cause the follicular cells of the thyroid gland to have inconsistent function; Women are more at risk of thyroid disease than men; During development, abnormalities in the structure and function of the thyroid gland occur.; An error occurs in the synthesis of thyroid hormones; Smoke.; Infection, thyroiditis.; Exposure to radioactive substances.\n\nSigns of multinodular goiter in 2 thyroid lobes\nBilobed multinodular goiter is often asymptomatic. The patient discovers it during a health check or has an ultrasound or test ordered for another disease; Sometimes due to multinodular goiter, the tumor appears in the front of the neck. Large goiters cause difficulty breathing, hoarseness, or a tight feeling around the throat. (2)\nPatients also discover 2-lobed multinodular goiter when they have symptoms of hyperthyroidism: weight loss, hand tremors, palpitations, anxiety...; Hypothyroidism: weight gain, dry skin, cold intolerance, constipation...\nSometimes patients discover multinodular goiter because the condition clearly shows the tumor in the front of the neck\n\nHow to diagnose multinodular thyroid goiter\n1. Physical examination\nWhen examined, the doctor will palpate the neck area to detect abnormalities such as tumors, cervical lymph nodes, etc. The doctor will also ask about your history of having ever had a goiter? Does anyone in your family have goiter? Have you ever had radiotherapy to the neck, head, or chest? In addition, the doctor will ask for information about: weight, hair loss, sweating, anxiety, palpitations, hand tremors...\n2. Ultrasound\nUltrasound is a commonly used method to examine the thyroid gland. Thereby, the doctor evaluates the size of the thyroid gland, the characteristics of thyroid nodules: quantity, calcification, contour, shape...\n3. Blood test\nBlood test to quantify thyroid hormones (TSH, FT3, FT4), assessing whether the thyroid gland is functioning normally. Based on the blood test results, the doctor also determined whether the 2-lobed multinodular goiter was toxic. From there, come up with a suitable treatment plan.\nMost patients with toxic bilobed multinodular goiter use radioactive iodine, except pregnant women.\n4. Biopsy\nWhen thyroid cancer is suspected, your doctor will prescribe a biopsy. The doctor uses a thin needle to poke the thyroid nodule with the help of ultrasound, takes the cells, and then sends them to the laboratory. Pathologists observe cells under a microscope. Biopsy results include the following cases:\nUnable to diagnose: due to not enough cells, need to be aspirated for re-biopsy.; Benign: most biopsy results are benign. Patients with benign results will continue to be monitored periodically every 6 months.; Malignant: the patient has cancer and needs total thyroid surgery; Indeterminate: about 15%-20% of biopsy results are indeterminate. This means that it is unlikely that these cells are cancerous, but that they are abnormal.\n\nTreatment of bilobed multinodular goiter of the thyroid gland\n1. Non-toxic treatment of 2-lobed multinodular thyroid gland\nNon-toxic bilobed multinodular goiter does not affect thyroid function, but patients need to be monitored periodically every 6 months or as prescribed by the doctor. Because goiter can turn toxic, causing thyroid cancer. In case of non-toxic multi-lobe goiter that is large in size and affects the breathing and swallowing process, the patient is advised to undergo enucleation surgery or use radioactive iodine. The dose of radioactive iodine is prescribed by the doctor of the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes. After using radioactive iodine, patients are susceptible to hypothyroidism, so they need to take thyroid hormone medication.\nIn addition, there is also a radiofrequency ablation method to treat 2-lobe multinodular goiter. Accordingly, the doctor uses high-frequency electric current to reduce the size of the nodules, leaving no scars, and preserving healthy thyroid tissue.\n2. Treatment of toxic 2-lobed multinodular thyroid\nToxic multinodular 2-lobed goiter will cause hyperthyroidism with symptoms: fatigue, anxiety, sweating, nervousness, palpitations, weight loss, insomnia, muscle weakness... Therefore, when detected, the person The disease needs to be treated promptly. Depending on the condition, the doctor will discuss with the patient to choose an appropriate and effective treatment plan. Treatment methods for 2-lobed multinodular goiter include: radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, and surgery.\nAntithyroid drugs: Thioamide is a group of antithyroid drugs commonly used to help thyroid function return to normal. Endocrinologists - Diabetics often use antithyroid drugs to prepare for surgery or use radioactive iodine. Patients take antithyroid medication for 2-8 weeks and stop taking medication at least 4 days before radioactive iodine treatment to avoid thyroid storm.\nAntithyroid drugs can cause side effects: fever, digestive disorders, leukopenia, liver damage... Therefore, doctors often prescribe the lowest dose of antithyroid drugs.\nThioamide is a group of antithyroid drugs commonly used to help thyroid function return to normal\nRadioactive iodine: Most patients with toxic 2-lobed multinodular goiter use radioactive iodine, except pregnant women. After treatment, if the goiter size increases or thyroid hormone levels are high, it shows that the iodine dose is not enough. Normally, iodine absorption in people with toxic multinodular thyroid goiter is worse than in people with Basedow's disease, so a higher dose of radioactive iodine is needed.\nBeta blockers: Effective in alleviating symptoms of toxic 2-lobed multinodular goiter such as tachycardia, hand tremors, sweating, nervousness, palpitations... If the patient does not respond or has side effects to the treatment. beta blockers, the doctor will replace it with calcium pills.\nTam Anh General Hospital system with a team of highly qualified and experienced Endocrinology and Diabetes doctors and medical equipment, Testing Center meeting ISO 15189:2012 standards, modern operating room is the place to examine, Effective treatment of endocrine diseases (goiter, hyperthyroidism, 2-lobed multinodular goiter, adrenal insufficiency...), diabetes (gestational diabetes, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes). People should go for regular checkups to detect diseases early, receive timely treatment, and improve quality of life.\nBilobed multinodular goiter needs to be monitored and treated, because it can lead to hyperthyroidism. At the same time, patients need to monitor 2-lobed multinodular goiter with an Endocrinologist - Diabetes doctor at a hospital with a modern testing center and top-notch equipment to get accurate results and quick diagnosis. , timely treatment.",
