    "content": "Multinodular goiter: Causes, signs and diagnosis\n\nMost multinodular goiters are benign and do not require treatment. However, in some cases, multinodular goiter is a risk factor for thyroid cancer. Therefore, people with multinodular goiter need regular health check-ups with doctors from the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes at a hospital with modern machinery and equipment. This helps patients get quick test results, accurate ultrasound and effective treatment.\n\nWhat is multinodular goiter?\nThe thyroid gland is butterfly-shaped, located in the front of the neck, producing hormones that control many functions in the body. Any increase in the size of all or part of the thyroid gland is called a goiter.\nMultinodular goiter (multinodular goiter) is a condition in which the goiter has many nodules (nodules). Enlarged nodules may be clearly visible or discovered incidentally during ultrasound. Multinodular goiter is associated with a higher risk of thyroid cancer. Therefore, when you have a multinodular goiter, your Endocrinologist - Diabetologist may prescribe thyroid cancer screening.\nMultinodular goiter and thyroid disease in general are more common in women than men, age > 50. Indications for treatment of multinodular goiter depend on whether the goiter causes hyperthyroidism, goiter size, and whether there is suspicion of malignancy. emptiness. In most cases, patients do not need treatment but must be periodically monitored by a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes.\n\nCause of multinodular goiter\nMost cases of multinodular goiter have unclear causes. Multinodular goiter can develop from simple goiter and diffuse goiter. Additionally, Hashimoto's thyroiditis (autoimmune thyroiditis) is associated with a higher risk of thyroid nodules. (first)\nSupplementing foods rich in iodine helps prevent multinodular goiter.\nRisk factors for the disease include: Iodine deficiency, female gender, older age and a family with multinodular goiter. Nodules in goiter are formed and develop at different speeds, combined with factors such as medication, diet, and genes. This process takes place over many years, so it is common to notice an increase in the number of people with multinodular goiter in middle age and older.\n\nSigns of multinodular thyroid goiter\nUsually, multinodular goiter causes no symptoms, is invisible and is only discovered when the patient has a regular health check-up. In many cases, multinodular goiter appears clearly as a tumor in the front of the neck, which can be seen immediately. Sometimes there are symptoms of an overactive (hyperthyroidism) or underactive (hypothyroidism) thyroid gland. Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) causes weight loss, tremors, palpitations, heat intolerance, sleep disorders, anxiety, etc. An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) may be associated with increased thyroid function. weight gain, dry skin, muscle cramps, cold intolerance, constipation,...\nWhen the goiter and nodules are large, it will cause difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, hoarseness or a feeling of tightness around the throat. Rarely, multinodular goiter causes pain and discomfort due to its unusually rapid increase in size.\n\nDiagnosis of multinodular thyroid goiter\nSee the doctor\nIn addition to asking about medical history and family factors, observe and touch the patient's neck. Your doctor will feel the size and shape of your thyroid.\nDoctor checks patient for goiter.\nBlood tests\nBlood test to quantify thyroid hormones (TSH, FT3, FT4), thyroid antibodies (Anti TPO). Through these indicators, the doctor will evaluate thyroid activity and provide appropriate treatment plans. Even based on the blood test results, the doctor will prescribe other testing methods: neck ultrasound, CT scan, etc. to accurately diagnose the patient's condition.\nImage analysation\nUltrasound is the best method to examine the thyroid gland, helping doctors evaluate the size of the thyroid gland and the characteristics of thyroid nodules: Size, quantity, calcification, echogenicity, contour, shape, solid or cystic form. Therefore, after clinical examination and assessment, the doctor of the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes will assign the patient to have a thyroid ultrasound.\nBiopsy\nIf any nodules are suspicious for thyroid cancer, your doctor will prescribe a fine-needle aspiration biopsy. The doctor uses a very thin needle to take cells from some thyroid nodules and send them to the laboratory to have them biopsied to see if they are cancerous or not. To get accurate results, patients should be examined and biopsied at a hospital with an Endocrinology - Diabetes department with highly specialized, experienced doctors and modern equipment.\nThe Pathologist will observe the cells under a microscope. A biopsy will give 4 results:\nNon-diagnostic: Means there are not enough cells to confirm the diagnosis. In this case, a repeat biopsy will be indicated.; Benign: Most patients have benign biopsy results and continue to be monitored periodically every 6 months. Benign multinodular goiter can still be operated on if the size of the nodules is large, causing symptoms of difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, and loss of aesthetics.; Malignant: Usually papillary thyroid cancer, the patient undergoes surgery to remove the entire thyroid gland.; Unknown: Includes: Cystic lesions, cystic tumors, Hurthle cell lesions (a type of thyroid cell), atypical cells or tumors. This means that it is uncertain whether the cells are cancerous or not, but they are abnormal. Up to 15%-20% of FNA results (fine needle aspiration of thyroid cells) come back in this form.\n\nTreatment of multinodular goiter\nMost multinodular goiters are benign and do not require medical treatment, but you must have regular check-ups with a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes for monitoring and early detection of abnormalities. If a toxic multinodular goiter (produces too much thyroid hormone leading to hyperthyroidism), compresses the larynx, esophagus, or trachea, causing difficulty swallowing or breathing, the doctor will recommend treatment options to ensure safety. all for the patient.\nDepending on the size, number of thyroid nodules, whether there are toxic nodules, or whether there is cancer... the Endocrinologist - Diabetes Doctor will prescribe partial or complete removal of the thyroid gland.\nTreatment methods for multinodular goiter include: Antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine or surgery. Depending on each patient's condition, the doctor advises on the optimal solution, even combining all 3 methods for effectiveness.\nRadioactive iodine method: Works by partially destroying the thyroid gland, helping to shrink the thyroid gland. The patient drinks a glass of water containing the dose of iodine as prescribed by the Endocrinologist - Diabetic, the thyroid cells will absorb the iodine and be destroyed. The thyroid gland can return to normal hormone production, but many cases of hypothyroidism require continued treatment with hormone medication.\nWith the antithyroid drugs methimazole and propylthiouracil, patients must use them for a long time, side effects may occur such as granulocytopenia, hepatotoxicity, vasculitis...\nWith surgical method: Depending on the size, number of thyroid nodules, whether there are toxic nodules, whether there is cancer, etc., there will be indications to remove part or all of the thyroid gland. In particular, if cancerous thyroid nodules are detected, surgery is the preferred method. If the entire thyroid gland is removed, the patient will need to take thyroid hormone replacement medication for life.\n\nFrequently asked questions about multinodular goiter\nDoes the treatment have side effects?\nAntithyroid drugs are often used to treat overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), toxic multinodular goiter, and hyperthyroid women during pregnancy. The drug works to block the production of thyroid hormones. It is also used for short-term treatment of hyperthyroidism in preparation for thyroid surgery or radioactive iodine.\nMild side effects: 15% of people taking antithyroid drugs have mild side effects. Both methimazole and propylthiouracil can cause itching, rash, hives, swelling and joint pain, fever, changes in appetite, nausea and vomiting. If side effects occur, the doctor may advise the patient to switch to another medication or change treatment methods. However, about half of people who have side effects with one drug will have similar side effects with the other drug.\nSevere side effects: rare, but still be careful when using antithyroid drugs, including:\nLeukocyte atrophy (granulocytes < 500/uL) is a severe decrease in the production of white blood cells. This condition is very serious but only affects 1 in 200 â€“ 500 people taking antithyroid drugs. Older adults taking propylthiouracil and people taking high doses of methimazole are at greater risk of this side effect.\nGranulocytopenia usually occurs during the first 3 months of taking antithyroid drugs. If the patient has a sore throat, fever, or other symptoms of infection, they should stop taking the medicine and see an Endocrinologist - Diabetician for a general blood count test. Because the infection is serious, it can be life-threatening, even fatal.\nLiver damage: Rare side effects when taking antithyroid drugs, especially propylthiouracil. Liver damage associated with propylthiouracil use usually occurs within 3 months of starting the drug. If the patient has jaundice, dark urine, pale stools, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea or other symptoms of liver dysfunction, the drug should be stopped immediately. The patient goes to see an Endocrinologist - Diabetic to have liver function assessed. Liver failure associated with propylthiouracil can be severe and life-threatening.\nWhat are the long-term effects of multinodular goiter?\nMultinodular goiters are usually benign and do not cause any symptoms until they grow larger, form a lump in the front of the neck, and cause difficulty breathing and swallowing. However, even if treatment is not needed, the patient must have regular check-ups with a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes to check and consider the size of thyroid nodules and whether they are toxic or not for effective treatment and to limit the effects. to quality of life and overall health.\nIs multinodular goiter hereditary?\nMultinodular goiter can be hereditary. Evidence shows that one family member with multinodular goiter increases the likelihood of other family members having the disease. Therefore, family members who have a goiter (goiter), multinodular goiter, diffuse goiter, Basedow's goiter... should have regular health check-ups with an Endocrinologist - Diabetes doctor, thereby Detect abnormalities (if any) and choose effective treatment methods.\nMost multinodular goiters are benign and do not require treatment, but in many cases they are a risk factor for thyroid cancer. People need to have regular health checks to detect diseases. For people with multinodular goiter, it is necessary to see an Endocrinologist - Diabetes specialist at a hospital with modern machinery and equipment to get accurate test results and effective treatment.",
