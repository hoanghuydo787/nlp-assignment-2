    "content": "Colloid goiter: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment\n\nColloid goiter is a common thyroid disease, often detected during a physical examination or thyroid ultrasound. The disease occurs more often in women than men, with a ratio of 4/1.\n\nWhat is colloid goiter?\nColloid goiter is a condition in which the thyroid gland is enlarged without thyroid dysfunction. The goiter contains colloid fluid inside. The disease occurs when the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones to meet the body's metabolic needs. At this time, the thyroid gland compensates by expanding, overcoming mild thyroid hormone deficiency. (first)\nColloid goiter has a diffuse and nodular form.\nColloid goiter is also known as endemic goiter, thyroid colloid cystic goiter, simple goiter, nontoxic single-nodular goiter, nontoxic multinodular goiter or nodular hyperplastic goiter. Although it has many names, it is generally a benign condition. However, on ultrasound images it can appear like malignant lesions.\n\nCause of thyroid colloid goiter\nThe main cause is insufficient iodine in the diet, which often occurs in some iodine-deficient geographical areas (far from coastal areas). In an area where goiter is endemic, more than 10% of children aged 6 - 12 years old are affected.\nIn addition, the cause of the disease also comes from other disorders in the body, using drugs, eating a lot of foods containing goitrogens (such as cassava, cabbage, chayote, ...).\n\nSubjects susceptible to thyroid colloid goiter\nRisk factors include:Â (2)\nFemale; People over 40 years old; Insufficient iodine in the diet; Living in an endemic area; Have a family history of goiter\n\nSymptoms of colloid goiter\nThyroid enlargement (may vary from a single small nodule to larger); Difficulty breathing due to tracheal compression (rare); Difficulty swallowing due to esophageal compression (rare); Jugular vein aneurysm; Feeling dizzy when raising your arms above your head (large goiter)\n\nIs colloid goiter dangerous?\nAre not! Colloid goiter is a common and benign disease. The disease can be cured by changing eating habits (using foods containing iodine (salt, fish sauce...)/ iodine supplementation as prescribed by an Endocrinologist) or surgery (when there are difficult symptoms). swallowing, difficulty breathing due to tracheal compression...). Therefore, this group of people should maintain annual health check-ups; Regular screening or examination to detect disease (if any) or prevent the disease from progressing seriously.\nProgressive enlargement of the thyroid gland or the development of hard (dominant or enlarged) nodules may be a sign of malignant (cancerous) thyroid disease. Patients need to go to the doctor for a fine needle biopsy to rule out malignant causes.\nOther complications include: simple goiter progressing to toxic nodular goiter; thyrotoxicosis (occurs spontaneously when the thyroid gland is re-exposed to iodine); Hypoparathyroidism and recurrent laryngeal nerve damage can occur during or after thyroidectomy; Patients after total thyroidectomy need to supplement thyroid supplements for life...\n\nMethod for diagnosing colloid goiter\nAbnormalities of the thyroid gland can be detected through medical examination (seeing, touching, listening, or some special tests), or detected early through regular health examinations. Your doctor may then use a number of tests to diagnose and evaluate goiter.\nDiagnosis of colloid goiter through tests\nDiagnostic methods include:\nThyroid ultrasound: Through this technique, the doctor can \"see\" the thyroid gland, know its size, and see whether or not colloid goiters and goiters are diffuse or nodular.; Thyroid scan: Technique that examines the size, shape and location of the thyroid gland; overactive or underactive thyroid areas; Cyst aspiration: The patient will have a fine needle biopsy (FNA) of the thyroid gland performed. The technician will take a tissue/cell sample, then examine it under a laboratory microscope. This technique is done to eliminate cancer.; Antibody test: Through a blood test, it is possible to find abnormal antibodies (a protein produced by white blood cells) that cause goiter.; Hormone testing: Looks at the amount of hormones produced by the thyroid and pituitary glands. Hormone levels that are too low or too high can also cause the disease.; Thyroid scan: A small amount of radioactive isotope is injected into a vein so that an image of the thyroid appears clearly on a computer screen. Through the images obtained, the doctor will know the size and function of the thyroid gland. However, this technique is only necessary in certain cases.\n\nHow to treat colloid goiter\nAppropriate goiter treatment methods need to be based on the size, cause, duration of the disease and the patient's health. The goal of treatment is to reduce the size of the goiter and maintain normal thyroid function. (3)\nSupplement iodized salt for people with acacia goiter as prescribed by the doctor to maintain a healthy thyroid\nCommon methods of treating colloid goiter are: iodine supplementation, use of thyroid hormones, and thyroid surgery. Specifically:\n1. Iodine supplementation\nApplicable to patients with colloid goiter due to iodine deficiency but thyroid function is normal. Iodine supplementation (Lugol's solution containing iodine salts) is a simple method but clearly effective in shrinking new colloid goiters. Treatment duration as prescribed by the doctor (usually 6 months or more).\nHowever, some complications of hyperthyroidism can occur when using this treatment. Therefore, patients should return for follow-up appointments or when any unusual symptoms occur. Patients need to follow the doctor's prescriptions and should not use iodine supplements to avoid overdose.\n2. Use thyroid hormone\nWhen patients have colloid goiter due to thyroid hormone deficiency and iodine deficiency, they need treatment using thyroid hormone. Medicines that patients can use include Thyroxin (Levothyroxine, L-Thyroxine, Levothyrox), Triiodothyronine (Liothyronine)... with dosage and duration as prescribed by the doctor. After a period of 8-10 months of taking the drug, the size of the goiter can be reduced by about 40-60%, and the thyroid function can function normally.\nWhile taking the drug, the patient will have periodic blood tests to measure the concentration of hormones T3, T4, FT3, FT4 and TSH to monitor treatment effectiveness, adjust drug dosage, and prevent toxicity.\nHowever, the drug is also contraindicated for people with myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, angina, hyperthyroidism, osteoporosis, etc. In addition, some side effects may occur such as nausea, increased sweating, hot flashes, weight loss, osteoporosis; Rarer conditions include insomnia, weight gain, angina, allergies...\n3. Thyroid surgery\nFor people with colloid goiter, the thyroid gland enlarges and works more than usual to compensate for the iodine/hormone deficiency. At this time, surgery can affect thyroid function. Therefore, the doctor does not prescribe surgery for the patient.\nNormally, thyroid surgery is indicated for the following cases: the patient falls into a state of choking, difficulty breathing, and hoarse speech due to pressure from the goiter; Patients with long-standing colloid goiter, risk/suspected of cancer, bleeding goiter; Enlarged goiter causing loss of aesthetics (patient wishes to have surgery).\nColloid goiter surgery is not too complicated. The patient can be discharged from the hospital after a few days if there are no complications (bleeding, infection); Hoarseness of speech (can recover after a while); hypothyroidism; Goiter recurrence (due to incomplete treatment of the cause of the goiter).\nTo get advice and book an appointment with leading endocrinology and diabetes experts at Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nTo prevent colloid goiter, make sure your diet contains enough iodine for your body. The recommended iodine intake is 150 mcg/day. The simple way is to use iodized salt in cooking; Diverse meal menu including fish, shellfish, beef, chicken, milk... Store iodized salt in a sealed jar, keep it in a cool place, avoid direct sunlight or keep it too close to the stove to ensure effectiveness. highest disease prevention results.",
