    "content": "Diffuse goiter: Classification, causes and prevention\n\nMost diffuse goiters are benign. There are also many cases of toxic diffuse goiter (also known as Basedow's disease). Therefore, when there are signs of goiter, patients need to see a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology - Diabetes to monitor, promptly detect complications and plan effective treatment.\n\nWhat is diffuse goiter?\nGoiter is a condition in which the thyroid gland is enlarged. If the thyroid gland is evenly enlarged (both sides), it is called a diffuse goiter. Most diffuse goiters are benign and not life-threatening. However, if not examined and monitored regularly, diffuse goiter can cause many complications: arrhythmia, blurred vision, bulging eyes, etc. There are two types of diffuse goiter: non-toxic diffuse goiter and goiter. diffuse thyroid toxicity. (first)\n\nCommon types of diffuse goiter\n1. Non-toxic diffuse goiter (benign diffuse goiter)\nNon-toxic diffuse goiter is an enlarged thyroid gland without thyroid dysfunction, and can be diffuse or develop locally. If the goiter is large, it will extend into the retrosacral space. Due to limited space in the mediastinum, goiter causes compression on the upper trachea, laryngeal nerve and esophagus.\nDiffuse goiter is a condition in which the thyroid gland is enlarged on both sides\n2. Diffuse toxic goiter (also known as Basedow)\nBasedow's toxic diffuse goiter is hyperthyroidism combined with diffuse hypertrophic goiter. The disease can be caused by infection, genetics, mental trauma, etc. The basic cause of the mechanism leading to Basedow's disease is increased thyroid hormone secretion. Symptoms of Basedow's disease vary depending on age:\nIn children and adults: the thyroid gland is quite large, the clinical course has many different characteristics from adults. The patient is forgetful, has headaches, loses concentration, height is reduced, and genitals do not develop. There are also cases of children suffering from acute thyrotoxicosis. Children rarely have symptoms of heart failure, digestive disorders, etc.; In the elderly: the first symptoms of the disease are cardiovascular disorders, heart failure, precordial pain, etc. Moderately enlarged thyroid gland, mixed goiter (both diffuse and nodular), eye symptoms unclear, uncharacteristic hand tremor.\nDiagnosis of diffuse, toxic goiter requires a combination of clinical and laboratory signs. In particular, X-rays and blood tests are very important to draw conclusions about the underlying cause of the disease. After being diagnosed, based on medical records, the doctor will advise on the side effects of each treatment method for the patient to choose. (2)\n\nCause of diffuse goiter\nAbnormalities of iodine supply or metabolism always lead to goiter. Thyroid hormones are synthesized from iodine. Iodine is found in food and soil. In mountainous areas and rainy environments, iodine is washed out of the soil, leaving food with little or no iodine. This explains why residents of mountainous areas have a higher risk of goiter due to a diet low in iodine. (3)\nAbnormalities of iodine supply or metabolism are the cause of goiter.\nAlthough it is not dangerous, patients need to have regular health check-ups with a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes to detect bad developments early. Because in the long term, benign diffuse goiter has the risk of leading to hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (toxic goiter).\n\nHow to treat diffuse thyroid goiter\nMost diffuse goiters are benign. Small diffuse goiters often have no symptoms and do not require treatment, but must be periodically monitored by a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes.\nFor simply large diffuse goiters that compress the trachea and esophagus, causing difficulty swallowing, breathing, etc., they are treated with Levothyroxine at a dose that suppresses TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) to a low level to shrink the goiter. . If symptoms do not improve or cause cosmetic loss, the doctor may recommend surgery.\nWith toxic diffuse goiter (Basedow), patients are given antithyroid drugs (ATD): propylthiouracil, thiamazole and carbimazole; Radioactive iodine, surgery.\n1. Antithyroid drugs\nThe Thyroid Association and the American Society of Clinical Endocrinology recommend thiamazole as the preferred drug for Basedow's disease (except in patients with adverse reactions to the drug or in the first trimester of pregnancy). Thiamazole is more effective than propylthiouracil, with a longer half-life and duration of action.\nThere are two antithyroid drug regimens. First regimen: ATD dose is gradually reduced to the lowest possible dose until the desired thyroid state is achieved. Next regimen: use high doses of ATD supplemented with thyroxine (T4 – thyroid hormone) to maintain thyroid status.\nUsing antithyroid drugs is one of the methods of treating toxic diffuse goiter (Basedow).\nAntithyroid drug therapy has a 50-55% risk of disease recurrence, especially in the first year after stopping treatment. Patients are susceptible to poor prognostic factors: severe hyperthyroidism, large goiter, etc. Rare side effects of antithyroid drug therapy include: agranulocytosis, hepatotoxicity, vasculitis,… (4)\n2. Radioactive iodine\nRadioactive iodine is the most common modality used to treat toxic diffuse goiter safely and effectively; taken in liquid or capsule form. The dose of radioactive iodine is adjusted by the doctor to suit the patient based on the volume of the thyroid gland and iodine absorption, etc. The patient must stop all iodine-containing medications and foods. Use an iodine-restricted diet to ensure effective absorption of radioactive iodine. If the patient has previously taken antithyroid drugs, when using radioactive iodine, the antithyroid drug must be stopped. After 1 week, you can use it again.\nSide effects of radioactive iodine therapy include: hypothyroidism, exacerbation of thyroid eye disease. Therefore, after using radioactive iodine, the patient must be monitored by a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology - Diabetes to control hypothyroidism and promptly treated with thyroid hormone medication.\nNote: Patients who are pregnant, breast-feeding, and have uncontrolled severe thyrotoxicosis... should not use this method.\n3. Surgery\nThyroid surgery is the most successful treatment for toxic diffuse goiter. Even removing the entire thyroid gland is more successful. However, besides the side effects of hypothyroidism, surgery has many other potential risks: laryngeal nerve paralysis leading to hoarseness, muteness, surgical scars, etc. Therefore, surgery is often indicated last. when the methods of using antithyroid drugs and radioactive iodine are not effective.\n\nDangerous complications of diffuse thyroid goiter\n1. Compression causes varicose veins\nLarge goiters cause varicose veins, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing. Even a large goiter makes the patient feel heavy in the front of the neck and affects aesthetics.\n2. Bacterial infection\nWhen infected, the goiter is hard, red, hot, etc., the patient may have a fever, which occurs when the goiter is not taken care of properly or eats an unhealthy diet.\n3. Hemorrhage\nThyroid bleeding occurs due to dystrophy. The tumor is large, slightly painful, and feels tight to the touch. During aspiration, uncoagulated blood appeared.\n3. Hyperthyroidism\nCommon in people with Basedow's disease, long-term goiter due to prolonged thyroid hormone excess without treatment,... with symptoms of heart arrhythmia, nervousness, muscle fatigue, hand tremors, weak limbs,...\n5. Hypothyroidism\nDiffuse toxic goiter can progress to hypothyroidism in the natural course of the disease regardless of treatment with symptoms: loss of appetite, memory loss, hoarse and deeper voice, weight gain, constipation. fertilizer,… (5)\n6. Goiter cancer\nA single nodule in a goiter can develop into cancer. The tumor grows rapidly, causing compression of other organs in the neck: vocal cords, trachea, etc.\n\nHow to prevent diffuse goiter\n1. Control the amount of iodine in your daily diet\nDiet and nutrients play a very important role in preventing diffuse goiter as well as many other diseases: diabetes, cardiovascular disease, blood pressure, kidney disease, etc. To prevent goiter, besides Balanced nutrition, patients need to supplement adequate iodine in accordance with the body's needs. According to WHO recommendations, iodine intake depends on age and physical condition. Specifically:\nAge group Iodine requirement (mcg/day) Age group Iodine requirement (mcg/day) Infants (Months old) 0-5 90 Adult males (Over 19 years old) 150 6-11 90 Children (Five years old) 1-6 90 Adult female (Over 19 years old) 150 7/9 120 Adolescent male (Years old) 10-12 120 Pregnant woman (During period) 200 13-18 150 Female adolescent (Years age 10-12 120 Breastfeeding mother (During period) 200 13-18 150\nThe easiest way to supplement your body with enough iodine is to use iodized salt in your daily diet. It is necessary to distinguish between sea salt and iodized salt. 100 grams of sea salt only contains 20 mcg of iodine, so it does not meet the body's need for iodine. Meanwhile, 1 gram of iodized salt contains about 45 mcg of iodine. With 1 teaspoon of salt, about 5.69g, more than 220 mcg of iodine is added.\n2. Nutrition for people with diffuse goiter\nFor people with diffuse goiter, it is not toxic\nFor people with non-toxic diffuse goiter, the patient should eat a lot of vegetables, providing enough iodine for the body: seaweed, seafood, fish, dark green vegetables, carrots, sweet potatoes, fruits. trees (oranges, tangerines, etc.). Limit your intake of processed foods.\nFor people with toxic diffuse goiter\nPeople with toxic diffuse goiter should eat foods rich in protein, zinc, calcium, vitamin A, vitamin E, etc. to avoid weakness and health deterioration. When choosing foods, choose foods with a low glycemic index (below 55). Some suggested foods: lean pork, brown rice, whole grains, cauliflower, kale, cabbage, radishes, amaranth, carrots, bananas, kiwi, oranges, apples, carrots, Papaya, mango,... Do not eat red meat (beef, buffalo meat, lamb,...), milk and dairy products (cheese, yogurt, whey,...), sugar and foods high in sugar (cakes, carbonated drinks,...), spicy, hot spices, stimulants, alcoholic drinks.\nAlthough diffuse goiter is a benign disease, there are also many cases of toxicity. Therefore, when there are signs of diffuse goiter, the patient needs to see a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology - Diabetes to monitor, promptly detect dangerous complications and plan appropriate treatment. .",
