    "content": "Right lobe goiter: Causes, diagnosis and treatment\n\nRight lobe goiter is a condition in which enlarged nodules or tumors appear in the right lobe of the thyroid gland, also known as thyroid nodules. Thyroid nodules can be malignant and benign. The rate of women with right lobe goiter is higher than that of men.\n\nWhat is right lobe goiter?\nThe thyroid is a butterfly-shaped endocrine gland about 5cm long located under the neck, with a weight of 10-20 grams. The thyroid gland has 2 lobes: left lobe and right lobe. The thyroid gland plays an important role in the body, responsible for releasing hormones that control metabolism. Hormones secreted by the thyroid gland regulate many body functions including: heart rate, breathing, body temperature, nervous system function. (first)\nRight lobe goiter is a goiter located in the right lobe of the thyroid gland, with one or more enlarged nodules. Right lobe goiter is quite common, with up to ⅓ of women and ⅕ of men affected. This tumor is usually benign, less than 5% of cancer cases (2). Therefore, testing is needed to determine whether thyroid nodules are malignant or not.\nWhen the thyroid gland is damaged, it will affect the organs in the body. However, if you have a right lobe goiter, the thyroid gland can still continue to function well and produce enough hormones for the body. In fact, most cases of right lobe goiter do not affect health much. However, this could be a sign of thyroid disease.\nWomen have a higher risk of right lobe goiter than men.\n\nCauses of right lobe thyroid nodules\nThe majority of cases of right lobe goiter are due to the following problems: (3)\nIneffective thyroid hormone production: when the thyroid gland cannot produce enough thyroid hormone, it compensates by enlarging. A common cause of ineffective thyroid function is iodine deficiency. Some other causes include: radiation exposure, genetics...; Thyroiditis: Thyroiditis causes swelling of the thyroid gland, creating large, tumor-like nodules in the neck. The common cause of thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which occurs when the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, causing inflammation. Children with Hashimoto's thyroiditis have a higher risk of right lobe goiter. In addition, another common cause is postpartum thyroiditis, about 5% of women have postpartum thyroiditis. Some cases of thyroiditis are caused by side effects of medication.; Thyroid tumors: Thyroid tumors are usually benign but can be cancerous. Most tumors are enlarged nodules, which may appear as generalized glandular swelling.; Iodine deficiency: Iodine plays a role in helping the thyroid gland produce thyroid hormones. Iodine deficiency in the diet is the main cause of goiter and right lobe goiter.\n\nSymptoms of right lobe goiter\nRight lobe goiter often has no obvious symptoms until the goiter becomes large or has a regular health check-up. When the nodules grow larger, symptoms will become more obvious. The easily recognizable symptom is the appearance of a tumor on the right side of the neck. In addition, the patient feels heavy, has difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, hoarseness, and neck pain. (4)\nRarely, thyroid nodules produce too much thyroid hormone (T3 and T4) causing symptoms of hyperthyroidism including: anxiety, irritability, moodiness, hyperactivity, sweating, poor heat tolerance, heart failure. rapid heartbeat, shaking hands, hair loss, diarrhea, weight loss, irregular menstrual cycle.\nEnlarged nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland.\n\nHow to diagnose right lobe goiter\nWhen right lobe goiter is suspected, the doctor will check by looking or touching the thyroid gland. When a nodule is discovered, the immediate question is: is the thyroid nodule benign or malignant? Do nodules produce too much thyroid hormone? Is it related to the cervical lymph nodes? To solve the above problems, the doctor will prescribe the patient the following diagnoses: (5)\nUltrasound: helps the doctor determine the location and characteristics of thyroid nodules. Ultrasound of lymph nodes in the neck to determine whether there is cancer or not; Blood test: measures hormone levels T3 and T4 (thyroid hormones) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Blood tests help determine whether thyroid nodules are producing too much thyroid hormone, which can cause hyperthyroidism.; Biopsy: depends on the size of the nodule and the characteristics of shape, border, and density. A fine needle biopsy (FNA) may be performed. Use a small needle to take a sample of cells or fluid from the nodule. Then, examine under a microscope to determine whether the nodule is benign or malignant.\n\nTreatment of right lobe thyroid nodules\nRight lobe goiter is divided into 3 types for treatment: benign goiter, malignant goiter, and right lobe goiter that secretes too much hormone. (6) (7) (8)\nTreatment of benign goiter: most patients with benign right lobe goiter do not need specific treatment. The doctor will prescribe medication to prevent the growth or reduce the size of the nodules. Benign right lobe goiter is indicated for removal when the patient has the following factors: male under 40 years old, has had head or neck radiation therapy, has enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, has problems with speaking and swallowing, and has a history of Someone in the family has thyroid cancer. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is often used for benign tumors. Radiofrequency ablation uses a probe to reach the tumor, then treats it with electric current and heat to shrink the tumor.; Treatment of malignant goiter: For people with malignant right lobe goiter, the entire thyroid gland needs to be removed. The lymph nodes in the neck are examined to determine whether the tumor has spread or not. Further treatment depends on the findings at surgery. Some patients can have thyroid hormones placed and monitor blood tests and ultrasounds. While other cases will receive radioactive iodine to destroy remaining thyroid tissue, followed by blood tests and ultrasound.; Treatment of thyroid nodules that secrete too much hormone: treated in many ways including radioactive iodine, removing nodules with alcohol or surgical excision. Radioactive iodine taken in pill form causes the thyroid gland to shrink making less thyroid hormone. Radioactive iodine is absorbed only by the thyroid gland, so it does not harm other cells. Alcohol thyroidectomy involves injecting alcohol into the thyroid nodules through a small needle, causing the nodules to shrink and produce less thyroid hormone.\nGet your thyroid checked regularly.\n\nIs right lobe goiter dangerous?\nRight lobe goiter is over 95% benign and does not affect health much. However, 5% of right lobe goiters are malignant, patients should have a biopsy and check the condition of the goiter. Thyroid cancer is one of the easiest types of cancer to treat. The common method of treating thyroid cancer is surgery to remove the thyroid gland. The cancer recurs and spreads to other cells in a small percentage. People who have had thyroidectomy can use thyroid hormones from outside. At Tam Anh General Hospital, there are many good experts in endocrine disease treatment and a modern machinery system, patients are treated according to individualized regimens with high results. (9)\nIf thyroid cancer is detected early, treatment results will be better. Therefore, when you notice abnormalities in the thyroid gland, you need to see an Endocrinologist for examination. Or have regular health check-ups to check thyroid status.\n\nMonitor the progression of right lobe goiter\nPeople with right lobe goiter who are being treated with medication or have had surgery need to have regular check-ups as prescribed by their doctor. For benign tumors that do not require surgery, long-term monitoring is required. If the tumor does not increase in size, monitoring is required for 3 - 5 years. For patients after thyroidectomy, it is necessary to monitor and strictly follow the doctor's instructions regarding medication, diet, exercise regimen, and periodic follow-up visits.\nAlthough right lobe goiter does not affect health much, 5% of cases still have malignant goiter. Therefore, if there are signs of abnormalities in the thyroid gland, you need to see an Endocrinologist for timely examination and detection. Early treatment of right lobe goiter helps prevent dangerous complications.",
