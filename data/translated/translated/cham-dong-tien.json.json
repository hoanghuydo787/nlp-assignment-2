    "content": "Nummular eczema: Causes, signs, diagnosis, prevention\n\nMs. N.T.T.T. (born in 1968, Tan Binh District, Ho Chi Minh City) went to Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City for a dermatological examination because his neck and arms had circular red patches, with a radius of about 2cm, around the red patches were pimples. Tiny water and yellow scales. Patients itch a lot. Dr. Dang Thi Ngoc Bich, Dermatology specialist, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, said that Ms. T. has nummular eczema, which is one of the common types of eczema. Nummular eczema is a chronic skin disease that causes coin-like round spots, blisters, itching, sometimes fluid, and can crust over. The disease can be well controlled and flare-ups prevented if treatment is followed.\n\nWhat is coin indigo?\nNummular eczema (English name Nummular Eczema) (1)  also known as nummular dermatitis or discoid eczema. The disease is manifested by round or oval papules that cause itching and swelling, then cracking, some with yellow blisters and scabs.\nNummular eczema causes skin damage, so it is easily mistaken for ringworm or nummular eczema. If left untreated for a long time, the disease lasts from month to month. The disease recurs  at the same location.\nMeanwhile, ringworm (Tinea Corporis) also tends to appear itchy bumps, turning into circular patches with scales around them, the skin in the center of the circle is more obvious.\nRingworm patches can be red or pink on fair skin, and brown and gray on darker skin. Excessive itching and scratching causes ringworm patches to grow larger. When treating ringworm patches, they tend to heal from the center of the circle first.\nThe coin-shaped red patch on Ms. T's hand.\n\nSymptoms of nummular eczema\nNummular eczema can appear on any part of the body, but is  rarely seen on the face and scalp. The initial signs of eczema are red, swollen bumps like insect bites, causing severe itching and blistering covered with tiny blisters. The nodules quickly join together to form large patches ranging in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters.\nThe patient feels itchy a lot at night. Over time, the dry patches become scaly and peeling, become rough, swollen, soft or painful, and the skin in between the patches is often dry, wrinkled, and red. (2)\n\nCauses of nummular eczema\nThe exact cause of nummular eczema has not yet been found, however nummular eczema patients are often related to the following factors:\nAllergy.; Bacterial infection (Staphylococcus...); Contact with rough fabrics.; Dry skin or sitting a lot in cold, dry environments; Or take a hot bath.; Skin injuries such as burns, scratches, insect stings; Using irritating soap dries out the skin.\n\nRisk factors that increase the likelihood of getting nummular eczema\nPeople at high risk of nummular eczema include:\nEat a lot of foods high in saturated fat such as: animal fat, red meat, poultry skin, cheese, butter, eggs, milk, cooking oil, fried foods, fast food...; Foods high in sugar include candy, processed foods, etc.; People who stay for a long time in dry and cold environments; Skin is often dry and cracked; Skin damage caused by insect bites, allergies, or burns; People who have had other types of eczema or dermatitis; People with anemia or leg swelling; People who regularly use interferon, ribavirin, and statin drugs are at high risk of developing nummular eczema.\n\nIs coin eczema dangerous?\nNummular eczema appears in both adults and children. Although it does not cause life-threatening complications, it greatly affects the health and spirit of the patient. Complications of nummular eczema include:\nCauses severe itching, especially at night, making it difficult to sleep, inconvenient for patients in daily activities, and reduced quality of life.; Infection: the skin is weakened due to many scaly and oozing wound patches. Patients may face a high risk of severe skin infections causing impetigo lesions, pus discharge, and thicker scabs.; Post-inflammatory skin pigmentation disorders, including erythema, hypo- or hyperpigmentation.\nNummular eczema can develop into large patches.\n\nIs nummular eczema contagious?\nNummular eczema occurs during daily activities, the skin area is vulnerable, easily leaks pus or secretes clear fluid. Therefore, many people worry that if they come into contact with the epidemic, they will be infected. In fact, nummular eczema is not contagious because the cause of the disease is due to internal factors and the body naturally arises such as: genetics, allergic constitution, weak immune system, excretory system disorders, stress...\nThe second group is influenced by environmental factors including: staying for a long time in a cold and dry environment, insect bites, exposure to toxic chemicals such as cigarette smoke, detergents, and use of drugs containing ingredients such as isotretinoin, interferon.\nBecause nummular eczema is not spread from person to person. You can feel secure in taking care of or having close contact with people with eczema.\n\nDiagnostic method\nTo diagnose nummular eczema, your doctor will examine the bumps or patches on your skin. The doctor examines the skin using experience and in-depth knowledge along with supporting tools such as lamps and magnifying glasses. The patient is then examined for fungi to determine whether the nodules are caused by bacteria or fungi.\nFor an accurate diagnosis, a skin biopsy is needed, but this is not necessary because it will leave scars on the skin. If bacteria and yeast are not detected, the patient is diagnosed with nummular eczema and has an appropriate treatment regimen.\n\nHow to treat nummular eczema syndrome\nNummular eczema is a chronic disease, so the goal of treatment  is to reduce discomfort and complications. To support the treatment of nummular eczema, patients can apply the following measures:\nMoisturize the skin: dry skin is one of the causes of nummular eczema, so patients need to moisturize their skin regularly with moisturizer.

All of these medications can reduce inflammation and itching. For best results, apply immediately after bathing.; For large nodules and widespread eczema patches that cause severe itching and hyperkeratosis, corticosteroid injections and cryotherapy may be needed; In case the patient has severe itching that causes difficulty sleeping, the doctor will prescribe antihistamines that have a drowsy effect. Lack of sleep makes skin conditions worse.\n\nHow to prevent nummular eczema\nTo prevent the risk of eczema outbreaks, patients should note the following:\nAvoid using skin products and laundry detergents that contain fragrances or dyes.; Avoid wearing tight clothes and irritating fabrics.; Relax, reduce stress; Moisturize your skin with gentle moisturizers or ointments.; Prevent skin damage, if damaged, clean and bandage.; Take a shower with mild warm water for less than 5 minutes; Avoid taking long hot baths.; Use mild detergents and bath soaps with moisturizers; Avoid scrubbing your skin too hard as it can scratch the skin.; Limit eating shellfish: shrimp, crabs, snails, crabs...; Do not eat raw foods: blood pudding, meat salad, raw seafood...; People who are treating eczema abstain from eating foods that affect scars such as water spinach, sticky rice, corn, crab, shrimp...; Limit irritating foods that cause itching: eggs, poultry...; Do not use stimulants such as cigarettes, alcohol, beer, coffee...; Limit eating foods high in sugar: cakes, candy, tea...; Do not eat foods containing small toxins such as eggplant, sour bamboo shoots, etc.\nNummular eczema is influenced by the environment and constitution, so preventing the disease is very difficult. People with atopic or allergic conditions need to protect their skin more carefully. In case of symptoms of nummular eczema, you should see a dermatologist for early examination and treatment.",
