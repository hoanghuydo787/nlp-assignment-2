    "content": "Benign paroxysmal vertigo: Causes, diagnosis and treatment\n\nBenign paroxysmal vertigo is a disorder of the vestibular system that occurs when there is a sudden change in head position, such as when raising the head up or down, standing up or sitting up suddenly.\nBenign paroxysmal vertigo\n It can disappear on its own within a few days or weeks or progress into a chronic, recurring disease.\n Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo\n also called\nbenign paroxysmal positional vertigo\n or in short\nBenign paroxysmal vertigo\n (BPPV), also known as ectopic lithiasis. The disease makes you feel dizzy, your body spinning around other objects or objects spinning around you every time you suddenly change your head position. Although this is not a dangerous disease, dizziness can cause falls, especially in the elderly, leading to many complications such as broken arms, broken legs, head injuries, etc. Therefore, patients still need to be examined. and timely and effective treatment.\n\nWhat is benign paroxysmal vertigo?\nTo be able to understand exactly what benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is, you can start by analyzing each word in the name of this disease. Accordingly:\n“Dizziness” describes the feeling that everything is spinning, unable to maintain balance and unable to position in space.; “Postural” refers to the fact that dizziness only occurs when there is a sudden change in posture that causes the head position to change or move.; “Paroxysmal” is a word used to refer to this dizziness condition that only appears suddenly in a short time, when you change position, without warning signs.; “Benign” helps you understand that the disease is not life-threatening.\nSpecifically, benign paroxysmal vertigo is a disorder of the vestibular system. Benign paroxysmal vertigo develops when calcium carbonate particles (otoconia), also known as auditory canal stones, move and get stuck in the semicircular canal (the vestibular organ in the inner ear that plays a role in keeping the body balanced). ). When you change your head position, these stones enter one of the three semicircular canals, stimulating the vestibular system. When stimulated, the vestibular system sends signals to the brain and triggers dizziness.\nThis condition causes sudden dizziness when you change the position of your head, typically dizziness when lying down or dizziness when suddenly moving from standing to sitting, tilting your head to one side, etc.\nBenign paroxysmal vertigo is a disease with low risk. Dizziness attacks can range from mild to severe but have the common characteristic of only lasting a few minutes and not lasting too long. Some cases can go away on their own after a few weeks without treatment. If the disease recurs again, you should seek medical assistance for support, because although the disease rarely causes complications, dizziness can cause you to fall, leading to injury.\nBenign paroxysmal vertigo is quite common. Some statistics show that about 20% of the population suffers from this condition. (first)\nAbout 20% of the population has experienced benign paroxysmal vertigo\n\nSymptoms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo\nBenign paroxysmal vertigo often has symptoms similar to some other neurological diseases, so it is easy to be confused. Typically, common symptoms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo include: (2)\nFeeling dizzy, light-headed, everything around is spinning or moving;; Loss of balance, difficulty maintaining posture when standing or sitting;; Nausea, vomiting;; Visual impairment, blurred vision, nystagmus;; Feeling lightheaded.\nSymptoms of paroxysmal vertigo or ectropion usually only last approximately 1 minute without requiring medical intervention. In some cases, symptoms occur and end, then continue to recur. There are even special cases where the disease recurs after a few years since the patient last had symptoms of benign paroxysmal vertigo.\n\nCauses of benign paroxysmal vertigo\nIn most cases, doctors cannot find the exact cause of benign paroxysmal vertigo. In this case it is called idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.\nSome other causes of benign paroxysmal vertigo include: (3)\nThere is a strong impact to the head (common cause); Inner ear disorders; Damage during ear surgery; Migraine; …\nIn many cases, the cause of benign paroxysmal vertigo cannot be found\n\nWho is at risk for benign paroxysmal vertigo?\nAnyone can experience benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. However, the disease often appears in people over 50 years old. Young people are less likely to experience benign paroxysmal vertigo.\nBesides, gender is also a risk factor in people with benign paroxysmal vertigo. Accordingly, men will be more susceptible to the disease than women.\nAnd the final factor that increases the likelihood of benign paroxysmal vertigo is head trauma or disorders related to the vestibular system in the inner ear.\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo is considered a not too serious health problem. However, you should not be subjective because if the feeling of dizziness or lightheadedness when changing positions is accompanied by some other symptoms, you need to go to a medical facility for examination as soon as possible.\nAccordingly, you should see a doctor if you have the following accompanying symptoms:\nLoss of vision, double vision; Hearing loss; High fever; Severe headache that does not go away despite using painkillers; Lisping, difficulty speaking, unable to say a complete sentence; Weak limbs, unable to move limbs; Loss of consciousness; Falling, difficulty walking; Hands and feet are numb and tingling\nIn addition, you should see a doctor if dizziness lasts for many hours and does not go away.\nYou should go to the hospital if your dizziness is accompanied by severe headaches\n\nHow to diagnose\nIf you frequently experience dizziness when changing positions and see a doctor, your doctor may order some tests to determine whether you have benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and if If so, what is the cause? (4)\nFirst, the doctor will conduct an examination and ask the patient about some of the symptoms of the disease. During your physical exam, your doctor may ask you to move your head or eyes to check for signs and symptoms of vertigo.\nAdditionally, your doctor may also ask you to lie on your back, tilt your head to one side, and move your eyes. Then inform your doctor about the symptoms you experience, whether you feel dizzy or not.\nIn addition, the doctor will also look for signs of nystagmus and see if you are able to control eye movements.\nIn cases where the exact condition or cause of benign paroxysmal vertigo cannot be determined, the doctor may prescribe additional tests such as MRI, electronystagmography (ENG). ) or animated eye map (VNG)\nDoctors can rely on symptoms to determine the cause of benign paroxysmal vertigo\n\nHow to treat benign paroxysmal vertigo\nBenign paroxysmal vertigo is a \"special\" disease that can go away on its own in a short time without treatment. However, to limit the situation where the patient loses balance and falls or prevents the possibility of recurrence, the doctor can prescribe a number of treatment methods.\nOtolith repositioning\nThe otolith repositioning method can be performed at the hospital or the patient can also treat it themselves at home. With this method of treating benign paroxysmal vertigo, the patient needs to perform a number of positions to reposition the head, helping to move the stones from the semicircular canal into a small open area such as the vestibular sac. Each position will be performed and held for about 30 seconds.\nThis treatment technique can be repeated many times until the patient no longer experiences dizziness when changing positions.\nAlternative surgery\nIf the above treatment method is not effective, the patient may need surgery using a bone plug to block the part of the inner ear that causes your vertigo. The success rate after surgery is about 90%. However, it should be noted that after treatment, benign paroxysmal vertigo can still recur.\nPatients with symptoms of benign paroxysmal vertigo can visit the Department of Neurology, Neurology Center, Tam Anh General Hospital System. As one of the leading medical facilities in the field of examination and treatment of neurological diseases, Tam Anh Hospital gathers a team of experienced experts and leading doctors. Doctors at the Department of Neurology, Tam Anh General Hospital System all have solid professional knowledge, many years of clinical practice, are dedicated to patients and always try to support patients in the best way possible. can.\nNot only that, Tam Anh Hospital also has modern equipment and machinery, helping to accurately diagnose neurological diseases in general and benign paroxysmal vertigo in particular. Thanks to that, doctors can provide the most appropriate and optimal treatment regimen, helping to shorten treatment time and save maximum effort and treatment costs.\nTo schedule an examination and consultation on health issues at Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\n\nHow to prevent benign paroxysmal vertigo and advice for patients\nThere is no absolute prevention for benign paroxysmal vertigo. However, patients can apply a number of ways to prevent the disease from recurring or getting worse. If you are also suffering from the disease, you can apply some of the following tips:\nAvoid strong movements or sudden changes in position such as suddenly sitting or lying down.; Find a place to lie down or sit down as soon as you feel dizzy.; Limit movement or movement when dizzy to avoid falling leading to injury to other parts of the body.; If you wake up at night, turn on the light.; Use a walking stick when walking to increase stability and reduce the risk of falling.; Follow your doctor's instructions and treatment regimen.\nBenign paroxysmal vertigo is not a very dangerous disease and can even go away on its own after a while. If dizziness occurs frequently and is accompanied by other symptoms, please visit a reputable hospital to check your health!",
