Causes, symptoms and treatments\n\nDizziness, lightheadedness, lightheadedness, difficulty standing are symptoms of many related diseases such as vestibular disorders, anemia, stroke, hypoglycemia... Dizziness is not too dangerous, but if the condition persists, Long-term exposure will affect work, daily life and increase the risk of accidents when the body loses balance and falls. This article is expertly advised by Doctor Tran Thi Thuy Hang - Head of Ear, Nose and Throat Department - Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nOr what disease is dizziness?\nVertigo is a condition of loss of balance that makes you feel like you are spinning around, or that the world around you is spinning, putting you at risk of falling. Dizziness is not a disease but a symptom of many problems related to the body's health. People who often suffer from vertigo can suffer from diseases such as: stray stones in the ear, inner ear infection, vestibular neuritis, labyrinth fluid retention... Currently, there are statistics that vertigo accounts for 5-6%. doctor visits. Dizziness can occur at any age, but middle-aged and elderly people have the highest incidence. (first)\nDizziness can occur at any age, but the older you get, the more likely it is to occur.\n\nWhat does dizziness look like?\nVertigo creates the illusion that everything around you is rotating and moving. Dizziness often occurs when you suddenly change the position of your head. Then the patient will have the following symptoms:\nOverbalance; Spinning, tilting; Pulled in one direction; Dizziness, headache; Nausea, vomiting; Sweating, ringing in the ears; In addition, with dizziness, the patient will feel; Mental disorder, unable to think; Mental decline or instability; Blurred vision, dizziness\nIf you experience frequent dizziness, when should you see a doctor?\nIf you are someone who often experiences prolonged dizziness, or sudden dizziness but cannot explain the cause of the dizziness, you need to see a doctor for a timely examination. If you have dizziness with one of the following symptoms, you must immediately go to the hospital for a general examination to find the cause of the disease:\nSudden dizziness, severe headache; Loss of balance, unsteady steps or difficulty walking; Faint; Continuous vomiting; Speak slowly, say wrongly; Tinnitus, sudden hearing loss; Epileptic; Numbness of the face, numbness or paralysis of the arms or legs\n\nWhat causes dizziness?\nDizziness is a symptom of many different diseases. Common causes of vertigo include benign vertigo (BPPV), vestibular neuritis, Meniere's disease, and vestibular migraine. In addition, there are a series of causes that can lead to dizziness but not real dizziness such as: Stress, anxiety, dehydration, hypoglycemia, hypotension, side effects of medications, iron deficiency, allergies. response... Currently, vertigo is divided into 3 groups of causes: peripheral vertigo, central vertigo and combined causes. (2)\nCauses of peripheral vertigo\nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV): The disease occurs when small calcium particles move out of place in the semicircular canals of the inner ear, also known as ectopic stones in the ear. Although benign paroxysmal positional vertigo can cause discomfort, it is rarely serious, except for injuries caused by falls. Common symptoms of benign positional vertigo are: dizziness, loss of balance, nausea or vomiting.; Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV): The disease occurs when small calcium particles move out of place in the semicircular canals of the inner ear, also known as ectopic stones in the ear. Although benign paroxysmal positional vertigo can cause discomfort, it is rarely serious, except for injuries caused by falls. Common symptoms of benign positional vertigo are: dizziness, loss of balance, nausea or vomiting.\nMeniere's disease: is a disorder that occurs in the inner ear due to fluid retention and pressure changes in the vestibular system of the ear, causing vertigo accompanied by tinnitus and hearing loss.; Meniere's disease: is a disorder that occurs in the inner ear due to fluid retention and pressure changes in the vestibular system of the ear, causing vertigo accompanied by tinnitus and hearing loss.\nVestibular neuritis: neuritis in the inner ear causes damage to the vestibular nerve after a viral infection. This disease can cause severe, continuous dizziness, sometimes requiring the patient to be hospitalized.; Vestibular neuritis: neuritis in the inner ear causes damage to the vestibular nerve after a viral infection. This disease can cause severe, continuous dizziness, sometimes requiring the patient to be hospitalized.\nNeuroma VIII: The initial symptoms of vestibulocochlear neuroma are often hearing loss and this process is slow. In addition, other common symptoms that may occur are feelings of dizziness, loss of balance, tinnitus.; Neuroma VIII: The initial symptoms of vestibulocochlear neuroma are often hearing loss and this process is slow. In addition, other common symptoms that may occur are feelings of dizziness, loss of balance, and tinnitus.\nCauses of central vertigo\nVestibular migraine: This disease is also known by a few other names such as: \"migraine\" with symptoms of dizziness. Headaches can occur suddenly or have warning symptoms such as: dizziness, blurred vision, vertigo, tinnitus, double vision, and scalp numbness. According to surveys, the prevalence of migraine in the world is about 15% in women and 5% in men. About 12% of the population has this disease.; Vestibular migraine: This disease is also known by a few other names such as: \"migraine\" with symptoms of dizziness.

Causes, prevention and treatment.; Stomach pain, nausea, dizziness, what disease is it? Causes and prevention.\n\nWho is dizziness common in?\nThe phenomenon of dizziness has many causes, so the group of people with dizziness is not narrow but very common. Children, young people, and the elderly can all suffer from vertigo.\n1. Elderly and middle-aged people\nAccording to a study published in the US, about 35% of people with vestibular disorders are over the age of 40, which is one of the leading causes of dizziness. Middle-aged and elderly people experience dizziness due to vestibular disorders and cerebral anemia. Particularly for the elderly, dizziness often occurs at midnight or early morning. They wake up and cannot sit up due to dizziness, vertigo, nausea, the body is dizzy, dizzy, loses balance, and can fall to the ground.\n2. Young people do mental work\nYoung people in the office world are also subjects who often suffer from vertigo. These people often work in air-conditioned environments with cold and dry air, so it is easy for the cervical spine to get cold and poor blood circulation to the brain. In addition, because they have the habit of sitting in one place working for too long and work pressure leads to stress on the brain, cerebral anemia will become more and more severe, causing dizziness and lightheadedness.\nPregnant and premenopausal women are susceptible to dizziness\n3. Pregnant women, premenopausal women\nDuring pregnancy or premenopause, women's physiology changes a lot. They are often irritable, worried, negative, suspicious, and angry for no reason. The reason why psychology becomes so erratic is because the amount of female hormones in the body changes suddenly, triggering dizziness.\nPeople who have had a head injury: People who have had a head injury may have vestibular dysfunction leading to dizziness, memory loss, and reduced ability to work.\nSee more: Dizziness: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis and prevention.\n\nHow to diagnose the cause of dizziness?\nDizziness has many causes, including stroke, brain tumor, and brain injury. The doctor will perform a clinical examination to determine the condition of dizziness, then may prescribe additional diagnostic imaging methods and tests to check the cause. Below are some diagnostic indications that are often applied when patients have signs of persistent dizziness.\nPatients will be examined by a combined Ear, Nose and Throat doctor and Neurologist to know the exact symptoms and medical history such as:\nCheck your balance and gait: This involves watching you walk, to see if you walk straight or lean to one side, as well as checking balance when standing still.; Check your balance and gait: This involves watching you walk, to see if you walk straight or lean to one side, as well as checking balance when standing still.\nVestibulo-ocular reflex: When you look at moving objects and when your head moves. You may be asked to follow an object with your eyes or focus on one thing while moving from one side to the other.; Vestibulo-ocular reflex: When you look at moving objects and when your head moves. You may be asked to follow an object with your eyes or to focus on one thing while moving from one side to the other.\nEar, nose and throat endoscopy and measuring hearing function: the doctor will conduct an endoscopy of the ear and nasopharynx related to the ear, the technician will check the hearing to know which ENT diseases affect the organ. vestibule.; Ear, nose and throat endoscopy and measuring hearing function: the doctor will conduct an endoscopy of the ear and nasopharynx related to the ear, the technician will check the hearing to know which ENT diseases affect the organ. vestibule.\nEar endoscopy to check and measure hearing function at Tam Anh General Hospital\nComprehensive neurological examination using imaging: The doctor will use additional diagnostic imaging equipment to rule out life-threatening medical causes, especially stroke. Tam Anh General Hospital is the first hospital equipped with a state-of-the-art vestibular measuring system from the US - Natus to accurately diagnose and effectively treat most causes of dizziness.; Comprehensive neurological examination using imaging: The doctor will use additional diagnostic imaging equipment to rule out life-threatening medical causes, especially stroke. Tam Anh General Hospital is the first hospital equipped with a state-of-the-art vestibular measuring system from the US - Natus to accurately diagnose and effectively treat most causes of dizziness.\nCT scan, MRI brain scan: when the doctor suspects that the patient is dizzy due to stroke, brain tumor, or brain injury, the doctor will prescribe the patient to use paraclinical methods using imaging equipment. CT scan, MRI scan.; CT scan, MRI brain scan: when the doctor suspects that the patient is dizzy due to stroke, brain tumor, or brain injury, the doctor will prescribe the patient to use paraclinical methods using imaging equipment. CT scan, MRI scan.\n\nHow to treat dizziness\nProlonged dizziness can affect your health and reduce your ability to work. There are only some symptoms of dizziness that can go away on their own as the body adapts and do not require treatment. If the dizziness is long-term, accompanied by signs such as vomiting, difficulty breathing, fever, or numbness in the limbs, the person with dizziness needs to go to a medical facility for examination and treatment. To treat a patient's vertigo, doctors base on determining the cause to have a reasonable treatment plan. Most dizziness symptoms are treated with medication or balance exercises, surgery... (3)\nVestibular rehabilitation combined with the ICS Impulse system: Your doctor will prescribe physical therapy exercises to train your senses to compensate for vertigo. This remedy is recommended if you experience recurring dizziness. From there, vestibular rehabilitation works by helping the brain adjust its response to changes in the vestibular system. This therapy helps train your eyes and senses so you can learn how to adapt and be most useful when your body begins to have symptoms of dizziness. Currently, Tam Anh General Hospital applies vestibular rehabilitation exercise therapy combining the ICS Impulse system for the first time in Vietnam with BPPV treatment methods for a success rate of 80-90%.\nAmerican Natus vestibular monitor at Tam Anh General Hospital\nOtolith repositioning procedure: The American Academy of Neurology has produced a series of detailed head and body movement guidelines for patients with BPPV. The movements are performed to move calcium stones from the ear canal into the inner ear cavity to be absorbed by the body. Patients will be instructed to perform the safest and most effective movements such as the Epley test, Semont, and BBQ Roll. These exercises can cause more dizziness if you do them yourself or do them incorrectly, so you need to practice under the guidance of a doctor at the hospital and then practice at home.; Otolith repositioning procedure: The American Academy of Neurology has produced a series of detailed head and body movement guidelines for patients with BPPV.

If dizziness is caused by infection or inflammation, antibiotics to treat the infection or anti-inflammatory drugs can help reduce swelling. Anti-anxiety medications such as: Diazepam, Alprazolam Anti-nausea and allergy medications Diuretics: Your doctor may prescribe diuretics if you have headaches due to Meniere's disease.

If vertigo is caused by a more serious underlying problem, such as a tumor or injury to the brain or neck, your doctor will focus on treating the root cause to control the vertigo. There are 3 surgical options including: Endolymphatic sac decompression surgery, 8th vestibular nerve resection surgery, and labyrinthectomy surgery. Endolymphatic sac decompression surgery: This surgery can help relieve vertigo by reducing fluid production or increasing fluid absorption in the inner ear. When decompressing the endolymphatic sac, a portion of bone is removed from the sac. Vestibular nerve resection surgery: The patient will have the nerve that connects the sense of balance and movement of the inner ear with the brain while still retaining hearing function. Labyrinthectomy: The patient will have the balance portion of the inner ear removed, eliminating both balance and hearing functions.

Middle-aged and elderly people experience dizziness due to vestibular disorders and cerebral anemia. Particularly for the elderly, dizziness often occurs at midnight or early morning. They wake up and cannot sit up due to dizziness, vertigo, nausea, the body is dizzy, dizzy, loses balance, and can fall to the ground.\n2. Young people do mental work\nYoung people in the office world are also subjects who often suffer from vertigo. These people often work in air-conditioned environments with cold and dry air, so it is easy for the cervical spine to get cold and poor blood circulation to the brain. In addition, because they have the habit of sitting in one place working for too long and work pressure leads to stress on the brain, cerebral anemia will become more and more severe, causing dizziness and lightheadedness.\nPregnant and premenopausal women are susceptible to dizziness\n3. Pregnant women, premenopausal women\nDuring pregnancy or premenopause, women's physiology changes a lot. They are often irritable, worried, negative, suspicious, and angry for no reason. The reason why psychology becomes so erratic is because the amount of female hormones in the body changes suddenly, triggering dizziness.\nPeople who have had a head injury: People who have had a head injury may have vestibular dysfunction leading to dizziness, memory loss, and reduced ability to work.\nSee more: Dizziness: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis and prevention.",
