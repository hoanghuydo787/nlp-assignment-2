    "content": "Delayed labor: Causes, signs of recognition and treatment\n\nArrested labor is one of the leading indications for cesarean section in the world. Accurate diagnosis of this condition will help doctors handle it promptly, helping the mother and fetus pass labor safely.\n\nWhat is stalled labor?\nStagnation of labor or arrested labor is the prolongation of the mother's labor beyond the time the fetus is scheduled to be born, accompanied by many complications for the pregnant woman and the baby. Arrested labor includes prolonged labor and obstructed labor. This is a labor that has stopped due to mechanical causes or requires immediate intervention.\nPROLONGED LABOR OBSTRUCTIONED LABOR PHASE I Latent phase Numbness Lasts > 20 hours Weakness Lasts > 14 hours Active phase Numbness Cervical dilation rate <1cm/hour Cervix does not dilate further during ≥ 2 hours for males and females Cervical dilation speed <1.2 – 1.5cm/hour Cervix does not dilate further for ≥ 2 hours for males and females if obstetric pain relief is available PERIOD II First and last with obstetric analgesia: >3 hours Without obstetric analgesia: >2 hours or rate of fetal presentation <1cm/hour\n\nSigns of labor stopping progress\nSigns of stalled labor include:(1)\nThrough observation, the process of uterine contractions takes place continuously but the fetal penetration does not progress or there are no further changes.; There are phenomena such as serous hump, overlapping skull joints.; There is no evidence of continued dilation of the cervix.; Labor lasts more than 14-20 hours.; Pregnant women are exhausted, may become dehydrated, and their mouth may become dry due to prolonged mouth breathing.; Pain in the back and sides of the body, spreading to the thighs due to strong pressure on the back for a long time.; Reduces labor pain over time as muscles become fatigued.; High heart rate due to dehydration, exhaustion and stress.; The uterus is tender to the touch and does not relax completely between contractions.; Fetal failure\nHowever, not all cases of stopped labor have all of the above signs. The doctor will be the one to directly examine and decide on treatment in each specific case.\n\nCauses of delayed labor\nArrested labor is a difficult birth that is not detected early. However, based on the manifestations, it can be divided into 2 main causes: (2)\nDue to the pregnant mother's constitution\nThe mother's body may have some defects in the pelvis such as an overall narrow, flat, transversely narrow, and distorted skeleton. Pregnant mothers with ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids in the anterior position, pelvic tumors, and double uterus are also factors that affect the journey of labor.\nDue to abnormal fetal position\nThe stage of labor can be affected by fetal position. Abnormal crowns have large crown diameters: horizontal, forehead, face. The head position is not good if the head is bowed, the position is bad like posterior occiput or transverse occiput. The umbilical cord is short, the fetus is large (over 3500 grams).\n\nDiagnosis of delayed labor\nBased on the labor chart:\nThe cervical opening line is to the right of the alarm line (early) or crosses the action line (late).; Uterine contractions with a frequency of 3/10 minutes but after 4 hours there is no progress in penetration.\nClinically based:\nThe head has overlapping bones and serous humps; Often accompanied by fetal distress; The mother shows signs of dehydration and acidosis (urine contains acetone). The amount of urine monitored in 4 hours is less than 100ml.; Depending on how early or late labor appears, the uterus will be stretched, the spasm will appear, the bladder will be stretched, and the colon will be bulging.\n\nComplications may occur\nWhen labor is slow or stops progressing, risks arise for both mother and baby. Doctors are required to treat this condition quickly to prevent possible serious complications. Possible risks related to not handling this condition well include:\nFor the fetus\nIncreased rates of fetal distress, fetal asphyxia, and fetal death due to lack of oxygen;; Sequelae due to traumatic brain injury;; Increase the rate of using forceps or vacuum aspiration for cesarean section;; Sepsis;; Some complications affect the baby for life such as cerebral palsy, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and seizure disorders.\nFor mom\nUterine rupture;; Haemorrhage;; Mother's injuries during childbirth (cervical tear, vaginal wall tear);; Postpartum infection.\n\nManagement of labor that stops progressing\nWhile waiting for the baby to be born, the mother can calculate the exact number of hours that labor lasts, and slowly feel the uterine contractions and fetal heartbeat of the baby in the womb. . This is very good for mothers to keep their mind calm and be able to monitor for themselves whether the condition of the fetus in the womb is okay or not.\nIn addition, pregnant mothers should have regular prenatal checkups at hospitals with obstetrics departments to be carefully monitored, especially not to miss important prenatal checkup milestones near the end of pregnancy after week 36. When considering the pregnant woman's condition, the doctor will make reasonable instructions. If a pregnant woman has false labor contractions, the doctor will advise on fetal monitoring, appropriate diet and rest.\nIn cases where it is determined that labor is stalled, doctors can apply some of the following methods to manage:\nIf the pregnant mother shows signs of a difficult birth, the commune level will be referred to a higher level.; At the district level and above: the treatment of stopped labor will be based on the causes: Pregnant women will give birth vaginally with birthing aids such as forceps or traction when qualified. (3) Using medication to correct weak contractions during prolonged labor. Caesarean section for pregnant women with indications. Abortion in indicated cases.; Pregnant women will give birth vaginally with birthing aids such as forceps or traction when qualified.(3); Use medication to regulate weak contractions during prolonged labor.; Caesarean section for pregnant women with indications; Abortion in cases of indication.\n\nPrecautions\nTo reduce the risk of delayed labor affecting the health of yourself and your baby, pregnant mothers should note: (4)\nPerform regular prenatal checkups as recommended by your doctor.
