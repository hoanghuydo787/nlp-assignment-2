    "content": "Prolonged labor: Causes, signs, treatment and prevention\n\nProlonged labor is described when the method of birth is cesarean section or vaginal birth but there is a physician's influence when labor lasts more than 12 hours or there are adverse risks that will occur. with pregnant women and fetuses. Long-term labor can lead to serious complications or sequelae if not detected early and treated promptly.\n\nWhat does normal labor look like?\nLabor is a physiological process in which the fruits of conception including the fetus, amniotic membrane, umbilical cord and placenta are expelled out of the uterus. The process of labor is achieved through changes with the gradual opening and dilation of the cervix under the influence of rhythmic uterine contractions of sufficient frequency, intensity and duration.\nFor women giving birth to their first child, the average labor time is 12 - 18 hours. In pregnant women giving birth, the labor time is shorter, on average from 8 to 12 hours. Prolonged labor is when labor lasts longer than 24 hours.\nCharacteristics of true labor contractions to distinguish them from false contractions - Braxton Hicks are as follows:\nRegular, painful contractions;; Contractions have gradually shorter intervals;; Contractions increase in intensity and duration;; There is a relationship between the intensity of contractions and pain;; The contraction causes the cervix to open;; Fetal position down;\nWomen are diagnosed with labor when they have the following signs:\nIntermittent abdominal pain;; Pink vaginal discharge;; Labor contractions;; Removal of cervical opening;; Establishment of the amnion.\nLabor is a normal physiological process in pregnant women to prepare for the \"labor\" process.\nNormal labor is divided into 3 stages:\nStage 1: Open the cervix\nIn the latent stage, the cervix opens 3-4 centimeters and dilates, contractions become more frequent (usually 5 to 20 minutes apart).\nUterine contractions appear naturally without the mother's will. Uterine contractions cause pain. Depending on the pain threshold of each pregnant woman, some people will feel less or more pain. When the contraction pressure reaches 25-30 mmHg, the pregnant woman begins to feel pain. At this stage, pain often appears late, after uterine contractions and disappears before uterine contractions end.\nThe doctor will determine cervical dilation through a vaginal examination (internal examination). This is the longest and least intense stage of labor. Pregnant women are often hospitalized during this period. Some pregnant women may not realize they are in labor if their contractions are light and irregular.\nNext comes the active phase, signaled by dilation of the cervix from 4 to 7 cm. Contractions become longer, more painful, and more frequent (usually 2 to 4 minutes apart).\nThe transition occurs when the cervix dilates from 8 to 10 cm. Contractions are often cyclical and regular, gradually getting faster and longer, lasting only 15 to 20 seconds at the beginning of labor, then reaching 30 to 40 seconds at the end of the cervical dilation phase. The intensity of uterine contractions also gradually increases. Contractions pressure at the beginning of labor ranges from 30-35 mmHg, gradually increasing to 60-90 mmHg.\nStage 2: Delivery of the fetus\nThe second stage of labor begins when the cervix is ​​fully dilated and ends with the birth of the baby. In the second stage, the pregnant mother tries to push the baby out through the vagina. The second stage is shorter than the first stage and can take from 30 minutes to 2 hours (average is 50 minutes) if the mother is giving birth to a nulliparous child (first time). This time will be shortened to 15 minutes to 1 hour (average 20 minutes) if the mother gives birth to a baby.\nStage 3: Vegetable book\nAfter giving birth to the baby, the woman enters the third and final stage of labor: delivery of the placenta. This stage usually lasts only a few minutes to 30 minutes  and involves the passage of the placenta out of the uterus and through the vagina.\nEvery labor experience is different and the amount of time spent in each stage will vary. However, labor for the first birth usually lasts about 12 to 14 hours, shorter for subsequent births.\n\nWhat is stretch transfer?\nProlonged labor is labor that lasts longer than normal labor, lasting about 18 to 24 hours. Mothers giving birth to their first child are often expected to labor longer than mothers giving birth to multiples, so prolonged labor can be counted as 18-24 hours for mothers with a first child and 16-18 hours for mothers with a first child. The woman gives birth for the second or third time. In twin pregnancies, a labor that lasts more than 16 hours is considered prolonged. (first)\nThis condition can lead to many dangers for the mother and baby if not detected and treated promptly.\n\nSigns of prolonged labor\nSome symptoms that may be signs of prolonged labor are:\nLabor lasting more than 18 hours: This may be the most prominent sign of prolonged labor; Exhausted pregnant women: Fatigue and exhaustion can cause dehydration and the mouth can become dry due to prolonged mouth breathing; Pain in the back and sides of the body, spreading to the thighs due to strong pressure on the back for a long time.; Reduces labor pain over time as muscles become fatigued; Rapid heartbeat due to dehydration, exhaustion and stress; The uterus is tender to the touch and does not relax completely between contractions;\n\nCauses of prolonged labor\nThere are many potential reasons why your labor may not be going smoothly (2). Some key factors include:\nCharacteristics of contractions\nUterine contractions are considered the main driving force of labor. Any disorder of uterine contractions causes difficulty and can even cause labor to stall or prolong.; Uterine contractions are reduced, contractions are rare and the intensity of contractions is weak or uterine muscle tone is insufficient.\nFetus\nFetal size is larger than average, fetal assessment depends on fetal weight, fetuses over 3,500 grams are called macrosomia - with a normal pelvis of Vietnamese women, fetuses over 3,500 grams can be will cause the mother to have difficulty giving birth;; Large fetal head circumference;; Abnormal fetal position; The fetus has congenital deformities such as hydrocephalus, toad belly... which can cause the fetus to grow larger, causing difficulty during labor...\nFrom mother\nPsychology of pregnant women;; Narrow pelvis;; The vagina is not dilated enough for the baby to be born;; Genital tract and pelvic tumors obstruct the birth canal;; Congenital abnormal uterus: double uterus, underdeveloped uterus;; Pregnant women with high total weight or body mass index...\nAbout 55% of prolonged labor is due to contractions, 30% is due to the fetus, and 15% is due to pelvic abnormalities. In a few cases, contractions are good, the fetus is well positioned, and there is no asymmetry, but the mother shows signs of excessive anxiety. This psychological factor affects the progress of cervical opening.\n\nWhat to do when labor is slow\nA pregnant woman who has been in labor for more than 18 hours or has been to the obstetrics facility for more than 12 hours without giving birth should be considered immediately. The doctor will consider based on signs such as:\nDoes the mother experience dehydration or acidosis?; Is there an infection (fever)?; Is there anemia?; Is there psychological trauma?; Having problems with contractions?; Is there a problem with the fetus?; Is there a problem from the pregnant woman, such as a comorbidity?; Check to see if your water has broken?; What is the degree of effacement and density of the cervix?; Constipated or a full bladder?\nAfter determining the cause of prolonged labor, depending on each case, the doctor will choose the appropriate treatment method. (3)\n1. Use Oxytocin\nIf a woman has a prolonged period of active labor, doctors sometimes give Oxytocin. This is a synthetic hormone used to induce labor, strengthen and regulate uterine contractions. If used properly, Oxytocin can speed up the labor process, and is relatively effective in treating cases of prolonged labor. Depending on the clinical situation of each pregnant woman, the doctor will carefully review it before prescribing Oxytocin.\n2. Amniotic rupture or amniotic rupture\nAmniocentesis or amniotomy  is a procedure in which a doctor breaks a woman's membranes with a finger or a special instrument to speed up labor. When combined with Oxytocin,  amniocentesis or amniocentesis can help induce or enhance labor.\n3. Assisted birth using suction cups or forceps\nThese are tools used to support vaginal birth during the delivery period when the mother pushes weakly or the mother has an accompanying medical condition. If used properly, these tools can help shorten the delivery period. If used incorrectly and incorrectly, it can cause trauma to the mother's genital tract and trauma to the baby. To limit complications for mother and baby, suction cups and forceps are only used when prescribed to shorten the labor process.\n4. Caesarean section\nIf labor is prolonged by unsuccessful oxytocin-corrected uterine contractions, a cesarean section should be performed.\n\nRisks mother and baby may encounter\nProlonged labor can cause complications for the mother: postpartum hemorrhage, uterine rupture, amniotic infection, postpartum infection; Sepsis is the next consequence of amniotic infection;…\nThis phenomenon can cause fetal distress during labor, neonatal infection due to the fetus drinking and breathing bad amniotic fluid..\nFor newborns, perinatal mortality is proportional to the length of labor. Perinatal mortality can be twice as high if labor lasts more than 24 hours. The cause of death was pneumonia (following infection from the uterine cavity), asphyxiation, and postpartum trauma.\nThe most common cause of brain damage leading to cerebral palsy is lack of oxygen supply to the fetus or newborn, also known as birth asphyxia. The longer the baby is deprived of oxygen, the more severe the damage can be. Causes of birth asphyxia are related to prolonged labor: hemorrhage, difficult birth due to large fetus, amniotic infection...\nDoctors will rely on the Apgar index to quickly assess the child's health status after birth. This index is assessed at one minute and five minutes immediately after birth to determine the baby's health status including checking heart rate, muscle tone, reflexes, breathing rate and skin color.\nProlonged labor is a problem that pregnant mothers may  encounter when giving birth. However, with intensive care monitoring and treatment from doctors and midwives, possible complications can be limited.\n\nHow to prevent\nTo reduce the risk of prolonged labor affecting the health of mother and baby, pregnant mothers can take some preventive measures such as:\nMaintain a healthy lifestyle, eat a nutritious diet, and do light exercise as recommended by doctors and medical staff.; Avoid stress, anxiety, keeping a relaxed and happy spirit and avoiding negative factors will help pregnant mothers have a healthy pregnancy.; Go for regular prenatal checkups: Remembering important prenatal checkup milestones and performing regular checkups is extremely necessary. The examination helps the doctor early detect pregnancy risks as well as give advice on the pregnant mother's condition such as whether she is gaining too much weight leading to obesity or the fetus is disproportionately large to the mother's pelvis... This helps doctors come up with timely intervention plans.\nTam Anh General Hospital always accompanies pregnant mothers, so that their \"labor\" journey is peaceful and complete.\nChoosing a pregnancy and birth care unit is extremely important. Tam Anh General Hospital is one of the reliable obstetrical care addresses that pregnant mothers can choose with peace of mind.
