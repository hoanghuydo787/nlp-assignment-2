    "content": "Is false labor dangerous? Causes, signs, prevention\n\nAlmost every pregnant woman goes through it\nfalse labor contractions (also called Braxton Hicks contractions). Pregnant mothers should learn to distinguish the difference between real labor -\nfake\n to know when to go to the hospital and when not to.\n\nWhat is false labor?\nFalse labor is labor that has symptoms that are quite similar to real labor, but they are not the usual signs of impending birth. Pregnant women can experience these types of contractions at any time during pregnancy. Sometimes, this is considered a \"stepping stone\" that shows that real labor is about to happen. Sometimes, you feel contractions in the lower abdomen at the end of the second trimester, or even earlier, but do not cause cervical dilation, and that is definitely false labor.\nFalse labor has symptoms quite similar to real labor\nMany pregnant mothers confuse these two labors. If you have never experienced childbirth, pay attention to the typical signs of this phenomenon so you don't worry too much. (first)\n\nSigns of Braxton Hicks false labor contractions\nFalse labor contractions make pregnant women feel like they are tightening in the lower abdomen. There are mild, transient contractions, but stronger contractions can cause pain and difficulty breathing. Some pregnant women still have a feeling similar to menstrual cramps.\nBraxton Hicks contractions are often accompanied by signs such as vaginal discharge (can be brown, not pink or mixed with blood), fluid flowing from the private area (due to urinary incontinence, urine leakage...), and rashes. cramps, back pain…\nUnlike true labor contractions, false labor does not repeat periodically. They come and go, can get weaker or stronger, not in any cycle, usually occurring when entering the second or third trimester.\nInitially, false labor \"visited\" infrequently, only occurring a few times a day. As you enter your third trimester and get closer to your due date, false contractions may occur multiple times per hour, for many hours at a time. They will appear more often if you are dehydrated or overexerted (2)\nContractions can help thin and soften the cervix, contributing to a smooth labor later without having to use labor induction methods.\nBraxton Hicks contractions cause a feeling of tightness in the lower abdomen\n\nHow is fake labor different from real labor?\nTo know whether the contractions you are experiencing are real labor or not, Dr. Le Thi Kim Ngan advises you to pay attention to the following differences:\nFalse labor Real labor Time when it starts Usually occurs from the 2nd trimester onwards, 37 weeks of pregnancy onwards. True labor that occurs at an earlier time is called preterm labor. Characteristic signs Contractions appear at times strong and weak.  Strong, painful contractions, accompanied by cramps with increasing intensity . Location of contractions The front of the abdomen. Starting from the back, wrap around the belly. The duration is 30 seconds - 2 minutes 30 - 70 seconds, getting longer and longer. Frequency Not regular, not recurring periodically. Repeat with increasing frequency, the distance between contractions becoming closer and closer together. Time of termination It may disappear when the pregnant woman rests, changes position, drinks water...  Does not end but the contractions become more and more intense.\nHow to distinguish between real and fake labor\n\nCauses of labor contractions\nThe exact cause of false labor contractions is unknown. However, researchers believe that some activities of pregnant women can cause stress to the baby in the womb. Contractions occur to help increase blood flow to the placenta, while providing the baby with more oxygen.\nSpecific causes of Braxton Hicks contractions include:\nDehydration: Pregnant women need 2 – 3 liters of water every day. Not drinking enough water can cause false labor to appear more frequently.; Overexertion: False labor is at risk of appearing at the end of the day if you have to stand for too long during the day or exercise too hard.; Sexual activity: When you orgasm, your body produces a hormone called oxytocin. This hormone causes muscles, such as the uterus, to contract. In addition, semen containing prostaglandin is also capable of causing uterine contractions; Full bladder: A full bladder will put pressure on the uterus, causing uterine contractions or cramps.\n\nHow long does it take for false labor to give birth?\nIt is not possible to determine exactly how long after false labor the baby is born. Because Braxton Hicks contractions are not a sign of childbirth. As mentioned above, this condition can appear at any stage of pregnancy, from the 6th and 7th weeks of pregnancy to the 8th and 9th months. What you need to do is not to confuse the signs of transition. real labor – fake labor to have appropriate responses. (3)\n\nIs false labor dangerous? When to see a doctor?\nThe phenomenon of false labor is completely NORMAL and not dangerous. Therefore, you do not need to see a doctor if you experience false labor contractions. However, many pregnant women cannot distinguish the different symptoms between the two labors. Maybe they're in real labor but think it's fake, and vice versa. Therefore, if you see contractions accompanied by the following signs, you need to go to the hospital immediately:\nVaginal bleeding; Rupture of amniotic membranes; The fetus does not move or moves less than 8 times in 2 hours; Pain spreading to the lower back and abdomen, increasing day by day; The contractions become increasingly stronger and longer lasting; Changing positions does not help relieve contractions; Shortness of breath or chest pain; You're approaching your due date and contractions are coming closer and closer together.\n\nHow to handle false labor contractions\nOnce your doctor has confirmed that what you are experiencing is just a sign of false labor, you can relax and do not need any medical treatment. Try to rest, drink more water and change positions. Specifically:\nUrinating to empty the bladder; Drink 3-4 glasses of filtered water or milk, fruit juice, herbal tea...; Change lying/sitting position, such as moving from bed to couch, from sofa to recliner...; Lie on your left side to promote better blood flow to the uterus, kidneys and placenta.; Soak in a warm bath. This helps the pelvic muscles relax, thereby reducing contractions; Take advantage of rest and lie on your left side to control false labor contractions\nIf you've tried everything and your condition doesn't improve, your doctor may prescribe medication to help relieve your uterine contractions.\n\nHow to prevent false labor\nThere is no way to absolutely prevent false labor. Because every pregnant woman experiences false labor contractions at least a few times. If you control it well, you will reduce the frequency of Braxton Hicks contractions. To do this, you should:\nDrink enough water: minimum 2 - 2.5 liters/day;; Avoid excessive exercise: Do not do high-intensity exercises. Instead, choose subjects that are beneficial for pregnant mothers' health such as yoga, swimming, gentle walking... In addition, you should avoid standing for too long during the day;; Do not hold urine: to reduce pressure on the bladder;; Limit sexual activity during the last months of pregnancy;; Prenatal check-ups on schedule allow the doctor to closely monitor the health status of mother and baby as well as detect early signs of abnormalities during pregnancy.\nPregnant mothers are carefully examined throughout their pregnancy when they come to the Obstetrics and Gynecology center, Tam Anh General Hospital\nNot only equipped with the most modern machinery system, gathering a team of dedicated doctors, Obstetrics and Gynecology Center, Tam Anh General Hospital also combines many specialties such as: Pediatrics, Neonatology, Diagnosis Imaging, Laboratory Testing, Cardiology, Anesthesia and Resuscitation... effectively support doctors in accurately monitoring and assessing the health status of pregnancy, especially in high-risk pregnancies before, during and after birth.\nIn particular, the Obstetrics and Gynecology Center, Tam Anh General Hospital is also a pioneer in collaborating with other specialties to apply painless birth methods; Anesthesia time is shortened to minimize side effects of the drug; Screening 73 diseases of newborns; Early Kangaroo (skin-to-skin) for premature infants; storing stem cells from blood and umbilical cord tissue; Consulting on cosmetic services and rehabilitation of the private area and pelvic floor after vaginal birth, cesarean section...\nTo register for examination, consultation and maternity care at Tam Anh General Hospital, mothers can contact:\nFalse labor is the mother's body's way of preparing for the day of welcoming her baby. In other words, this is a stepping stone to help you get used to real labor contractions, preparing for a safe labor. You need to master the familiar signs of false labor to have appropriate treatment and avoid confusion and anxiety.",
