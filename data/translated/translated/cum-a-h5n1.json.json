    "content": "Influenza A H5N1: Symptoms, causes, treatment and prevention\n\nThe H5N1 virus can cause severe H5N1 influenza A with high mortality. With its ability to evolve quickly, H5N1 can easily cause large flu epidemics if not strictly controlled.\n This article is expertly advised by Dr. Tran Vu Minh Phat, Medical Information Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nWhat is H5N1?\nH5N1 is an influenza A virus capable of causing dangerous infectious diseases in poultry, that's why H5N1 is also called avian flu. Influenza A H5N1 can be transmitted from poultry to humans. When infected, the mortality rate can be up to 60%. (first)\nH5N1 has notable characteristics such as:\nHighly mutagenic, highly pathogenic - can cause severe disease in humans; Contains genes from many viruses that infect many other animals; Because it follows resident bird flocks, it has a high rate of spread; Capable of direct infection from poultry (birds, chickens) to humans; Survival ability: Live for at least 35 days at a temperature of 4 degrees Celsius, at 37 degrees Celsius can live up to 6 days in poultry feces, live for many years in a freezing environment.\nThe H5N1 virus has rapid mutation and high pathogenicity\n\nSymptoms of influenza A H5N1 in humans\nWhen infected with influenza A H5N1, the most common symptoms include high fever over 38 degrees, cough, sore throat, muscle pain... In some people, initial symptoms such as abdominal pain, chest pain, etc. may appear. vomiting or diarrhea.\nViral infections have a high risk of rapidly progressing to dangerous respiratory diseases (such as Acute Respiratory Syndrome - difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, pneumonia) or having neurological effects (convulsions). , appearance of abnormal mental states,...). (2)\n\nHow is influenza A H5N1 transmitted?\nThe H5N1 virus can infect and cause illness in humans when we come into contact with infected poultry without protective measures. Person-to-person transmission is very rare. According to the US Food and Agriculture Organization, there are a number of things that can make us sick, such as:\nContact and touch sick poultry; Touching or inhaling diseased poultry secretions; Contact (slaughtering, processing with infected meat sources; Eating undercooked poultry or eggs\nProcessing virus-infected poultry is one of the routes of H5N1 transmission\n\nIs influenza A H5N1 dangerous?\nWith a mortality rate of up to 60%, influenza A H5N1 is a health hazard that we must not let down our guard against. Influenza can progress rapidly, leading to many serious complications that adversely affect the conjunctiva, damage the respiratory system (broncho-pulmonary superinfection, pneumonia, ear, nose and throat superinfection), nervous system (cerebral edema). , lymphocytic meningitis); causes multi-organ failure, immune system deficiency and other health conditions such as pericarditis, myocarditis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, etc.\n\nStages of development of influenza A H5N1\nInfluenza A H5N1 has 3 stages of development:\nFirst is the incubation period, with no signs. Influenza virus can hide in the body for 2-8 days, but can also last up to 17 days after the patient is exposed to pathogenic factors.; Next is the disease onset stage. At this time, infected people gradually appear symptoms such as high fever, dry cough, body aches, loss of appetite,...; Finally, the disease enters its full-blown stage. Symptoms of influenza A H5N1 gradually become clearer and more severe. The patient may fall into a coma, lose consciousness, have headaches, eye socket pain or severe lumbar pain. If you do not receive proper medical care early, the condition will become more difficult to control.\n\nHow to diagnose influenza A H5N1\nTesting is a method of diagnosing H5N1 virus infection. Types of specimens taken for testing include venous blood, nose/throat fluid, bronchial aspirate, lung biopsy samples, bronchus or post-mortem lung tissue.\nCurrent popular methods include: (3)\nRT-PCR technique (molecular genetic technique); Sequencing technique (determining the nucleotide sequence); HI technique (technique to prevent hemagglutination); ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent) technique; Virus isolation techniques; Micronutrient neutralization technique\nInfluenza A H5N1 was detected through clinical diagnostic tests\n\nHow to treat influenza A H5N1\nWhen infected with H5N1 influenza, patients need to quickly receive medical care and timely treatment, as soon as possible within 48 hours from the onset of symptoms to limit the risk of the disease getting worse. In all cases, the antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is often used because it has the ability to help reduce the severity of the disease, thereby reducing the risk of death. If Tamiflu is not available or does not respond, zanamivir (Relenza) can be used to treat H5N1 in humans.\nWith symptoms such as high fever, cough with phlegm, joint pain, etc., the patient will take additional medications as prescribed by the doctor such as fever reducers, anti-inflammatory corticosteroids, and antibiotics.\nTo the extent that the disease can be treated at home, some of the actions below will help patients shorten the duration of infection.\nTake plenty of time to rest; Live in a well-ventilated environment, the room temperature is not too hot or cold, limit air-conditioned rooms; Pay attention to hygiene and disinfect your throat with diluted salt water several times a day; Should be combined with nasal spray to limit respiratory infections; Eat cooked food and drink boiled food, prioritize foods/dishes that are easy to digest, rich in nutrients, and drink plenty of water.\n\nHow to prevent influenza A H5N1\nCurrently, the vaccine to prevent influenza A H5N1 is still in the development stage and not yet widely available. Both specific and preventive medications are still being researched. Therefore, to prevent H5N1, we need to focus on the following factors:\nPersonal hygiene and dietary hygiene: Do not consume products from sick poultry, thoroughly cook poultry/poultry products, clean/disinfect the nose and throat every day.; Limit close contact with sick people and infected poultry. If contact is necessary, you must wear disease prevention equipment (mask, glasses, hat, protective clothing) and wash your hands before and after contact.; Improve health: Eating, resting, and exercising in moderation are ways to help improve health in general and the immune system in particular; From there, the ability to resist disease will improve.\n\nFrequently asked questions about influenza A H5N1\nWho is at risk of getting influenza A H5N1?\nSubjects at high risk of being infected with influenza A H5N1 are mainly limited to people who have close and frequent contact with poultry/poultry waste carrying the virus. In this case, children will be at higher risk of getting the disease than adults. In addition, people traveling to countries with H5N1 avian flu outbreaks may also be infected.\nAnother very small percentage are people living in a household where a member is infected with H5N1. This is why it is very important to detect and treat patients early as well as localize close contacts for control.\nCan influenza A H5N1 be transmitted from person to person?\nHuman-to-human transmission of H5N1 infection is very rare, but it is possible. The first case of human-to-human transmission was reported in 1997 after an outbreak in Hong Kong. (4)\nWhen to see a doctor?\nWhenever there are warning signs of H5N1 flu infection such as fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue, etc., you should see a doctor to diagnose whether you are really infected with flu A or not. If you are sick, early detection like this will help make treatment, monitoring and care more effective; The risk of complications or danger to life is also significantly reduced.\nWith no vaccine available, H5N1 influenza is still a significant threat to public health. Maintain hygiene and improve health; Being careful when eating and interacting with poultry are effective measures to help protect yourself and the community. More importantly, when there are any unusual symptoms related to fever and cough, it is necessary to conduct a health check early to be able to promptly detect the disease if infected with the virus.",
