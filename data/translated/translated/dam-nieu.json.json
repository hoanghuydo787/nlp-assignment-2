    "content": "Proteinuria: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment\n\nProteinuria, also known as proteinuria, is a disease related to the urinary system, mainly due to the kidneys. The typical clinical symptom is foamy urination due to protein appearing in the urine, and most patients do not have other unusual symptoms. The disease is a sign that the kidneys are damaged. Patients need to treat the disease as soon as it is detected, to avoid prolonged proteinuria, which will increase the risk of chronic kidney failure.\n\nWhat is proteinuria?\nProteinuria is a condition in which protein abnormally appears in the urine, causing foamy urine. (first)\nThis protein is usually albumin, a substance found in human plasma, which plays a role in preventing fluid from leaving the blood vessels, while also helping to maintain the stability of colloid osmotic pressure. Besides, albumin also helps bind and transport substances in the human body.\nAlbumin in particular and protein in general can be considered important substances, helping to build muscle tissue and fight infection. However, proteins must be in the blood to perform their function. When protein gets mixed into the urine, this is a sign that the kidneys are damaged and functionally impaired.\nA healthy kidney will not let protein or albumin pass from the blood into the urine in abnormal amounts. Therefore, proteinuria is a precursor to persistent kidney diseases.\nIf the disease is detected at an early stage, it can be completely treated, but patients also need to be aware of maintaining stable kidney health with appropriate nutrition and lifestyle to prevent disease recurrence. If proteinuria persists for a long time without treatment, kidney damage will become more serious, not only causing significant protein loss, but over time will increase the risk of chronic kidney failure in humans.\nThe amount of protein in the urine of healthy people is >150mg/day. People with proteinuria will have a protein index greater than 150mg/day. It should be noted that if this index is about 3 - 3.5g/day, this is a sign of nephrotic syndrome.\n\nCause of proteinuria\nThe cause of proteinuria is damage that affects the kidney's blood filtering function. In these cases, patients need to take treatment as prescribed by their doctor immediately to prevent the disease from affecting the kidneys more seriously.\nHowever, there are still benign cases where proteinuria appears due to sudden changes in the body such as excessive exercise, fever, etc. This proteinuria condition is temporary and can go away on its own and does not require treatment. treat.\nCauses of proteinuria include:\nProteinuria due to primary or secondary glomerular disease. People with diseases such as membranous nephropathy, minimal change glomerular disease, diabetic nephropathy, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, lupus inflammation, etc. will experience proteinuria as a symptom of kidney damage. love; Proteinuria is of renal tubular origin. Occurs in people who have or have had tubulointerstitial nephritis, polycystic kidney disease, fanconi syndrome and acute tubular necrosis; Proteinuria due to absorption overload. This phenomenon of proteinuria is due to the body receiving large amounts of small-weight plasma proteins. This leads to overload for the body, causing protein to overflow. Proteinuria due to absorption overload often occurs in people with monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, myelodysplastic syndrome or multiple myeloma; Functional proteinuria is a benign type of proteinuria. The disease can appear in people with fever, excessive exercise, heart failure, and pregnant women. This is a temporary type of proteinuria, the patient may not need examination and treatment. However, you need to pay attention to symptoms and changes in health carefully during this time.\n\nSymptoms of proteinuria\nThe most obvious symptom of proteinuria is foamy or foamy urine. In addition, the disease also includes other symptoms related to physical weakness and changes in urination frequency.\nMost proteinuria will not have any symptoms in the beginning, so it will be difficult for patients to detect it at first through clinical signs. The disease will begin to show symptoms after a while, those symptoms are:\nSwelling of the face, abdomen, feet and ankles; Preeclampsia in pregnant patients; Foamy urine; Increased frequency of abnormal urination; Shortness of breath, fatigue; Nausea and vomiting; Anorexia; Cramps, often occurring in the evening\n\nWho often suffers from proteinuria?\nProteinuria can occur in people of any age. However, some groups of people will be at higher risk of getting the disease than others. Subjects susceptible to proteinuria include:\nElderly people, over 65 years old; People who have ever had kidney diseases; People with family members with kidney disease or a history of kidney-related diseases; People with diabetes affect the kidneys; People with systemic diseases and kidney damage (lupus erythematosus); Patients with Hypertension…\n\nRisk factors increase the likelihood of getting the disease\nThe risk factor that increases the likelihood of developing proteinuria is kidney diseases or diabetes that affect the kidneys.\nBecause proteinuria is considered a sign of kidney damage, people with unstable kidney health and a history of kidney disease are at higher risk of proteinuria than others.\nIn addition, people with an unscientific diet and lifestyle that negatively impacts the kidneys such as a diet that is too salty, too much salt, drinks little water, and has the habit of holding urine are also at high risk of proteinuria. .\n\nIs proteinuria dangerous?\nProteinuria is not a serious disease if detected and treated promptly.\nMost of the time, the phenomenon of abnormally high amounts of protein in the urine is an alarm of kidney damage, leading to impaired filtering function. In this case, persistent proteinuria will mean long-term, untreated kidney damage.\nFrom here, the risk of complicated kidney-related diseases will also gradually increase over time. Furthermore, the disease will also come with serious symptoms, affecting the patient's quality of life.\nBenign, functional proteinuria caused by excessive exercise or fever will not be dangerous to the patient's kidney health. However, patients still need to pay attention to their health to avoid letting the disease prolong or get worse.\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nProteinuria needs to be treated as soon as possible, so patients need to see a doctor as soon as they discover they have symptoms of proteinuria.\nBecause of self-diagnosing the type of proteinuria at home, it is difficult for patients to know what type of proteinuria they have, whether it affects the kidneys or not. It is essential to immediately see a doctor when you suspect proteinuria so that the patient can receive timely treatment, ensure kidney health and reduce possible risks.\n\nHow is proteinuria diagnosed?\nDiagnosis of proteinuria is based on urine test results. Test indicators will visually show the amount of protein in urine, kidney condition and disease prognosis. There are 3 methods to diagnose proteinuria: qualitative diagnosis, semi-quantitative diagnosis and quantitative proteinuria diagnosis.\n1. Qualitative diagnosis\nQualitative diagnosis is a way to determine the disease by coagulating protein in urine. Protein is coagulated by burning urine or cooling with sulfosalicylipue. At high temperatures, protein has a coagulation mechanism, from which the amount of protein in urine can be seen with the naked eye.\nIn addition, when the urine of a person with proteinuria is burned, it will cloud the urine. This is also a paraclinical symptom for doctors to diagnose and conclude the disease.\n2. Semi-quantitative diagnosis\nSemi-quantitative diagnosis of proteinuria is simply a method of determining the existence of protein in the patient's urine. This is a simple diagnostic method, using only urine test strips.\nThe test strip contains substances that react with protein, so when exposed to urine containing an unusually high amount of protein, the strip will change color.\n3. Diagnosis of quantitative proteinuria\nQuantitative proteinuria diagnosis has the advantage of accurately determining the amount of protein in urine. The requirements for urine samples to be quantified are 24-hour urine. Furthermore, quantitative diagnostic results also specifically show the components of protein in urine.\nThis is very necessary diagnostic information so that doctors can determine the cause of proteinuria, the location of kidney damage and the current functional status of the kidney.\n\nTreatment methods for proteinuria\nTreatment for proteinuria will depend on the cause of the disease. The cause and severity of the disease are the main factors for doctors to establish a proteinuria treatment regimen. (3)\nAnd it should be noted that proteinuria in particular and kidney diseases in general will require treatment according to doctor's instructions combined with nutrition and daily living habits. This helps improve kidney function and stabilize long-term kidney health. The purpose of appropriate nutrition is not only to help promote disease treatment but also to minimize the risk of relapse.\nSome common proteinuria treatments are:\nProteinuria due to kidney damage: The disease is mainly treated medically with medication, combined with appropriate dietary changes to improve kidney health.; Proteinuria due to diabetes requires medication as prescribed by your doctor, while controlling blood sugar levels. Nutritional factors are still important in treatment regimens; Benign functional proteinuria may not require treatment, and the disease can go away on its own without medical intervention.\n\nWhat should patients do to take care of themselves when treating proteinuria?\n1. Lifestyle for people with proteinuria\nThe lifestyle for people with proteinuria focuses on improving the body's resistance. Stabilizing the health of the whole body will also help stabilize kidney health and prevent the possibility of injury and inflammation caused by bacteria and viruses.\nThe lifestyle that people with proteinuria should follow:\nExercise regularly, increase movement during the day; Regularly check blood sugar levels to limit the risk of diabetes; Stop using tobacco or minimize passive smoking to protect kidney health; Minimize the arbitrary use of anti-inflammatory drugs and pain relievers without a doctor's prescription\n2. Diet for people with proteinuria\nDiet for people with proteinuria plays an important role in the treatment process. Proper nutrition will help prevent further kidney damage, reduce the severity of the disease and ultimately contribute to improving kidney health and increasing blood filtering ability.\nDiet for people with proteinuria is:\nLimit eating foods that are too rich in protein; Limit salt intake. However, people with a history of hypotension should consult their doctor about the maximum amount of salt they need to consume in a day; Eat plenty of fiber to balance blood sugar and lower cholesterol\nCenter for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology - Urology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts, Internal Medicine and Surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
