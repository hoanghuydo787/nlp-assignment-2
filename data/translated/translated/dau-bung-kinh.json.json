    "content": "Dysmenorrhea: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis and prevention\n\nDysmenorrhea is a common phenomenon that occurs during menstruation in women. The level of pain varies from person to person, some people only have mild pain, while others have more serious pain. So what kind of menstrual cramps is normal and when should you see a doctor right away?\n\nWhat is menstrual cramps?\nDysmenorrhea, also known as dysmenorrhea, is a medical term referring to the condition of painful contractions and cramps in the lower abdomen, often occurring before and during menstruation due to uterine contractions. . This is a common phenomenon during the menstrual cycle in women.\nAccording to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), more than half of women experience menstrual cramps 1-2 days each month. Usually the pain is mild, but some women experience more severe pain that prevents them from performing daily activities and work for several days. (first)\nMore than half of women experience abdominal pain before and during menstruation\n\nClassification of dysmenorrhea\nDysmenorrhea is classified into two types: primary and secondary.\nPrimary dysmenorrhea: refers to pain that occurs repeatedly during each menstrual cycle and is not due to disease. The pain usually starts about 1-2 days before your period or when your period begins.\nPrimary dysmenorrhea usually lasts 24-48 hours and gradually subsides. It may be accompanied by other symptoms such as mild to severe pain in the lower abdomen, back or thighs; or experience nausea and vomiting, fatigue and even diarrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea will begin immediately after a woman begins menstruation, then will gradually decrease as the woman gets older or may stop completely after childbirth.\nSecondary dysmenorrhea: refers to pain related to disorders or infections in the female reproductive organs, such as uterine fibroids, endometriosis, uterine adenoma... Dysmenorrhea Secondary usually begins earlier in the menstrual cycle and lasts longer than usual. In addition, women will not feel nausea, vomiting, fatigue or diarrhea.\n\nCauses of menstrual cramps\nNormally, eggs will be released regularly every month. In case the sperm meets the egg and fertilizes it, the fertilized egg will move through the fallopian tube to the uterus to implant and develop into a fetus. If the sperm does not meet the egg and fertilization does not occur, the uterus contracts to push the lining and the egg out of the body, which is called menstruation.\nWhen the uterine wall contracts, the blood vessels in the uterine lining will be compressed, leading to a lack of oxygen in the uterine tissues, causing the release of substances that cause stronger uterine contractions, making women feel more pain. (2)\nBesides, in the first days of menstruation, the body will increase the production of another chemical mediator called prostaglandin. This substance causes the uterine muscles to contract more with greater force, leading to increased pain levels during this time.\nIn addition to the above causes, having a number of diseases can increase the severity of menstrual cramps, including:\nFibroids;; Endometrial optimism;; Uterine gland disease;; Cervical stenosis;; Pelvic inflammation.\nDoctor Thanh Thao shared that some women have more severe menstrual cramps after having an IUD inserted. An IUD is a device made from copper and plastic that is placed into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. After placing the IUD, women may have abdominal pain, but this phenomenon only appears in the first 3-4 months, when the uterus has accepted and gotten used to the IUD, the pain will gradually decrease.\nSome gynecological diseases such as uterine fibroids, endometriosis, cervical stenosis... can cause abdominal pain every month.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of menstrual cramps?\nTypical symptoms of dysmenorrhea are dull pain in the lower abdomen, which can be cramping or severe pain. Normally, abdominal pain will appear 1-2 days before or during menstruation, the pain level is highest in the first 24 hours and then gradually decreases after about 2-3 days. The pain will be proportional to the degree of uterine contraction, and can spread to the waist and thighs. (3)\nIn addition, women may also experience other symptoms such as:\nNausea;; Headache;; Tired;; Diarrhea or constipation depending on the condition.\nReference: Where is menstrual cramps normal?\n\nIs menstrual cramps dangerous?\nDoctor Thanh Thao shared that menstrual pain that starts early before the period and lasts longer than normal menstrual pain can be a sign that women are suffering from a dangerous disease, including: arrive:\nUterine fibroids: benign tumors that put pressure on the uterus, causing menstrual disorders and dysmenorrhea. Women with this disease will experience many unpleasant symptoms such as lower abdominal pain, pelvic pain, difficulty urinating, constipation, menorrhagia, hypermenorrhea...; Endometriosis: Endometriosis can appear in the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, lower digestive tract or bladder. These endometrial tissue growths will cause swelling, inflammation and bleeding at the \"stray\" site, causing pain during menstruation.; Cervical stenosis: a narrow cervix will make blood circulation during menstruation more difficult, leading to women feeling more abdominal pain.; Salpingitis: This disease affects the pelvis, so women will feel abdominal pain before and during menstruation, pain may not be related to menstruation. In addition, salpingitis also causes many other symptoms such as menstrual disorders, vaginal discharge with strange colors, dizziness, nausea...; Cervical cancer: in the early stages, cancer often has no obvious symptoms. When cancer cells grow stronger, they can cause many other symptoms such as severe menstrual cramps, pelvic pain, and back pain. During intercourse, vaginal discharge is abnormal... so women should not be subjective.\nYou may be interested in: How long does menstrual cramps last?\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nAlthough dysmenorrhea is a common phenomenon during menstruation in women, women need to immediately go to a medical facility to be examined and examined to find the cause in the following situations: (4)\nSevere abdominal pain, affecting daily activities and work; Pain symptoms become more and more severe.; Severe pain.\nWomen need to see a doctor immediately if their symptoms of menstrual cramps become more severe\n\nDiagnosis of menstrual cramps\nFirst, the doctor will examine your general health and gynecological examination, and collect information about your personal medical history and family history to detect risk factors. During a gynecological examination, the doctor will conduct an examination and detect abnormalities in the reproductive organs, if any.\nIn case secondary dysmenorrhea is suspected to be related to a medical condition, the doctor will ask women to participate in some necessary tests, which may include:\nUltrasound: to see images of the uterus, cervix, ovaries and fallopian tubes.; Scan CT, MRI or combine CT and X-ray depending on each specific case.; Laparoscopy: detects uterine fibroids, endometriosis, ovarian cysts or ectopic pregnancy.\n\nHow to reduce menstrual pain?\nTo minimize menstrual pain, women can apply the following solutions:\nUse a warm compress to place on the lower abdomen; Bathe with warm water.; Practice relaxation and psychological relief exercises such as meditation, yoga...; Do not drink alcohol, smoke or use stimulants because they can increase pain.; Getting enough sleep and resting properly is also a way to minimize the discomfort of menstrual cramps.; Use menstrual pain relievers.
