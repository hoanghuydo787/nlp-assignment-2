    "content": "What is a vasomotor headache? Symptoms, causes and treatments\n\nVasomotor headaches characterized by migraines are a health condition that can occur in many people. Women are more easily affected than men. So, where is it?\nCauses of vasomotor headaches\n?\nSymptoms of vasomotor headache\ninclude\n things?\nComplications of vasomotor headache\n good\n Is vasomotor headache dangerous?\n?\n\nWhat is a vasomotor headache?\nVasomotor headaches are conditions related to \"dilated\" changes in blood vessels in the head or neck area. Specifically, when the blood vessels in the head are stretched/dilated and inflamed, it will change the normal rhythm of the pulse and lead to sharp pain. If the patient is physically active at this time, the headache will become even more severe. (first)\nVasomotor headaches involve dilated blood vessels that cause changes in heart rate\n\nSymptoms of vasomotor headache\nSymptoms of migraine\nMigraines are the most common sign of vasomotor headaches; especially occurs in women and young people. Some rarer cases may occur in children. The disease can be episodic or chronic.\nAccording to health experts, this can be a primary or secondary headache. Migraines can last from a few hours to a few days. When suffering from migraine, patients often have symptoms such as throbbing pain on one side of the head, nausea, dizziness, vision effects, loss of appetite, or restlessness and anxiety, etc.\nHormone disorders, insomnia, weather changes, side effects of some medications, caffeine or alcoholic beverage abuse, etc. are high risk factors for migraines. (2)\nSymptoms of cluster headaches\nCluster headaches are a primary type of headache caused by neurovascular effects and are not a common form of vasomotor headache. Men from 20-40 years old are common subjects. Cluster headaches often occur in the head area above the eyes or in the temples; Usually takes about 30 minutes to 2 hours.\nIn addition to blood vessel dilation, some other causes related to cluster headache symptoms of vasomotor headache may be the activity of the immune system, circadian rhythm, autonomic nervous system,...\nThe pain caused by cluster headaches can appear at any time of the day, even in the middle of the night, causing the patient to feel intense burning pain. Other symptoms of headaches include: forehead sweating, watery eyes, swollen/droopy eyelids, stuffy nose, etc.\nCluster headaches often occur in the temples or the area above the eyes\nHeadache due to illness\nThere are many diseases that can cause patients to have symptoms of vasomotor headaches, such as flu, colds, high blood pressure, insomnia, etc. Depending on the different disease conditions, they will cause different levels of headaches. . In most cases, after treating the initial condition, the headaches will also be resolved.\n\nCauses of vasomotor headaches\nThere are many causes that can trigger a vasomotor headache, the most common include:\nBeer, wine and alcoholic beverages; Excessive stress and anxiety; Weather changes lead to changes in air pressure; Change in circadian rhythm (wake up or sleep too much), exercise with unusual intensity; Hormonal changes in women during menstruation and premenopause; Foods such as fast food, chocolate, foods containing many additives, etc.; Use medicine\n\nAre vasomotor headaches dangerous?\nAnyone can experience vasomotor pain or headaches. The disease is usually not life-threatening, but if it occurs continuously over a long period of time, it is a warning sign of many health problems. As it progresses to chronicity with a frequency of 2-3 pain attacks per week, vasomotor headaches have a higher risk of causing complications.\nFirst, it has a significant impact on daily life, reducing the patient's quality of life. Next is the abnormal elasticity of the brain's blood vessels, causing a lack of oxygen and nutrients supplied to brain cells. This can easily lead to symptoms such as dizziness, shaking hands and feet, headaches, etc.\nMore dangerously, lack of oxygen for 4-5 minutes can cause permanent damage to brain cells leading to stroke, death or serious consequences: memory loss, hemiplegia and many neurological diseases. other.\nWhat are the complications of vasomotor headaches? Or are vasomotor headaches dangerous? If the disease is not treated early, it can lead to a series of problems such as impaired cerebral circulatory function, brain atrophy, depression, memory loss, brain tumors and, in the worst case, it can affect human life. sick.\nSevere vasomotor headaches cause many negative effects on brain cells\n\nDiagnosis of vasomotor headache\nBased on symptoms, family history and response to certain medications, the doctor will make a specific diagnosis about vasomotor headache. Diagnostic \"criteria\" may vary depending on the type of headache the patient experiences. (3)\nMigraine: Obtain a medical history and may perform a physical/neurological examination.; Tension headaches: Diagnosis based on symptoms.; Cluster headaches: Although there is no test used to diagnose cluster headaches, the doctor will make a conclusion depending on the pain type of each person.; Related to other diseases: Based on current medical condition.\n\nHow to treat vasomotor headaches\nDepending on the type of vasomotor headache, there are many different treatment methods.\nYou can reduce the severity and frequency of headaches by drinking plenty of water, taking time to rest, trying to relax/reduce stress, and using over-the-counter/prescription medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, ergotamines, triptans, gepants,…\nIn addition to medication, in the case of severe, persistent headaches, the patient may also be treated with other methods such as oxygen therapy, physical therapy, nerve stimulation or surgery to alleviate the condition.\nIn daily activities, patients with vasomotor headaches should also abstain from alcohol, eat enough meals, go to bed early, apply cool compresses, reduce time using electronic devices, etc.\n\nHow to prevent vasomotor headaches?\nCompletely preventing headaches is difficult; However, we can prevent and reduce the amount of pain.\nThe basic things to do to prevent vasomotor headaches are to reduce stress, increase headache-relieving foods (for example: dark green leafy vegetables, fruits, foods rich in omega-3, herbal teas). , yogurt,...) and medication use (eg anticonvulsants, beta blockers, calcium blockers, antidepressants, Botox injections,...).\nRegarding medicine, before using any medicine, patients need to examine and seek advice from a doctor. Using medication indiscriminately when having a vasomotor headache can lead to a high risk of unwanted side effects.\nCurrently, the Department of Neurology, Neurology Center of Tam Anh General Hospital System is one of the typical specialties in examining and treating neurological diseases such as headaches, left-sided migraines, migraines. right head,... Department of Neurology brings together a team of leading, experienced, and skilled experts and doctors along with modern equipment and machinery to help diagnose and screen neurological diseases. effective and safe.\nTo schedule an examination and consultation on health issues at Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nHeadaches in general and vasomotor headaches in particular are health problems that should not be ignored, especially when the pain is severe or recurs many times. To prevent negative effects on the nerves, it is best to see a doctor early when you have a prolonged headache for timely diagnosis and treatment.",
