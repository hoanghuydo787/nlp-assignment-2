    "content": "What is a headache? Causes and symptoms should be noted\n\nCrown pain is one of the common types of headaches. Not simply due to insomnia or stress, headache can also be related to many other serious health problems such as high blood pressure or stroke.\n\nWhat is a headache?\nCrown pain is a dull or sudden headache at the top of the head. Most people experience this type of headache one or more times for many different reasons. Head pain can occur within a few minutes but can also last for a long time, significantly affecting the patient's health. If treatment is not sought, the disease can lead to many dangerous complications.\n\nSymptoms of headache\nWhen having pain on the top of the head, the patient feels like there is a heavy object pressing firmly on the top of the head, causing sharp pain. In some people, crown pain also leads to other symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, jaw pain, neck pain, sensitivity to noise/light, etc.\nIn rarer cases involving dangerous diseases, the patient not only has pain in the top of the head but may also experience nosebleeds, difficulty breathing or anxiety disorders.\nPeople with head pain may experience dizziness and nausea\n\nCommon causes of headache\nThere are many causes of headache, of which the most common include:\nDue to stress\nWhen under pressure for a long time, it can easily lead to headaches. In addition, excessive stress can also cause headaches in the temples or neck area. The pain is usually dull, not throbbing and less severe. Despite the headache, the patient can still live normally.\nThese types of headaches usually last for a short period of time, about 30 minutes and can last up to 1 week. (first)\nMigraine headache\nThis is a neurological disease characterized by pain on one side of the head, the top of the head or the back of the neck with moderate to severe intensity, affecting daily activities and making the body tired. tired. Migraines can manifest as throbbing and pulsating pain, each lasting from a few hours to 2-3 days, or become chronic - accompanied by nausea, vomiting, sensitive to light/sound,...\nChronic headache\nChronic headaches are headaches that last for 15 days or more. Chronic headaches come in many different forms, including persistent pain at the top of the head.\nCluster headaches\nHeadaches occur in “clusters” and recur daily, sometimes weekly. The pain is usually in the area around or behind the eye socket on one side or spreads to the top of the head and occurs almost at the same time of day (usually in the evening), lasting about 20 minutes to 3 hours, with intensity. intensity.\nCluster headaches can be accompanied by symptoms of drooping eyelids, redness and watery eyes, stuffy or runny nose. The cause of this disease is not yet clearly understood, but some problems such as sleep disorders, alcohol/tobacco abuse or history of trauma are considered high risk factors. (2)\nHeadache due to sinusitis\nSinus infection can lead to pain on one or both sides or at the top of the head. If sinusitis is treated well, headache symptoms will gradually decrease. Using medication or surgery are two common methods of treating sinusitis.\nSee more: Headache due to sinusitis: Symptoms, treatment and prevention.\nSinusitis is one of the diseases that can cause pain at the top of the head\nHeadache due to cold stimulation\nHeadaches caused by cold stimulation are also called \"brain freeze\" phenomena. The pain often appears when the body is suddenly exposed to cold temperatures such as eating ice cream, drinking ice water, etc., causing stimulation of the trigeminal nerve, creating severe or sharp pain on the top of the head that occurs during the period of time. short time (about a few seconds).\nHeadache due to insomnia\nLack of sleep or poor sleep can also cause headaches. Decreased sleep quality can cause disorders in the production of neurotransmitters, including orexin - a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in sleep and creates excitement. Like a vicious cycle, headaches disrupt sleep; Therefore, it can make headaches persistent or worse.\nHeadache at night\nNocturnal headaches occur when the patient wakes up during the night, usually at the same time. Pain like this usually lasts at least 15 minutes and affects people over 50 years of age.\nAlthough the cause is unknown, many information suggest that this symptom of crown pain is related to the ability to control pain, REM sleep (rapid eye movement sleep - also known as dream sleep) or Melatonin production mechanism (hormone that helps regulate the body's circadian rhythm).\nOccipital neuralgia\nThis problem involves stimulating the nerves leading from the spine to the top of the head, so there is a risk of causing back pain or pain at the top of the head. The cause may be due to an injury to the back of the head, neck strain/osteoarthritis causing nerve compression, or a tumor in the neck.\n\nOther causes of crown pain\nSome other less common causes that can still cause headaches include:\nReversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome\nThis is a syndrome of cerebral artery spasm with clinical signs such as sudden, severe headache. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome has a high risk of causing cerebral edema, seizures or stroke – which can lead to disability or death.\nHeadache due to high blood pressure\nUsually high blood pressure does not cause headaches. However, in the case of a sudden increase in blood pressure (from 180/120mmHg or more), the patient may present with headache, pulsating pain, accompanied by physical symptoms such as chest tightness, blurred vision, difficulty breathing. breathing, nosebleeds.\nHeadache due to drug abuse\nExcessive use of over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription pain relievers can lead to headaches; including crown pain or persistent migraine.\nOveruse of pain relievers has the risk of causing persistent headaches or crown pain\nHeadache caused by exercise\nSome people are susceptible to pain at the top of their head when exercising at high intensity – even during sexual activity. Pain like this is called exertional headache and the main cause may be a rapid increase in blood pressure.\nHowever, there is evidence that exercise can help reduce headaches if a source of protein is consumed about an hour and a half before exercise; Warm up and drink enough water before and during/after exercise. If you often have headaches - not just pain at the top of your head - when exercising, you should see a doctor soon to find out more about the cause.\nLack of blood flow to the brain\nAnemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells circulating in the blood is lower than normal. This leads to a lack of oxygen being transported to the brain, causing the risk of headaches, including crown pain. The cause of anemia can be due to iron deficiency, vitamin deficiency or related to thalassemia.\nDue to seasonal weather changes\nChanges in weather lead to changes in atmospheric pressure. This can be the cause of headache symptoms in many people and can be accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.\nSee more:\nWhat is frontal migraine? The cause and how to fix it.; What is posterior migraine? Causes, diagnosis and treatment.\n\nDangerous complications of headache need to be alert\nSome dangerous diseases may have warning signs such as headaches. If the pain becomes severe, there can be potentially dangerous complications such as increased blood pressure, ischemia to the brain, and stroke.\n\nHow to treat headaches\nTreatment of crown pain is related to treating and controlling the causes and factors that cause the disease. Accordingly:\nConventional treatment\nCommon treatments for vertex pain include over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, muscle relaxants, and triptans.\nAlthough effective, these medications also have many side effects or interact with other common medications, so you should consult your doctor if you need to use the medication more than 3 days a week.\nAntidepressants may also be used in cases of crown headaches associated with occipital neuralgia. Calcium channel blockers may help reduce headaches associated with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. Headaches caused by high blood pressure may require antihypertensive medications as quickly as possible or emergency treatment to reduce the risk of brain bleeding, stroke, or other dangerous conditions.\nChiropractic treatment\nThis is a way to treat headaches without using many medications.\nPain on the top of the head in many cases originates from incorrect living posture and problems with the position of the cervical vertebrae. The top two cervical vertebrae, the occipital bone, and the bone at the base of the skull are closely related to headaches. Therefore, knowing how to adjust chiropractic will be one of the best ways to treat headaches - especially recurrent pain.\nThe adjustment helps align the upper cervical spine; keeps the neck and head bones, nerves and muscles in the correct position; thereby eliminating the main cause of headaches.\nAdjusting the cervical vertebrae is one way to help reduce crown pain\nOther treatment directions\nMassage, warm bath, head massage, acupuncture or changing lying/working position, etc. are also methods that can be helpful in relieving symptoms of crown pain.\n\nHow to prevent headaches\nSome factors are triggers that cause headaches that you can control such as food, drinks, etc. Specifically, if you do the following things, you will significantly reduce the risk of headaches in general and peak pain. head in particular.\nGet enough sleep: Lack of sleep is one of the biggest causes of headaches. You should try to get enough sleep every night, this not only helps reduce pain but is also good for overall health.; Reduce stress: Practicing yoga, meditation, exercising or spending time paying attention to those around you are ways to help relax the mind to partly reduce stress levels.; Limit alcohol and stimulants: Drinking too much alcohol can easily cause headaches. If you want to reduce pain, you should consider reducing or quitting alcohol completely.; Consume a steady level of caffeine: Consuming more or less than your usual amount of caffeine can give you headaches. It's best if you're used to drinking caffeinated drinks to keep them at a steady amount.\n\nWhen do you need to see a doctor?\nHead pain is not always a dangerous sign. However, according to the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, if a person has a headache in the following cases, they should see a doctor soon: (3)\nHeadache with fever; Severe, sudden headache; Sudden headache accompanied by stiff neck; Head pain occurs with convulsions; Headache with confusion, loss of consciousness; Pain in the top of the head combined with pain in the ears or eyes; Feeling like there is a “knock” in the head; Persistent headache; Headaches recur many times in children\nThe Department of Neurology of the Neurology Center, Tam Anh General Hospital System is one of the typical specialties in the examination and treatment of neurological diseases such as headaches, left-sided migraines, and right-sided migraines. ,... Department of Neurology brings together a team of leading, experienced and skilled doctors and experts along with modern equipment and machinery to help diagnose and screen neurological diseases effectively, safe.\nTo schedule an examination and consultation on health issues at Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nHead pain can be a worrying health warning sign.
