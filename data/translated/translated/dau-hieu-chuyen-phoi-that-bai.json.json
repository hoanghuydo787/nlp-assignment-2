The Reproductive Support Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City encourages patients to transfer one embryo.

The embryo transfer process is divided into two stages: Pre-embryo transfer stage: includes the preparation period of the endometrial layer, early embryo separation and embryo implantation into the uterus. Embryo transfer stage: the embryo attaches to the uterine lining.\n\nWhat are the signs of unsuccessful embryo transfer?\nAfter embryo transfer, patients are often prescribed medications by doctors to support implantation and help the embryo develop. These drugs can cause symptoms of abdominal pain, breast tenderness, nausea, some people feel like morning sickness... However, all of these signs are not early signs of pregnancy. Early and most accurate diagnosis of pregnancy is based on the beta hCG blood test after embryo transfer (usually taken 12 days after embryo transfer).\nSee more: How many days does it take to get results after a pregnancy test after embryo transfer?\n\nCauses of embryo transfer failure\nThe causes of embryo implantation failure are very diverse and can be divided into 3 main groups of causes: embryo abnormalities, endometrial abnormalities, and embryo-uterine mucosal interaction abnormalities.\n1. Embryonic causes\nThe embryo is combined from egg and sperm. If either of these two factors is of poor quality, a \"weak in the egg\" embryo will be created. At that time, failure after embryo transfer is understandable.\nEmbryo quality was assessed during culture. At that time, the doctor will observe the embryo's development process and evaluate its quality when the embryo is 3 and 5 days old.\nFor 3-day-old embryos: the doctor will rely on the criteria of quantity, cell size and fragmentation of the embryo to evaluate whether the embryo is good or not. Type 1 embryos are the best embryos, with a high chance of success. Type 2 embryos are average, type 3 are poor, low success rate.; For 5-day-old embryos: the evaluation criterion is the size of the blastocyst sinus. Good embryos will have larger sinuses than other embryos (at the same time of evaluation). There is also the quantity and quality of cells in different parts of the embryo. Good embryos are embryos with many cells, compacted and not fragmented.\nBased on the results of embryo quality analysis, the doctor will conclude whether the embryo is of sufficient quality to proceed with embryo transfer or not. If the embryos are of poor quality, the IVF cycle will be postponed to wait for good embryos.\n2. Abnormalities of the uterine lining\nThe uterine lining is a thin layer that surrounds the inner surface of the uterus, plays an important role in the conception process and will change size (thicken or thin) at different times in the cycle. woman's menstrual period.\nUterine lining that is too thick or too thin has a negative effect on the conception process. A thickness of 8-13mm of uterine lining is considered ideal for conception. If the uterine lining at the time of embryo transfer is <7mm thick, the failure rate will be higher.\nIn addition to size, some factors that reduce the receptivity of the uterine lining include:\nChronic inflammation of the lining of the uterus; Abnormalities in the uterine cavity, such as polyps, uterine septa, or uterine adhesions; Embryo transfer occurs early (before implantation) or late (after implantation).\nInflammation of the uterine lining and abnormalities in the uterine lining are risk factors for multiple embryo transfer failures\n3. Abnormal embryo-uterine lining interaction\nThere are patients who, despite having good quality embryos, beautiful morphological uterine lining on ultrasound, and normal hysteroscopic examination, still cannot conceive after embryo transfer. The problem may lie in abnormal embryo-uterine lining interactions. A minor aspect of this anomaly is the deviation of the nesting window.\nThis process can be simply explained as follows: for the embryo to attach and develop in the uterine cavity, the embryo must be transferred to the uterus at a stage where the uterine lining is capable of receiving the embryo. This stage may vary from patient to patient.\nCurrently, there are many advanced techniques and therapies that help improve uterine lining thickness. In particular, using autologous platelet-rich plasma is a modern method being applied at the Reproductive Support Center of Tam Anh General Hospital System. This method will increase the success rate of IVF for cases at risk of difficulty implanting the fetus due to thin uterine lining or reduced acceptance of the uterine lining.\n\nMethods to help increase the rate of successful embryo transfer\nWhen the doctor informs you that the embryo transfer process has failed, it does not mean that everything is over and you and your husband cannot have children. Doctors always perform techniques to maximize the success rate for each embryo transfer, and the appointment of these techniques will be based on many factors: history, medical history, number of embryos, quality. embryo, characteristics of the previous mucosa preparation cycle... then consider implementing some techniques to help increase the success rate of embryo transfer. Those techniques are:\n1. Treat uterine abnormalities\nTo facilitate embryo implantation, all abnormalities in the uterine cavity such as uterine adhesions, uterine septa, double uterus, uterine fibroids... need to be treated if there is evidence. causal relationship between these abnormalities and adverse outcomes after embryo transfer.\n2. Blastocyst culture\nAccording to statistics, the success rate of day 5 embryo transfer is 1.35 times higher than day 3 embryo transfer. Day 5 embryos are usually of good quality, because only relatively good embryos can develop. to day 5. Embryo transfer on day 5 will be more physiological, with a higher ability to adhere to the uterine lining for implantation. Embryo culture on day 5 combined with embryo screening in patients with the right indications helps increase the chance of having a baby, reducing the rate of miscarriage and miscarriage. Day 5 embryo transfer also helps limit the possibility of multiple pregnancies because each day 5 embryo transfer, the doctor will transfer a few embryos while still ensuring a high pregnancy rate.\n3. Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) screens for chromosomal abnormalities\nChromosomal aneuploidy greatly affects the ability to implant and develop the fetus, especially in the first trimester of pregnancy. Among recorded miscarriages, the number of cases due to embryo/fetal aneuploidy is up to 70%. PGT helps screen and select euploid embryos to transfer to patients, helping to increase the pregnancy rate and reduce the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, and abnormal pregnancy.\n4. Endometrial sensitivity analysis (ERA)\nUsing the latest technology, this test helps analyze the expression levels of hundreds of genes in the uterine lining, thereby optimizing the time of embryo placement in the uterus to promote implantation and pregnancy. . This time is called the \"Window of Implantation\".\nNot only that, ERA can also detect abnormalities in the uterus. If abnormalities are found, the patient is advised to freeze blastocysts. IVF embryo transfer will be postponed until their uterine lining is more receptive to the embryo.\n\nWhat should I do after a failed embryo transfer?\nBesides implementing modern techniques, to increase the success rate of your next embryo transfer, you need to: (3)\n1. Find out the cause of failure\nKnowing the exact cause of unsuccessful embryo transfer will help choose the right treatment method to get good news soon.\nEmbryo transfer failure is related to immune problems that can be easily treated with medication. If the cause is uterine problems, treatment will vary depending on the specific case.\nIf embryo transfer failure is due to problems with the embryo, treatments include:\nEmbryo transfer 3 to 6 days after fertilization; Genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) to transfer embryos without chromosomal abnormalities.; Supports the embryo to escape membranes\nUnderstanding the cause of embryo transfer failure will help find effective solutions and help the couple soon welcome their baby\n2. Keep a comfortable spirit\nIVF is a long journey and if you and your husband are not persistent, it will be very difficult to reach the end. Therefore, mentally preparing to \"fight\" for a long time is an extremely important step. Too much hope or too much worry, impatience, stress at the beginning or depression and discouragement after unsuccessful insemination are barriers in the journey of finding a child with IVF.\nHave a healthy diet and lifestyle\nPart of the cause of failure after embryo transfer is the health status of the couple and the quality of eggs and sperm. Therefore, before entering the IVF process, you and your husband should improve your health by building a nutritional diet full of essential groups of nutrients and establishing a regular living schedule, avoiding waking up. late night, stress; Exercise regularly, travel to relax your mind.\nChoose a quality, reputable IVF center\nThere are many factors to consider before deciding to choose a place that you will trust to follow on the path to finding your beloved child: professional quality and service quality, success rate and price, equipment. machinery, doctor's qualifications, treatment regimen, technician skills, quality control procedures...\nTo choose a good IVF center, couples should not ignore 3 core criteria:\nHigh success rate\nSuccess rate is the most important criterion, so you should find out the data about that center's IVF success rate. However, this rate needs to be verified by important information such as: how many patients is the published rate based on, is the rate stable over time, and does the center receive new cases? Difficulties such as: long-term infertility, advanced age, comorbidities; Men have no sperm, immobile sperm; Do women have a deformed uterus, polycystic ovaries, ovarian failure... or not? Because if we only determine the success rate on easy cases and young patients, it is difficult to determine the true quality of this center.\nGood doctor with many years of experience in the field of assisted reproduction\nIn vitro fertilization IVF is a complex multi-step technique, requiring the doctor performing it to be not only highly specialized but also experienced. In particular, for cases with complicated causes of infertility, the doctor will have to decide whether surgery/treatment is needed before IVF or not? Is it necessary to perform specialized related techniques such as raising young eggs, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), supporting embryo escape, pre-implantation genetic testing... or not?\nDeciding on the correct treatment direction and technique will determine the success rate and help reduce costs and procedure time, but also help avoid health risks for the mother.\nThere is close connection and support between departments related to the treatment process\nIVF is a technique that needs to be coordinated between departments such as the Department of Andrology (treatment of male infertility); Reproductive Support Center (pre-fertilization treatment, performing IVF techniques); Obstetrics (care and health monitoring for mothers) and Pediatrics (health care for babies), especially the Neonatal Unit.\nTherefore, if IVF is conducted at a general hospital, the support and close connection between departments helps couples receive careful care from the time they are expecting a child, performing reproductive support until the end of their lives. giving birth, nursing and finally bringing your baby home healthily, not just stopping at successful conception.\nTam Anh General Hospital's Reproductive Support Center (IVFTA) is a gathering place for leading experts in the field of reproductive support, equipped with the most modern machinery and equipment systems, regularly updated. Update and master the most advanced assisted reproductive techniques in the world, worthy of being a reliable address for infertile couples to place their trust in.\nIVFTA owns the first super clean ISO 5 Lab in Southeast Asia. Here, embryologists can perform all advanced techniques for the assisted reproductive process such as embryo hatching (AH), preimplantation genetic screening (PGT), and embryo culture. Day 5 embryos, frozen embryos, oocytes and sperm... In particular, Tam Anh General Hospital also has inter-department coordination of IVF - Andrology - Obstetrics and Gynecology - Neonatology, helping to provide comprehensive care for both mother and baby from birth. still in the embryonic stage until the mother is a full-fledged child, taking care of the child in the first months of life.",
