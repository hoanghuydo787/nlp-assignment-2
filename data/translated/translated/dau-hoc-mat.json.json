    "content": "Eye socket pain: 17 common causes and dangerous signs\n\nEye socket pain is a symptom of many different diseases, some are relatively benign and can be cured after home treatment, but many are serious and require emergency treatment. So what is eye socket pain? What are the common causes and dangerous signs of the disease?\n\nWhat is eye socket pain?\nEye socket pain can come on suddenly, causing pain or sharp pain in the eyes and can occur in one or both eyes. Eye socket pain is not simply a feeling of eye strain due to being exposed to computers all day. They are more serious than the discomfort of a speck of dust or an eyelash falling into the eye. [first]\nIn those cases, the simple treatment is to remove eyelashes and dirt from the eyes or let the eyes rest by closing the eyes and applying cool compresses. However, orbital pain will often be more intense, last longer, and may occur with other symptoms.\nSometimes eye socket pain can be a sign of an underlying health problem or injury. You should go to the hospital or contact an ophthalmologist if the pain in your eye socket is the first time or the pain in your eye socket becomes more and more serious.\n\n17 common causes of eye socket pain\n1. Eye strain\nEye strain is a feeling of slight increased pressure or pain behind the eyes, quite common when people use computers in dark offices. Eye strain is not a specific medical condition but rather symptoms caused by constant use of the eyes. Driving, reading small text or working continuously at a computer for long periods of time can lead to temporary blurred vision, dry eyes and a feeling of pressure behind the eyes.\nDry eyes caused by not blinking enough can contribute to an itchy or painful feeling in or behind the eyes.\n2. Migraines\nPain and increased pressure around or behind the eyes are common symptoms of headaches and migraines. Other symptoms may include throbbing pain in the head, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, or seeing flashes of light before the migraine begins. Tension headaches can also make eyestrain worse.\n3. Sinusitis\nThe sinuses are located above, below, behind and between the eyes. Therefore, when sinusitis occurs, the sinuses will fill with mucus and put pressure on the surrounding areas, leading to pain in the eye sockets, nose and areas around the cheeks. Acute sinusitis is the main cause of orbital pain. Other accompanying symptoms include a runny or stuffy nose, loss of smell, headache, phlegm in the throat, fever, cough, fatigue and bad breath.\n4. Eye allergies\nAllergies to external factors such as pollen, dust or animal hair can cause eye irritation, itching and even pain if not treated promptly.\n5. Grave's disease\nAn overactive thyroid gland will cause a number of consequences such as increased eye pressure and eye socket pain. Tissue, fat and muscle throughout the body, especially around the eyes, will swell, leading to the eyes bulging.\nThis is similar to irritation around the eyes, sensitivity to light, tearing more than usual, dry eyes, double vision, eye ulcers, eye swelling, inability to move the eyes and permanent blindness.\n6. Optic neuritis\nInflammation and swelling of the optic nerve can cause orbital pain or increased pressure behind the eye. It can also cause decreased vision, color blindness, blurred vision, pain when moving the eyes, and abnormal pupil response to bright light. Optic neuritis usually peaks within a few days and visual recovery usually takes 4 â€“ 12 weeks.\n7. Corneal damage\nCorneal abrasions and ulcers can cause eye socket pain. The cornea lies on the surface of the eye and has many nerve endings, so it is extremely sensitive to pain. Scratches on the surface of the cornea due to trauma, foreign objects falling into the eye, or overuse of contact lenses can all cause corneal damage. If the wound becomes infected, recovery time will be prolonged.\n8. Chemicals or foreign objects in the eye\nEven a single piece of dust or acid falling into the eye can cause eye socket pain to become serious. This can also damage the eye, leading to ongoing pain as the eye heals or a feeling of increased eye pressure if the eye is swollen.\n9. Blepharitis\nBlepharitis can often be related to certain skin conditions or allergies, where oil glands can become clogged or infected around the edges of the eyelids leading to eye socket pain.\nBe careful of unusual manifestations from the eyes\n10. Conjunctivitis\nConjunctivitis (also known as pink eye) is a condition in which the eyes become red, itchy, swollen or infected due to a number of potential causes such as allergies or chemicals or bacterial or viral infections. Pressure behind the eyes can be a symptom of conjunctivitis.\n11. Chalazion or stye\nLocalized irritation from a lump in or around the eyelid (usually due to a blocked eyelid gland) that can cause pressure or pain to radiate from that area or can also be painful to the touch . A stye is usually more painful and sensitive, while a chalazion is usually painless.\n12. Iritis\nInflammation of the iris (or colored part of the eye) can lead to pain deep inside the eye but also feels like orbital pain. The person may also experience sensitivity to light, redness, spots in the visual field, and blurred vision.\n13. Keratitis\nKeratitis can be caused by overexposure to the sun, bacteria, or the herpes simplex virus. The main symptom of keratitis is eye or orbital pain and may also include sensitivity to light.\n14. Scleritis\nThe white part of the eye is the sclera. Anterior scleritis is the most common form, but posterior scleritis can also cause increased eye pressure or orbital pain. Pain and tenderness are more common symptoms of posterior scleritis, although the eyes are less red than anterior scleritis. It may also be associated with other conditions such as acute angle-closure glaucoma.\n15. Uveitis\nThe uvea is a part of the eye that includes the iris, the ciliary body behind the iris, and the choroid or tissue surrounding the eye. Uveitis includes a group of inflammatory diseases that cause swelling and possible destruction of eye tissues. These diseases can spread to other parts of the eye, including the retina and optic nerve.\n16. Glaucoma\nGlaucoma is a condition in which fluid accumulates in the eye, increasing pressure on the eye, leading to permanent damage to the optic nerve. Most of the time the patient will have no signs or symptoms that would allow early recognition of the disease. However, if not treated promptly, the disease can lead to serious vision impairment.\n17. Acute angle-closure glaucoma\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma is one of the most serious causes of orbital pain and increased eye pressure. Severe orbital pain that occurs suddenly and a rapid increase in intraocular pressure are signs of this disease, and symptoms such as blurred vision, headache, nausea and vomiting may also appear. If acute angle-closure glaucoma is not treated promptly, it can lead to permanent blindness.\nTherefore, patients need to go to the hospital or contact an ophthalmologist for timely examination.\n\nIs eye socket pain dangerous?\nEye socket pain occurs inside the eye, making the patient feel pain and discomfort like a stabbing or throbbing sensation. Eye socket pain is quite common and serious cases are rare. However, if eye socket pain is accompanied by visual impairment, this can be an urgent warning sign that there is an eye problem. Patients need to contact an ophthalmologist or go to the nearest hospital immediately to receive timely treatment and prevent dangerous complications that may occur. [2]\n\nSigns of dangerous eye socket pain\nIf eye socket pain occurs with the symptoms below, it is time for the patient to quickly seek medical help.\n1. Sudden, severe pain\nSudden, severe eye pain can have many different causes, from dust in the eye to glaucoma. If the patient does not receive proper treatment, it can lead to loss of vision and other serious complications.\n2. Sharp pain\nSharp eye pain can also occur with migraines or cyclical headaches. In some cases, inflammation or fluid buildup in the eye can lead to sharp pain, as well as tissue damage and vision problems. [3]\n3. Tears\nWatery eyes occur when the eyes become inflamed or irritated, such as from allergies or an eye infection. Excess tears are the body's way of trying to wash away substances that damage the eyes. Another possible cause of excessive tearing is clogged tear ducts that cause tears to pool in the eye.\nExcessive tearing is one of the signs of dangerous eye socket pain\n4. Light sensitivity\nSensitivity to light can simply be due to eye strain or dry eyes, or due to problems such as eye infection, eye injury or related to the structure of the eye.\n5. Burning in the eyes\nBurning in the eyes can be caused by blepharitis, allergies or many other eye infections or injuries. [4]\n6. Sudden loss of vision\nSudden loss of vision is a dangerous condition that requires a trip to the emergency room, because loss of vision means the problem may not be on the surface of the eye, but the damage may be inside the eye.\n7. Red eyes\nAmong the possible causes of inflammation that causes red eyes, there are other causes ranging from the most common to potentially serious that can produce changes in vision. If your eyes are not only painful but also red, this is the time to go to the emergency room immediately so that an ophthalmologist can examine you and create a specific treatment plan for each patient.\n8. Persistent headaches\nPersistent headaches can be caused by dilated blood vessels in the eye area. Inflammation of nearby nerves can cause a stabbing, throbbing pain often felt in one eye.\n9. Fever\nSore eyes and fever can be signs of a medical condition such as meningitis, pneumonia, bronchitis, diphtheria, pink eye or a cold. It is also possible to occur due to eye infections, other conditions are caused by allergies, low immunity or eye trauma.\n10. Nausea\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma causes a sudden increase in pressure inside the eye with symptoms including severe eye pain, nausea and vomiting, headaches and impaired vision. This is an emergency and requires treatment as soon as possible to prevent blindness.\n11. Droopy eyelids\nEye socket infections can lead to eye pain, difficulty moving the eyes, and drooping eyelids. When eye pain is accompanied by symptoms of drooping eyelids, it is time to seek emergency medical help.\n\nHow to diagnose eye socket pain?\nMedical evaluation of eye pain begins with a medical history and a vision health exam. The doctor will ask important questions such as: when did the pain start? Location of pain, intensity of pain, duration of pain, characteristics of pain? Or any factors that reduce pain intensity or activities the patient was engaged in at the time symptoms began. [5]\nEven history of contact lens use and previous eye injuries or surgery. Not to mention, other issues related to whether the patient is allergic to the drug or not, the type of drug currently being used, medical history, previous surgery, family history and social history (including lifestyle habits). work and travel habits as well as history of alcohol, tobacco or illegal drug use).\nProtect your eyesight with regular eye exams\n1. Check your eyesight\nA physical exam involving the eyes may first include a visual acuity test, a visual inspection of the eye and surrounding tissue, and testing of eye movements, visual field (peripheral vision), and reactions of the pupil to light.\n2. Ophthalmoscope\nAn ophthalmoscope is a special tool for observing the eye, examining the back of the eye and observing the surface of the optic nerve and blood vessels.\n3. Slit lamp\nA slit lamp is a microscope that looks at the eye's surface in detail to examine and evaluate corneal abrasions and ulcers. It can also be used to look at the anterior chamber area (between the surface of the eye and the pupil).\nOphthalmologists may also place anesthetic eye drops for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, helping to determine whether eye pain is coming from the surface of the eye or from deeper eye structures. In most cases where pain originates from the surface of the eye, the pain can be reduced with local anesthesia.\n\nHow to treat eye socket pain?\nThere are many ways to treat eye socket pain:\n1. Antibiotic eye drops\nAntibiotic eye drops can treat bacterial eye infections by killing the components of eye infections such as fungi, viruses, and bacteria. Always use antibiotic eye drops as prescribed by your doctor because they contain pharmaceutical ingredients that regular eye drops (or artificial tears) do not contain.\n2. Eye ointment\nEye ointments can treat many common eye conditions, such as conjunctivitis, dry eye syndrome, and styes. Eye infections caused by viruses, bacteria, and allergies can cause pink eye, as can exposure to chemicals, such as chlorine. Fungi, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases can cause other eye infections. Antibiotic eye ointments work by targeting and killing bacteria.\nTherefore, they are only effective in treating eye infections caused by bacteria. Eye ointment should be used as prescribed by your doctor.\n3. Remove foreign objects in the eye\nIf the object is on the eyelid, try to gently wash it off with water or eye drops. If that doesn't work, try tapping a cotton swab to remove it. If the object is on the white of the eye, gently rinse the eye with water or eye drops.\n4. Surgery\nEye surgery is used to treat a variety of conditions, including cataracts, glaucoma, retinal detachment, retinal tears, diabetic retinopathy, and nearsightedness or farsightedness.\n\nPrevent the risk of eye socket pain\n1. Wear safety glasses\nWear protective eyewear when working with hand tools, power tools, industrial chemicals or when there is a possibility of chemicals, debris or small particles entering the eyes, and when playing sports activities, such as swimming. basketball, lacrosse and tennis. Additionally, appropriate headgear should be worn, such as a hard hat for work when needed, a helmet for baseball, and a mask for hockey.\n2. Clean contact lenses\nIf a person wears contact lenses, use appropriate routine eye care to prevent contact lens-related eye injuries. Contact lens wearers should carefully follow their eye doctor's instructions for removing, applying, and cleaning contact lenses.\n3. Regular eye exams\nFrequency of eye examinations should be based on the presence of visual abnormalities and/or the likelihood of developing visual abnormalities. People with eye symptoms should be examined promptly. Asymptomatic people who are at high risk of developing eye abnormalities related to systemic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension or who have a family history of eye disease should have a comprehensive eye exam. periodic presence.\nThe frequency of these tests depends on the individual's age, specific condition, and ability to detect abnormalities on test. Asymptomatic and low-risk adults should have an initial comprehensive eye exam by an ophthalmologist, after which they should follow a routine evaluation schedule designed to detect eye disease.\nMSc. Doctor Pham Vu Huy Tung is examining and treating the disease\nSore eyes can occur for many reasons including dry eyes, infections and allergies. Some more serious causes include glaucoma, aneurysms, and cancer. K\nOphthalmology Department - Tam Anh General Hospital with a team of dedicated doctors and nurses, with a solid professional foundation and modern equipment genuine imported from European and American countries will help diagnose and diagnose. Appropriate treatment regimen helps take care of your eye health and brings peace of mind to you and your loved ones.\nPeople should consult a doctor if they experience severe or persistent eye socket pain, especially if the pain occurs along with other worrisome symptoms. The doctor will determine the cause of the pain and provide appropriate treatment to prevent dangerous complications that may occur for the patient.",

Burning in the eyes\nBurning in the eyes can be caused by blepharitis, allergies or many other eye infections or injuries. [4]\n6. Sudden loss of vision\nSudden loss of vision is a dangerous condition that requires a trip to the emergency room, because loss of vision means the problem may not be on the surface of the eye, but the damage may be inside the eye.\n7. Red eyes\nAmong the possible causes of inflammation that causes red eyes, there are other causes ranging from the most common to potentially serious that can produce changes in vision. If your eyes are not only painful but also red, this is the time to go to the emergency room immediately so that an ophthalmologist can examine you and create a specific treatment plan for each patient.\n8. Persistent headaches\nPersistent headaches can be caused by dilated blood vessels in the eye area. Inflammation of nearby nerves can cause a stabbing, throbbing pain often felt in one eye.\n9. Fever\nSore eyes and fever can be signs of a medical condition such as meningitis, pneumonia, bronchitis, diphtheria, pink eye or a cold. It is also possible to occur due to eye infections, other conditions are caused by allergies, low immunity or eye trauma.\n10. Nausea\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma causes a sudden increase in pressure inside the eye with symptoms including severe eye pain, nausea and vomiting, headaches and impaired vision. This is an emergency and requires treatment as soon as possible to prevent blindness.\n11. Droopy eyelids\nEye socket infections can lead to eye pain, difficulty moving the eyes, and drooping eyelids. When eye pain is accompanied by symptoms of drooping eyelids, it is time to seek emergency medical help."

Always use antibiotic eye drops as prescribed by your doctor because they contain pharmaceutical ingredients that regular eye drops (or artificial tears) do not contain.\n2. Eye ointment\nEye ointments can treat many common eye conditions, such as conjunctivitis, dry eye syndrome, and styes. Eye infections caused by viruses, bacteria, and allergies can cause pink eye, as can exposure to chemicals, such as chlorine. Fungi, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases can cause other eye infections. Antibiotic eye ointments work by targeting and killing bacteria.\nTherefore, they are only effective in treating eye infections caused by bacteria. Eye ointment should be used as prescribed by your doctor.\n3. Remove foreign objects in the eye\nIf the object is on the eyelid, try to gently wash it off with water or eye drops. If that doesn't work, try tapping a cotton swab to remove it. If the object is on the white of the eye, gently rinse the eye with water or eye drops.\n4.
