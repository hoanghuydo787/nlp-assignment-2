    "content": "Elbow pain: Causes, diagnosis and treatment\n\nElbow pain is a manifestation of a group of bone and joint diseases that directly affect the mobility of the arm. The disease, when not accurately diagnosed and treated promptly, can cause dangerous complications such as muscle atrophy, joint deformity, and even disability. Proactively learning information about the disease is the best way to prevent the disease.\n\nStructure of the elbow joint\nThe elbow is the part that connects the arm and forearm. The elbow has the ability to move flexibly and rotate 180° thanks to its structure including:\nExternal part (external epicondyle): This is the attachment site of the extensor muscle groups of the fingers and wrist.; The inner part (medial epicondyle): This is the attachment site of the muscle groups that flex the fingers and wrist.; Surrounding part: This is where the ligament system and joint capsule attach.\n\nWhat is elbow pain?\nElbow pain or elbow pain is a symptom of a disorder that affects the function, activity and structure of the elbow joint. The disease occurs when one or more parts that make up the elbow become inflamed or excessively irritated. Patients will have red, swollen and painful joints, with limited range of motion. In many cases, there can be joint deformity and stiffness of the elbow joint, causing difficulty in daily activities and work. (first)\n\nCauses of elbow pain\nElbow pain is caused by a number of causes including: (2)\n1. Osteoarthritis\nElbow pain often occurs in people with osteoarthritis. This is a common form of chronic arthritis, causing damage and wear and tear of joint cartilage, causing the ends of the bones in the joints to rub against each other.\nDegenerative arthritis is especially common in the elderly. In addition to stiffness and elbow pain, patients with degenerative elbow arthritis also have a number of symptoms such as:\nJoint swelling; Limited mobility; Appearance of bone spurs in the elbow on x-ray; When bending or straightening the joint, there is a clicking sound; The elbow joint is deformed\n2. Rheumatoid arthritis\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease that progresses when the immune system is overactive and dysfunctional, continuously attacking the body's healthy cells, causing them to be damaged. In healthy people, the immune system recognizes and attacks foreign allergens. For people with rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system stimulates the production of antibodies that strongly attack the lining of healthy joints, causing arthritis.\nThe disease can affect any joint in the body, including the elbow joint. Pain from rheumatoid arthritis is often symmetrical. Joints are often hot, patients may have sharp or dull pain. After a period of progression, rheumatoid nodules will form at the elbow.\n3. Gout\nGout occurs when uric acid in the body is not eliminated but accumulates in the blood. Over time, they will deposit in joints and tissues in the form of sharp crystals, causing an inflammatory reaction. The patient will have swelling and severe pain in the joints, including the elbow joint. Common symptoms of gout-related elbow arthritis include:\nHeat, redness, swelling, severe pain in the joints; The pain is more serious or starts after drinking alcohol, eating seafood, red meat, animal organs... or using drugs (Aspirin, diuretics), infections, or using chemicals to treat cancer. letters.; The pain reduces after about 5-7 days.; The skin around the joint feels hot to the touch; Fever.; Tired.; Forms tophi particles.\n4. Psoriatic arthritis\nWhen you have psoriatic arthritis, your elbow will become inflamed and severely painful. This is chronic arthritis and autoimmune arthritis. The disease often progresses in stages, occurring after psoriasis. People with elbow arthritis due to psoriatic arthritis often have permanent bone and joint damage, the joint structure is destroyed, and the parts that make up the joint are damaged. This increases the risk of disability and loss of motor function in patients. People with elbow arthritis caused by psoriatic arthritis will have symptoms such as:\nSwelling in one or both joints; Muscle pain, tendon pain; Pain and swelling of elbows and fingers; Pain and stiffness of the spine; Scalp peeling; Pitted nails; Tearing the nail away from the flesh underneath.; Red eyes.\n5. Arthritis caused by lupus erythematosus\nCases of elbow arthritis caused by lupus erythematosus are also quite common. When sick, the immune system stimulates the production of antibodies that attack tissues, including joints. The disease often affects both the joints of the hands and feet. In many cases, the disease also affects the elbow.\nPeople with lupus often have symptoms such as anemia, Raynaud's syndrome, damage to the kidneys, nervous system, pleurisy... causing joint pain, creating arthritis caused by lupus erythematosus.\n6. Bursitis\nBursitis affects the stability of the bursa's function. This is where fluid is stored that lubricates the joints and soft tissues around the joints, reducing movement friction. The characteristic manifestation of this condition is soft tissue swelling, which can be painful when pressed and moved.\n7. Other causes\nElbow pain can also occur due to objective external influences such as:\nInjury: Accidents that lead to injury are also the cause of illness. Therefore, you need to thoroughly treat injuries related to bones and joints. Delaying treatment or improper treatment can cause complications such as disproportionate development of hand bones, pseudoarthrosis, arthritis, joint infection...; Nature of work: Osteoarthritis is common in people whose work is heavy and requires frequent lifting. Inflammation at the elbow joint is often due to the patient having to continuously repeat hand activities (builders, repairmen, etc.).; Playing too much sports: Excessive sports activities and incorrect technique are one of the leading causes of joint and soft tissue pain around the joints. For example, inflammation of the tendon attachment points of the medial epicondyle, lateral epicondyle of the elbow,...\n\nSubjects at risk of disease\nFactors that can increase the risk of diseases that cause elbow pain include:\nAge: Elderly people are often at higher risk of the disease.; Gender: Most forms of arthritis often occur in women, or gout occurs more often in men; Genetic factors: People with a family history of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis... will have a higher risk of developing elbow arthritis than other groups of people.; Occupation and daily life: People who work strenuously and regularly perform repetitive movements that affect the elbow are often at higher risk of joint pain and inflammation of the tendon attachment points around the joint.; Infection: Infection can give rise to various forms of arthritis and periarticular soft tissue inflammation.\n\nHow to prevent elbow pain\nSome of the ways below can help you reduce the risk of elbow arthritis, specifically:\nBalance time between exercise, work and rest; Avoid exercise and strenuous work; Limit injuries by being careful when living and playing sports.; Warm up carefully before doing heavy work or playing sports; Avoid repetitive movements that increase pressure on the elbow.; Complete treatment of injuries; Spend 30-60 minutes a day exercising your body such as yoga, tai chi, swimming...; Healthy and balanced diet: You should make sure to fully supplement groups of substances such as vitamins, minerals, fats, starch and protein. This will help maintain strong bones and tissues, reducing the risk of elbow arthritis.\n\nWhen should I see a doctor immediately?\nPatients should see a doctor immediately when they have symptoms such as: (3)\nSevere pain appears, accompanied by bruises and redness around the elbow.; Prolonged high fever, ineffective fever-reducing measures; Unable to move arm, or pain when moving; Joints are deformed or have abnormal movements.\n\nDiagnose the cause of elbow pain\nDuring the examination, the doctor will carefully ask the patient's medical history, clinical symptoms, and actual injuries to evaluate the joint condition. In addition, the patient will be prescribed appropriate tests to diagnose the cause of elbow pain such as:\nBlood test: This test will help doctors check uric acid levels, blood sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein..., thereby distinguishing causes of arthritis such as gout, rheumatoid arthritis... In addition, , this test also helps doctors check for infections.; Check joint fluid: The doctor will use a small needle to take a sufficient amount of joint fluid from the elbow, then analyze the sample in the laboratory. Based on the results, the doctor can check for infection, the cause of arthritis, and differentiate between arthritis and related diseases.; X-ray: This diagnostic method helps find bone abnormalities such as bone tumors, bone spurs, fractures, osteoarthritis..., thereby accurately determining the disease condition.; Magnetic resonance imaging MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging helps create detailed images of cross-sections of soft tissue, thereby helping doctors determine the condition and location of damage.; CT scan: A CT scan will create detailed images from many different angles of the bones, helping doctors identify abnormalities within the structure of bones and tissues.; Joint ultrasound: When ultrasounding a joint, high-frequency sound waves will create detailed images of soft tissues such as synovium, cartilage, etc. Through this, doctors can quickly identify damage locations in the system. Osteoarthritis.\n\nTreatments\nNon-surgical treatment\nUse medicine\nThis is a commonly applied treatment method for elbow joint pain. Depending on the cause and level of damage, the doctor may prescribe medications such as Acetaminophen (mild to moderate pain), Tramadol (moderate to severe pain), local pain relievers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs), slow-acting anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biological drugs, Corticoids,... (4)\nPhysical therapy\nPhysical therapy helps reduce pain, increase elbow range of motion, and prevent stiffness. In addition, this method also helps improve blood circulation, increase strength, stretch and improve ligament flexibility. Commonly applied forms of physical therapy include:\nPractice physical therapy; Ultrasound therapy; Heat therapy; Electrotherapy\nSurgical treatment\nWhen elbow pain due to complex causes does not respond to medical treatments, doctors may prescribe surgery to improve elbow function. The technique used in surgery will depend on the type of cause, severity, age and treatment goals of the patient. Commonly used surgical methods to treat arthritis pain in the elbow include:\nArthroscopy; Open surgery; Artificial joint replacement\nIf the elbow joint is severely damaged and beyond the possibility of recovery, artificial joint replacement surgery may be considered and prescribed by the doctor. This method uses artificial joints to completely replace damaged joints. This is the final solution to help patients regain their elbow mobility in the most feasible way.\nCenter for Orthopedic Trauma, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is where a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons gather such as: TTND.Prof.Dr.Nguyen Viet Tien; Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa; Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh; MSc. Tran Anh Vu; Dr. Tran Xuan Anh, Dr. Le Dinh Khoa, Dr. Do Tien Dung; Dr. BS.CKII Vu Huu Dung... This is also one of the pioneer units in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal diseases with modern techniques according to updated international protocols.\nThe hospital is also equipped with modern machinery and imaging equipment such as: Somatom Drive 768-slice CT scanner, new generation Magnetom Amira BioMatrix magnetic resonance machine, Artis Pheno robot, densitometer. bones, ultrasound machines...; Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss surgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table... to be able to detect injuries early and effectively treat musculoskeletal diseases...\nTam Anh General Hospital also owns a spacious clinic system and high-class boarding area; modern rehabilitation area; Comprehensive post-operative care process helps patients quickly recover and stabilize their health after surgery.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Orthopedics Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nElbow pain is a relatively complex condition, it can be caused by many different causes.
