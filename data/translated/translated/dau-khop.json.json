    "content": "Joint pain: Causes, treatment and prevention\n\nJoint pain is one of the common symptoms that causes discomfort for patients, greatly affecting their quality of life. When experiencing joint pain that lasts and the level of pain increases over time, patients should go to a reputable medical facility for timely examination and treatment.\n\nWhat is joint pain?\nJoint pain is a feeling of discomfort and pain in any joint of the body. Joint pain is a common complaint in patients with musculoskeletal diseases. Joint pain has many different causes. Sometimes, joint pain is a manifestation of a systemic disease or injury. (first)\nJoint pain may affect just one joint or may affect many different joints (generalized joint pain). The location and nature of the pain will depend on the cause of the patient's illness.\n\nLocation of joint pain\nKnee joint\nPain in the knee joint is caused by diseases in the knee joint or the soft parts around the joint. The level of pain is different for each person. Some people may feel only mild pain, while others may have severe knee pain, causing difficulty in movement and daily activities.\nShoulder\nShoulder pain is one of the common conditions. It is estimated that about 20% of the population will experience shoulder pain during their lifetime. This rate is second only to lumbar spine pain.\nShoulder pain is also caused by many causes such as shoulder osteoarthritis,  bursitis, tendonitis and shoulder injury, related nerve diseases:  nerve damage or some other organ diseases such as pain angina, pneumonia, lung tumors...\nHip joint\nHip pain can be caused by hip osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, aseptic capsular necrosis, and hip synovitis. Hip pain can also occur during pregnancy or after injury...\nAnkle joint\nThe ankle or ankle joint is a very vulnerable position. Ankle joint pain can be a symptom of arthritis, enthesitis, etc. Treatment includes anti-inflammatory drugs, rest or compression depending on the cause and condition.\nWrist joint\nWrist joint pain can occur in anyone and does not discriminate by age or gender. The wrist is a part that is frequently used to perform tasks in daily life as well as play sports. This is the joint area that is easily damaged and causes pain.\nCauses of wrist pain due to incorrect posture include: Carpal tunnel syndrome, de Quervain longus tendonitis..., wrist pain due to osteoarthritis or wrist pain due to disease. Systemic inflammatory arthritis such as  rheumatoid arthritis…\nElbow joint\nElbow pain often occurs when one or more parts that make up the elbow become overly irritated, leading to painful inflammation. Typical symptoms are redness and swelling in the joints, accompanied by limited range of motion in the elbow. Many cases can cause joints to become stiff or deformed, causing difficulty in daily activities.\n\nCauses of joint pain\nThere are many causes of joint pain. Depending on the cause, the nature of the pain is different and the treatment method is also different. Most causes of joint pain are harmless. However, some joint pain requires long-term treatment because it causes long-term joint problems. (2)\nOsteoarthritis\nOne of the chronic bone and joint diseases that causes joint fatigue and pain is osteoarthritis. The disease is common in people over 40 years old, especially after 60 years old. Osteoarthritis causes weakening of the joint cartilage and intervertebral discs, accompanied by a decrease in lubricating mucus in the joints and inflammation of the joint synovium.\nThis makes movement of the joints quite difficult, causing pain and stiffness. Most joints in the body are at risk of degeneration, most commonly osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, finger, hand, lumbar spine, cervical spine, shoulder joint, and ankle joint. …\nInfection\nIf you have an infection in your joints (septic arthritis), you need to promptly see a doctor for active treatment to avoid possible dangerous complications.\nInjury\nJoint-related injuries are also one of the common causes of joint pain and joint fatigue.\nDislocation: When moving incorrectly in daily life, working or playing sports, the wrong posture can cause joint dislocation or subluxation. This injury  causes joint pain and can recur many times . If not treated promptly, dislocation can lead to damage to ligaments, joint capsules and other irreversible damage.; Fracture: Is a condition of continuous loss of bone, causing bleeding and pulling of accompanying muscles. This condition can cause bleeding in the adjacent joint and increased pain in the joint.; Ligament damage: This is also one of the common injuries that causes joint pain and aches. Partial or complete rupture of the ligament will cause limited joint movement along with varying degrees of joint pain.\nGout\nDeposition of monosodium urate crystals into tissues causes acute or chronic arthritis. Acute arthritis occurs in one joint, usually in the big toe joint. The main symptoms of an acute gout attack are swelling, heat, redness, and sudden, severe joint pain.\nGout is a disease more common in men than women. The disease begins in middle-aged men and postmenopausal women, is rare in young people and is often more severe in those who develop the disease before age 30.\nArthritis caused by autoimmune disease\nRheumatoid arthritis: Up to 70% of patients have joint pain when it is cold. Rheumatoid arthritis will cause pain and stiffness, especially in the wrists and hands. The disease causes difficulty in moving, walking and even sleeping poorly when the weather changes...; Lupus erythematosus: Is a systemic disease that can threaten the patient's life if not treated aggressively. The disease affects most organs, causing not only mild fever, hair loss, and weakness but also muscle pain and joint pain.; Fibromyalgia is a disorder caused by the brain's ability to process pain signals. Characteristics of this disease are musculoskeletal pain, joint pain, fatigue, affecting memory, mood, and sleep. => I should remove this paragraph; Ankylosing spondylitis: is a chronic disease with symptoms of pain in the spine, sacroiliac joint, hip joint... Common damage is bilateral sacroiliitis. In the late stages, the joint may be partially or completely fused. sacroiliac bilaterally; , forming a bony bridge between the vertebral bodies of the lumbar spine. In some cases, there may be pain in the knee joint, wrist joint...\nVitamin D deficiency\nVitamin D is one of the nutrients that helps absorb calcium to keep bones strong. Signs of vitamin D deficiency include common symptoms such as joint fatigue, joint pain, prolonged and recurring pain in the bones accompanied by fatigue.\nMenopausal women\nMenopausal women often have recognizable symptoms such as hot flashes, sleep disorders, urogenital syndrome, and night sweats. Especially accompanied by signs of joint fatigue and joint pain.\n\nDiagnosis of joint pain\nYour doctor will perform a physical examination and will ask you a series of questions about your joint pain. From there, potential causes can be eliminated. To identify joint damage associated with joint pain, a joint X-ray may be necessary.\nYour doctor may order blood tests to screen for autoimmune disorders if another cause is suspected. Doctors also order an erythrocyte sedimentation rate test to measure the level of inflammation in the body or a blood count. total.\n\nSubjects susceptible to joint pain\nOsteoarthritis is the most common cause of joint pain in the elderly.\nAlthough more common in younger people (30 - 40 years old), rheumatoid arthritis can also start later, appearing in people after age 60.\nPeople over 55 years old with stiff shoulders and hips, the pain of which is often worse in the morning, may have polymyalgia. Recognizing polymyalgia rheumatica is important because treating the disease can help prevent other problems.\nGout in older people tends to affect the knee joints, ankle joints, thumb joints... causing joint pain and affecting quality of life.\n\nComplications of joint pain\nIf joint pain is not properly detected and treated promptly, it will cause many dangerous complications:\nLoss of motor function\nPeople with joint pain in the early stages, if not treated properly and promptly, can easily cause complications including reduced or loss of motor functions such as grasping, grasping, etc.\nMuscle atrophy, joint deformity\nLong-term joint pain can lead to complications such as joint stiffness. The patient's hand has difficulty clenching, turning the arm or shoulder. More dangerous complications that can occur include muscle atrophy, joint adhesions, joint deformity, and even paralysis.\nCardiovascular effects\nNot only causing complications in the joints, joint pain symptoms can cause complications in other organs such as acute rheumatism. This disease causes damage to the heart's ears and heart valves, and can cause death in elderly patients. This is also a disease that increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in older people\n\nHow to treat joint pain\nJoint pain, if not treated promptly, will clearly affect quality of life. In some cases, joint pain can go away on its own. However, in some cases, joint pain may require a visit to the doctor. You should make an appointment if you don't know the cause of your joint pain and are experiencing other unexplained symptoms. (3)\nYou should see a doctor if:\nSwelling, redness, tenderness or warmth to the touch in the area around the painful joint; Pain lasts 3 days or more; Have a fever but no obvious cause.\nTake emergency precautions if any of the following occur:\nYou have just experienced a serious injury.; Joints appear deformed; Joint swelling occurs suddenly; Joints are completely immobile; You have severe joint pain.\nTreatment at home\nArthritis is one of the most common causes of joint pain. Arthritis includes osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Doctors consider OA and RA both to be chronic conditions. Currently, there is no treatment to completely eliminate joint pain related to arthritis.\nTherefore, it is necessary to see a doctor with experience in the musculoskeletal specialty for a thorough examination and timely treatment plan. The doctor will be the one to diagnose the disease and provide the best treatment for the patient.\nIn addition, patients can coordinate with doctors to make lifestyle changes such as:\nStay physically active and follow an exercise program that focuses on moderate exercise.\nWarm up well before exercising to maintain a good range of motion in your joints.; Keeping your body weight within a safe range helps reduce stress on your joints.; Patients can massage, take warm baths, stretch regularly and get enough rest in case the pain is not caused by arthritis.\nMedical treatment\nIn some cases, the doctor will need to aspirate the joint fluid to get the joint fluid tested, check for infection or other pathology to determine the cause of joint pain. The aspiration procedure also helps release inflammatory fluid from the joint socket, Reduce joint pain and the treatment effect is more obvious. Your doctor may also recommend joint replacement surgery if necessary.\nOther nonsurgical treatments may include lifestyle changes or medications that can put the disease into remission. Once the inflammation subsides, your medical treatment will focus on tightly controlling the condition to avoid recurrence.\nYou should see your doctor if you have unexplained joint pain, especially if your symptoms don't go away on their own after a few days. Early detection and diagnosis can allow for effective treatment of the underlying cause of your tired joints.\n\nHow to prevent joint pain\nJoint pain can be caused by inflammation and degeneration, meaning symptoms tend to worsen over time. For each joint pain condition, different causes will have different treatments. To prevent joint pain, note the following:\nWeight management\nThe extra weight puts pressure on the joints, especially the knees, hips and feet. The Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation of America specifically recommends losing weight if you have arthritis, are overweight, or obese. Your doctor can help you set a goal weight and design a program to help you reach it.\nLosing weight can put less strain on your joints, reduce pain, and prevent future damage to your joints.\nExercise regularly\nIf you have joint pain, exercise can help you:\nWeight management; Keeps joints flexible; Muscle flexibility is enhanced, providing more support during treatment.\nCurrent guidelines strongly recommend starting an appropriate exercise program. Working out with a trainer or another person can be especially beneficial, as it can increase motivation.\nGood options include low-impact exercises like walking, cycling, swimming, and water activities.\nUse hot and cold therapy\nHeat and cold treatments can help reduce joint pain and joint fatigue caused by inflammation.\nTake long warm showers or baths in the morning to relieve tightness, use an electric blanket or heating pad to relieve overnight discomfort.; Cold treatments can help reduce joint pain, swelling, and inflammation. Apply ice or use ice packs or ice-wrapped towels to apply to painful joints for quick pain relief. Avoid applying ice directly to the skin.; Use some topical creams or ointments to create warmth and soothe joint pain and aches.\nAcupuncture\nAcupuncture can reduce pain caused by arthritis and restore balance in the body. You should find a licensed and certified acupuncturist to feel more secure during the procedure.\nMeditate to cope with pain\nReducing stress during meditation can also help reduce inflammation and pain. Gentle exercises you can do such as yoga, tai chi... These methods combine meditation, relaxation and breathing techniques with gentle exercise.\nFollow a healthy diet\nA diet rich in fresh fruits, vegetables and whole foods can help boost your immune system and overall health.\nBoosting your antioxidants with a plant-based diet helps reduce inflammation by removing free radicals from the body. A diet that prioritizes red meat, processed foods, saturated fats, added sugar and salt can worsen inflammation, especially arthritis.\nThese foods may be good for other health conditions, including obesity, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart disease and complications.\nAlthough diseases associated with joint pain do not recommend vitamin D or fish oil supplements as a treatment method. However, foods containing these nutrients contribute to improved overall health.\nAdd turmeric to dishes\nTurmeric, a popular spice in everyday dishes. Turmeric contains a substance called curcumin, a substance with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.

However, massage is unlikely to pose risks and may provide indirect benefits, such as stress relief.\nAsk your doctor to recommend a rehabilitation specialist experienced in treating people with arthritis. You can massage yourself under the guidance of a physical therapist.\nSupplement good nutrients for joints\nAccording to scientific research, some essences such as Collagen Peptide, Undenatured Type 2, Turmeric Root, Chondroitin Sulfate... have been proven to prevent inflammation, reduce pain caused by arthritis and osteoarthritis, and regenerate joint cartilage. and effective subchondral bone. Supplementing products containing these essences is considered a superior solution to support joint and bone pain relief from the root and comprehensively.\n\nHow to care for patients with joint pain\nPeople with joint pain need to clearly understand the condition and determine the cause. Relatives need to compile data about the patient's condition to create a reasonable care plan. The care plan should consider the patient's condition, find priority issues and note:\nLet the patient rest, lie in a comfortable position, avoid positions that affect the joints and cause increased joint pain.; Instruct patients to exercise their joints to limit complications; Help patients have a healthy, nutritious diet, eat lots of green vegetables and fruits; Periodic medical examination and testing as prescribed by the doctor; Help patients take and inject medication as prescribed by the doctor.\nCenter for Orthopedic Trauma, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is where a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons gather such as: TTND.Prof.Dr.Nguyen Viet Tien; Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa; Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh; MSc.
