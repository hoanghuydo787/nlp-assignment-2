The article below will provide more information about the causes, symptoms and common diseases caused by eye pain.\n\nWhat is eye pain?\nEye pain occurs when the eye area feels sore, uncomfortable, or throbbing in one or both eyes. Pain in many locations near the eye, inside the eye or behind the eye [1]... The above phenomena are called eye pain. Some people have eye pain when exposed to strong light or looking at a computer screen for a long time. Eye pain is a symptom of a number of diseases that need to be checked and treated early.\nHave your eyes examined regularly if your eyes show signs of abnormalities.\n\nWhat parts of the eye can be painful?\nAny part of the eye can be painful depending on the cause. Parts of the eye that are often susceptible to pain include [2]:\nEyelids: complex structure including: skin, subcutaneous tissue, orbicularis oculi muscle, eyelid cartilage... plays a role in helping to cover and protect the front of the eye. The eyelids have oil-secreting glands that help lubricate and moisten the eyes.; Conjunctiva: mucous membrane that covers the eye from the edge of the cornea to the back of the eyelids. The conjunctiva protects the eye surface from external influences, helping the eyeball move and the eyelids move easily without causing rubbing.; Sclera: thick and hard membrane that surrounds the shape of the eyeball.; Cornea: transparent, spherical-shaped membrane in front of the eyeball. The cornea has the role of protecting the eyeball and controlling the focus of light entering the eye.; Eye socket: pyramidal bone socket, made up of skull and facial bones.\nEye pain is a common sign of many different eye diseases.\n\nCommon causes of eye pain\nEye pain has many causes and can also be a symptom of many different diseases. Some common causes of eye pain [3]:\nInfection: bacteria, viruses from hands or air fly into the eyes causing infection. Eye infections can also be spread from neighboring areas such as the nose and sinuses. Infection causes inflammation, pain, soreness, and eye discomfort; Contact lenses: wearing contact lenses that are contaminated with dirt, wearing them for too long, or lenses that do not fit will cause eye pain.; Allergies: eyes are allergic to elements such as pollen, dust, animal hair causing irritation, itching, and even pain; Toxins: eye irritation due to exposure to toxins such as cigarette smoke, air pollutants, chlorine in swimming pools, toxic chemicals that cause eye damage and pain.; Inflammation: immune system reaction causing swelling, redness, sensitivity to light, eye pain; Glaucoma: occurs when the fluid in the eye does not drain properly, causing pressure on the eye, causing eye pain.\n\nSymptom\nEye pain is often alone or accompanied by other symptoms. Each accompanying symptom signals different eye conditions [4].\nDry, sore eyes: Sore eyes combined with a dry, scratchy feeling can be caused by dry eye syndrome. Eyes are constantly dry and painful, even producing tears because the eyes react to dryness and irritation by tearing.; Itchy, red, sore eyes: allergies and eye infections both make the eyes feel sore, red, and itchy. Eyes are often itchy, uncomfortable, and can hurt after rubbing too much. Conjunctivitis due to eye infection is a particularly common cause of eye pain and redness. Contact lens irritation also causes eye pain and redness.; Severe eye pain: eye injury causes sharp pain in the eye. Severe eye pain can sometimes be a sign of a headache or migraine. In dangerous cases, throbbing eye pain can be a symptom of a serious condition such as a brain tumor or aneurysm. If you have sudden eye pain combined with blurred vision, light sensitivity, nausea, or vomiting, it may be a symptom of acute angle-closure glaucoma. You need to go to a medical facility immediately for timely examination and treatment.; Sore eyes: dull, aching eye pain or pain deep inside the eye, possibly due to eye fatigue. However, if the pain does not subside, it signals serious eye conditions.; Eye pain, feeling of a foreign object in the eye: maybe you have something stuck in your eye causing discomfort and pain. At this time, you should not rub your eyes, rubbing too much can cause corneal scratches. Stay calm and follow these tips: blink quickly to pop and release the foreign object, rinse eyes with clean water.\nDanger signs: if eye pain is combined with the following symptoms, it warns that your eyes are in danger and need to be treated immediately:\nVomit.; Sensitivity to light.; Blurred vision.; Convex eyeball; Cannot move eyes.\nEye pain can occur at all ages.\n\nEye pain is common\nBelow are common eye diseases that cause eye pain [5]:\nCellulitis: acute infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue with symptoms such as swelling, heat, redness and pain. Damage can quickly spread, so early treatment is needed to avoid dangerous complications.; Conjunctivitis (pink eye): inflammation and infection of the conjunctiva and eyelids caused by a virus. Conjunctivitis causes red eyes, itching, discomfort, and eye pain; Corneal damage: due to scratches, tears, ulcers or keratitis. When the cornea is damaged, the patient feels a lump inside the eye, difficulty opening the eye, congestion, sensitivity to light, blurred vision and burning pain in the eye.; Dry eyes: commonly occurs in office workers who have to sit in front of a computer screen, in cold, dry weather. Dry eyes cause fatigue, redness, and eye pain; Glaucoma: angle-closure glaucoma  causes severe pain, nausea and blurred vision due to a sudden, rapid increase in eye pressure.; Optic neuritis: a condition in which the nerves in the eye become inflamed or irritated. The disease occurs at all ages but is more common in women between 20 and 40 years old. Optic neuritis often occurs in one eye, causing blurred vision, difficulty seeing at night, pain, and increased pain when moving the eye.; Uveitis: a general term used to refer to a group of diseases that cause eye redness, eye pain and inflammation. The disease affects the uvea, the middle layer of the eye, or other parts.

To choose the right treatment method, the first thing to do is find the cause of eye pain. Below are common treatments for sore eyes [7]:\nDue to infection:\nAntibiotic, antifungal, or antiviral eye drops; Analgesic.; Anti-allergic drugs.; Artificial tears make eyes more comfortable.\nFor more effective treatment, patients can use clean tissues to clean their eyes regularly, keep their hands and feet clean, do not rub their eyes, avoid using contact lenses, and do not wear eye makeup until the disease heals.\nDue to eye injury\nIf unfortunately an eye injury occurs, the patient needs to stay calm and follow these steps:\nAsk relatives, friends, and acquaintances to take you to the nearest medical facility for timely rescue.; Gently place a clean shield over the eye until you reach the hospital.; If chemicals splash into your eyes, rinse them with clean water.; Do not attempt to remove foreign objects stuck in the eye.; Do not rub or apply pressure to your eyes.; If your eyes are bleeding, be careful when taking the anti-inflammatory medication aspirin, as it can thin the blood, making it more difficult to stop the bleeding.\nEye pain is a sign of many eye diseases.
