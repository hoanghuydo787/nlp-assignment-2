How can this disease be treated? Please refer to the information in the following article.\n\nSymptoms of left side migraine\nSome statistics show that more than 50% of adults worldwide have headaches. The pain can spread throughout the head or just in one location, such as a left migraine or a right migraine.\nWhen having a left-sided migraine, the patient will feel pain spreading throughout the first half of the head, a mild dull pain or sharp pain in a certain position on the left side of the head, severe pain, sharp pain.\nAlong with left-sided migraine symptoms, there are many other signs such as drooping eyelids, blurred vision, watery eyes, impaired vision, neck and shoulder tension, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, etc. Migraines The left head can also make the patient more sensitive to light, sound, scents, etc.\nIn particular, depending on the cause of the headache, you may notice that the pain gets worse in the evening or at some time during the day, such as when you first wake up.\nLeft-sided migraine can be accompanied by other symptoms such as dizziness, vertigo, nausea, etc.\n\nCauses of left side migraine\nWhy do many people have left-sided migraines?

Accordingly, left migraine can come from many different causes, such as: (1)\nLifestyle factors\nDue to diet: Frequently skipping meals, irregular diet, drinking a lot of alcohol and alcoholic foods are risk factors that contribute to migraines, including left-sided migraines. Skipping meals causes the brain to lack glucose to maintain activity, increasing the risk of migraines. Wine and alcoholic drinks contain ethanol - a cause of headaches; Stress: Tension headaches are an extremely common condition and many people suffer from this condition.; Lack of sleep: People who have little sleep, often have light, restless sleep or often stay up late are also more susceptible to migraines or left-sided migraines.\nPeople who are often stressed have a higher risk of left or right migraines\nNeurological factors\nLike right-sided migraines, left-sided migraines can originate from neurological factors. Specifically, having neurological diseases such as giant cell arteritis, trigeminal neuralgia, occipital neuralgia, migraine headaches, etc. will make you susceptible to headache attacks accompanied by other symptoms. Other symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, impaired vision, etc.\nDue to injury\nPeople with head injuries due to falls or collisions, whether bleeding or not, are also at risk of migraines, for example left-sided migraines. This may be due to blood or fluid collection under the skull. Normally, after an injury, about 30% of cases have headaches.\nIf you feel a left or right migraine after an injury, the headache becomes increasingly severe and is accompanied by other unusual symptoms such as shaking limbs, weakness in the limbs, being unable to speak clearly, and insomnia. ,... then you should go to the hospital for examination as soon as possible. It may be a sign that there is a blood clot/fluid in the brain.\nDrug abuse\nA little-known fact is that headache medications can lead to more headaches if overused. Left-sided migraines due to drug abuse often occur when you wake up in the morning.\nMedications that can make headaches worse if arbitrarily abused include: Aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil), naproxen (Naprosyn), sumatriptan (Imitrex), zolmitriptan (Zomig), ergotamine derivatives, oxycodone (Oxycontin), tramadol (Ultram) and hydrocodone (Vicodin),…\nMedication abuse can cause left or right migraine headaches to become more severe and prolonged\nInfections and allergies\nFrequent left-sided migraines are a symptom of a respiratory infection (occurs when you have a cold, flu, etc.).

When a hormone level suddenly increases, such as during menstruation or pregnancy in women, it can also \"trigger\" a migraine to occur.\nPregnant women are more likely to have left or right migraines due to hormonal changes\nOther causes\nIn addition to the common causes mentioned above, some other causes can also increase the risk of migraines or left-sided migraines including: (2)\nFrequently wearing hats that are too tight: Wearing helmets or other types of hats that are too tight can often put pressure on the head, causing pain all over the head or half of the head.; Due to glaucoma: Glaucoma is caused by increased intraocular pressure, damaging the optic nerves, leading to symptoms such as eye pain, blurred vision, severe headaches, etc.; High blood pressure: Migraines on the left side can stem from dangerously high blood pressure.; Stroke: A stroke, a blood clot blocking blood vessels to the brain, or bleeding inside the brain causing a stroke can all lead to left or right migraines.; Tumors in the brain: Tumors or unusual foreign objects in the brain can cause extremely intense and sudden migraines, accompanied by other symptoms such as confusion, difficulty walking, slurred speech, and tremors. terrible,…; Blue light: Using electronic devices for long periods of time, exposure to excessive blue light also stimulates your headaches.\n\nWhat is left side migraine?\nSymptoms of left migraine can be a warning sign of diseases that the patient should not ignore, such as:\nMigraine headaches; Cerebrovascular malformations; Meningitis; Encephalitis; Glaucoma; Cold; Flu; Giant cell arteritis; Cluster headaches; Sinusitis; …\n\nWho is susceptible to left-sided migraines?\nAnyone can get a left-sided migraine. However, people who are often stressed, under pressure at work or in life, have anxiety disorders, depression, etc. will be more susceptible to headaches.\nIn addition, people with unscientific living habits, getting little rest, not getting enough sleep, drinking a lot of alcoholic beverages, eating salty foods, often skipping meals, etc. are also at higher risk of migraines.\nWomen are also more susceptible to migraines or left-sided migraines than men due to hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle, during pregnancy, during premenopause, etc.\nSee more:\nWhat is frontal migraine?

Brain images from an MRI scan will be more detailed than a CT scan. Through MRI results, it is possible to diagnose bleeding in the brain, tumors, infections, etc.\nIn addition, to diagnose and evaluate the disease, doctors can also check the patient's body temperature, check for fluid or pus in the nostrils, check for swelling in the pharynx, and see if the eye area is red.
