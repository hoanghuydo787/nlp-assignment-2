    "content": "Right testicular pain: Causes, symptoms and prevention\n\nRight testicular pain is not common but can warn of many dangerous health problems if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Therefore, as soon as they notice unusual symptoms, men should proactively contact their doctor for early monitoring, to minimize serious complications later.\n\nWhat is right testicular pain?\nRight testicular pain is a pain that occurs only in the right testicle and has absolutely no symptoms on the opposite side. This phenomenon is not common but can be a warning sign of some serious medical problems that need to be monitored and treated early.\n\nCauses of right testicular pain in men\nRight testicular pain comes from many different groups of causes. Some typical factors to mention include: (1)\n1. Varicocele\nThis is a condition in which the diameter of the spermatic vein inside the right scrotum increases in size, dilates larger than normal (normal diameter of the spermatic veins is < 2mm), causing pain. The main cause comes from the problem of blood stasis, which reduces sperm count and is directly related to the common phenomenon of infertility.\nIn fact, a right varicocele is not too common, often a sign of abnormal venous anatomy, a hernia in the groin or a tumor. Therefore, as soon as men notice suspicious symptoms, they should immediately contact their doctor for timely diagnosis.\n2. Testicular torsion\nTesticular torsion is an emergency that requires immediate medical intervention. This condition occurs when the spermatic cord (including the vas deferens and blood vessels) becomes twisted, blocking blood circulation to the scrotum. If the right testicle is twisted, men will feel sudden, severe pain, swelling, even vomiting and increased urination frequency. Torsion can cause tissue death, leading to orchiectomy if not treated promptly within 6 hours.\n3. Trauma\nInjury to the right testicle can initially cause severe pain and then gradually turn to dull pain. If the pain persists or the scrotum begins to swell, men should contact their doctor immediately to avoid testicular torsion or rupture.\n4. Hematoma\nRight testicular pain can occur after injury or surgery due to hematoma in the scrotum. This condition usually disappears without treatment but has the potential to form calcifications of various sizes. Therefore, for peace of mind, men should immediately contact their doctor from the beginning to limit unwanted problems.\n5. Epididymitis and orchitis\nEpididymitis is a common cause of scrotal pain in adult men. When swollen, it will lead to pain in the entire right testicle. If this condition is not treated early, it can lead to orchitis, affect fertility, and have a high risk of requiring surgical intervention.\n6. Hydrocele\nRight testicular pain can also be caused by hydrocele. This is a phenomenon of fluid accumulation around the right testicle, which is not cancerous but over time will cause pain, heaviness or discomfort. If the condition progresses seriously and the amount of fluid surrounding the testicles is high, the patient will be considered for surgical intervention to remove all the fluid and suture the testicular membrane to avoid recurrence.\n7. Testicular cancer\nInitially, testicular cancer does not cause pain, but if not treated promptly, this symptom will appear. In this case, doctors often prescribe surgery to completely remove the organ.\n\nSymptoms of right testicular pain\nRight testicular pain is more likely to occur just before and during sexual activity, especially after ejaculation. Many cases also appear during or after exercise. Men may experience pain when awake, sleeping, standing, sitting or moving. Some common symptoms include: (2)\nSudden, severe pain in the right testicle; Dull pain, spreading to the lower abdomen; Swelling, redness, pain in the scrotum and testicles; The testicles are located in an abnormal position or higher than normal in the scrotum.\n\nHow dangerous is right testicle pain?\nMost cases of right testicular pain can be treated successfully. However, if the pain is caused by infection, testicular torsion, etc., without timely medical intervention, there is a risk of permanent damage to the organ. This can seriously affect fertility, even cause necrosis, spreading throughout the body and threatening life. (3)\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nMen should immediately contact their doctor if the following signs appear: (4)\nSelf-discovered abnormal mass in the scrotum; The scrotum turns red and feels tight and warm to the touch; Contact with someone who has mumps.\nAdditionally, below are some very serious symptoms that require emergency medical attention:\nSudden pain in the scrotum, becoming increasingly severe, with no signs of improvement; Nausea or vomiting; Pain appears due to injury.\n\nDiagnosis of right testicular pain in men\nFor right testicular pain, the doctor will examine the patient in standing and lying positions, with a number of questions related to pain level, pain duration, pain location... Men also have Can answer questions related to medical history, surgery, sexual habits... to support accurate diagnosis. (5)\nIn addition, any activities that make the pain worse or better, such as exercising, having sex, sitting, going to the toilet, etc. should be shared in detail. After that, some tests that may be ordered include:\nBlood test, urine test: These two tests are conducted to rule out the cause of infection.; Doppler ultrasound: Ultrasound is indicated to examine and detect varicocele, testicular torsion, hypoechoic foci in abscesses, testicular trauma, epididymal cysts, fluid around testicles, and masses. Tumors in the testicles (if any),…\n\nHow to treat right testicle pain\nYour doctor will prescribe treatment for right testicular pain based on the causative factors as well as the severity of the condition being experienced. Some commonly applied methods include:\n1. Treatment at home\nHome treatments are used in cases where testicular pain comes from an obvious cause, such as an injury. Some commonly specified options are:\nRest: Men suffering from testicular pain should not lift heavy objects or exercise excessively; Apply ice: Applying cold compresses can help reduce swelling and pain. Do this regularly several times a day, for no more than 15 minutes at a time to achieve positive results.; Apply heat or take a warm bath to soothe the pain.\n2. Medicine\nOver-the-counter pain relievers (Acetaminophen), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).; Prescription medications: Prescription medications may be prescribed to treat the underlying cause such as an infection.\n3. Surgery\nSome conditions that cause right testicular pain that require surgery include:\nTesticular torsion.; Severe varicocele or no improvement with medical treatment; Membrane effusion; Crushed tissue due to testicular trauma; Orchitis and epididymitis abscess (with pus); Testicular cancer.\nIn some cases, orchiectomy is necessary to remove tumors and damaged tissue. However, patients need to discuss carefully with the doctor to clearly understand the risks and complications that may occur during the procedure, thereby preparing themselves psychologically and with an appropriate care plan.\n\nHow to prevent right testicular pain in men?\nSome causes of testicular pain cannot be completely prevented. However, below are some useful solutions that men can apply to minimize the possibility of pain: (6)\nUse condoms during intercourse to avoid sexually transmitted diseases.; Use protective gear when participating in sports activities to prevent injuries.; Mumps vaccination to reduce the incidence of viral orchitis; Regular health check-ups to early detect varicocele and hydrocele (if any).\nCenter for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology - Urology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts, Internal Medicine and Surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
