    "content": "Left testicular pain: Causes, symptoms and prevention\n\nLeft testicular pain comes from many different groups of causes. It is a rare problem but poses a serious threat to health if not treated early. Therefore, when noticing unusual symptoms, men need to immediately contact their doctor for timely monitoring and diagnosis.\n\nWhat is left testicular pain?\nLeft testicle pain is a painful condition that only occurs in the left testicle and is completely normal on the opposite side. This phenomenon is often rare but can still be a warning sign of some serious problems that need to be detected and treated early. (first)\n\nCauses of left testicular pain\nLeft testicle pain comes from many different causes, typically as follows:\n1. Varicocele\nArteries throughout the body carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to bones, tissues and organs. Meanwhile, veins function to carry oxygen-depleted blood back to the heart and lungs. The condition of varicocele forming a vascular bundle that nourishes the left testicle is more common than on the right due to congenital or acquired anatomical abnormalities.\nThis leads to left testicular pain with symptoms of dull pain and discomfort, directly affecting daily activities.\n2. Orchitis\nThis is a condition in which the testicles become inflamed due to a bacterial or viral infection. The pain usually starts in the left testicle and can then spread throughout the scrotum. In addition, the scrotum is also at risk of swelling, gradually turning red and becoming firmer than normal.\nIn most cases, the mumps virus is the leading cause. Infections are often transmitted sexually, gonorrhea, urinary tract infections...\n3. Epithelial cyst\nThis is a fluid-filled sac that forms in the peritoneal duct surrounding the neurovascular bundle (also known as the spermatic cord) from the upper part of the testicle. Abnormal symptoms will not appear if the cyst is still small. When it grows to a larger size, the patient will feel pain and heaviness at this location.\n4. Testicular torsion\nThis is considered an emergency that requires immediate medical intervention. This condition occurs when the spermatic cord becomes twisted in the testicle, cutting off the blood supply to the organ. Within 6 hours, if the patient does not receive timely treatment, there is a risk of having to have the testicles removed. Specifically, the common symptoms are sudden pain and swelling.\n5. Hydrocele\nInside the scrotum is a thin layer of tissue that surrounds the testicles. If fluid or blood fills this shell, it will lead to hydrocele. At this time, the scrotum may swell with or without pain. This is also one of the main causes of left testicular pain, which often occurs in newborns and tends to go away on its own within a year or so. In boys or adult men, this phenomenon often occurs due to inflammation or injury.\n6. Trauma\nThe testicles are easily injured during sports, collisions or accidents. In addition, because the left testicle hangs in a lower position than the right, the risk of damage is also higher. Although minor injuries only result in temporary pain that subsides over time, serious cases require prompt care to avoid danger.\n7. Testicular cancer\nThis is a condition in which malignant tumors form in the testicles, with the risk of metastasizing to other parts of the body. Currently, the main cause has not been accurately determined. Cancer is often discovered during a routine health check-up. Typical symptoms are the appearance of a tumor, swelling in the scrotum, and pain that appears and gradually increases over time.\n\nSymptoms of left testicular pain\nLeft testicle pain can recover quickly or leave permanent damage and even loss of fertility if not treated promptly. Some easily recognizable symptoms include: (2)\nSudden, severe pain in the left testicle; Dull pain from the left testicle, spreading to the lower abdomen; Swelling, redness and pain in the scrotum and left testicle; The left testicle is in an abnormal position.\nIn addition, some accompanying symptoms may be experienced, including:\nAbnormal discharge from the penis; Burning when urinating; Change in frequency of urination; Appearance of blood in urine.; Cloudy urine.; A feeling of itching and irritation appears inside the penis; Fever and chills.; Vomiting, nausea.; Tired body.\n\nHow dangerous is left testicle pain?\nThe danger of left testicular pain depends on each cause, specifically as follows: (3)\nNot serious: Signs of pain and mild swelling appear after performing an action and are completely not accompanied by any other symptoms. Or mild but dull pain throughout the day, increasing when walking and doing heavy work and decreasing when lying down is common in varicocele disease.; Moderate severity: Testicular pain accompanied by a burning sensation when urinating may be a sign of a urinary tract infection or sexually transmitted disease.; Very serious: Symptoms of severe, sudden pain in the left testicle require immediate treatment.\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nLeft testicular pain associated with dangerous conditions such as testicular torsion requires immediate medical attention. Below are some serious symptoms that men should note so they can contact their doctor early: (4)\nThe pain appears suddenly and intensely; Inability to locate both testicles.; Symptoms of pain or swelling appear one hour after the injury.; Pain accompanied by nausea or vomiting; Pain and fever.; The scrotum is painful, red, and feels warm; Feeling unusual lumps, lumps or worm-like tufts in the scrotum; Having difficulty urinating, feeling the need to urinate but not being able to urinate.; Presence of blood or abnormal waste in the urine.; Pain symptoms become more and more severe.\n\nDiagnosis of left testicular pain\nFor left testicular pain, the doctor will initially conduct a physical examination and ask some questions related to symptoms, severity, location of pain, medical history... Then, a Several diagnostic methods can be prescribed to ensure the most accurate conclusions, including: (5)\nDoppler ultrasound of the scrotum, testicles and epididymis; Cases of suspected testicular cancer require micro-computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to clearly determine the tumor structure and images of metastases, if any.; Testicular biopsy determines the nature of the testicular tumor; Blood count test.; Urine test.; Culture testicular fluid and urethral fluid to look for bacteria and do antibiograms.\n\nHow to treat left testicle pain\nDepending on the cause, the doctor will prescribe appropriate treatment for left testicle pain. Specifically as follows: (6)\nPain due to varicocele: Left testicular pain due to varicocele often requires early treatment to avoid affecting future fertility. In particular, surgery is always the preferred method, helping to improve painful symptoms and restore normal function of the testicles. Cases of recurrence after surgery do not exceed 10%.; Orchitis: Treatment options for orchitis depend on the underlying cause. If the infection is caused by bacteria, your doctor may prescribe treatment with antibiotics. In the case of viral inflammation, such as mumps, the condition will usually improve on its own over time if the clinical condition is mild. If it is more serious, the testicles and parotid salivary glands will swell and become very inflamed. Hospitalization may be required for intensive monitoring and treatment.; Epithelial cyst: If left testicular pain comes from this cause, surgery to remove the cyst will be performed. However, the procedure has the risk of affecting fertility, so in many cases, men should wait until after giving birth before proceeding.; Testicular torsion: This case requires surgical treatment as soon as possible to untwist the testicular stem, restore blood supply to the testicles and fix the testicles with sutures to the inner wall of the scrotum to avoid recurrence. after.; Hydrocele: Surgery is often indicated, after which the doctor will drain the fluid or blood around the testicles, then suture the testicular membrane to avoid recurrence.; Injury: The doctor will base on the severity of the injury to prescribe pain medication or surgical intervention.; Testicular cancer: Depending on the progression of the cancer, the doctor may prescribe surgery, radiation therapy or chemotherapy.\n\nHow to prevent left testicular pain?\nLeft testicular pain cannot be absolutely prevented, but the risk can be reduced by preventing the underlying causative factors. Specifically as follows: (7)\nCheck your testicles regularly, preferably once a month, to detect early signs of abnormalities, including tumors; Always wear protective gear when playing sports, working... to avoid injury to the testicles.; Prevent urinary tract infections by emptying the bladder completely each time you urinate.; Always keep the genital area clean, including the testicles, and change underwear regularly to avoid unwanted diseases.; Have safe sex, use condoms during intercourse.\nCenter for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology - Urology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts, Internal Medicine and Surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
