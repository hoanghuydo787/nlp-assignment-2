    "content": "Testicular pain: 12 causes, symptoms, and prevention\n\nTesticular pain comes from many different causes, and can be a warning sign of some serious health problems. Therefore, as soon as unusual symptoms are detected, patients should contact their doctor as soon as possible for monitoring, diagnosis and appropriate treatment.\n\nWhat is testicular pain?\nTesticular pain is a painful condition that occurs in one or both testicles, and can begin suddenly or last longer depending on the case. This problem often affects men of all ages. (first)\nSpecifically, testicles are small, egg-shaped sex organs located inside a thin bag of skin (scrotum). The main function is to produce sperm and androgen hormones, mainly testosterone. Testosterone release is controlled by anterior pituitary luteinizing hormone. Meanwhile, sperm production will be controlled by anterior pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone and gonadal testosterone.\nWhen testicles have sharp pain, the pain can be acute (appears suddenly and does not last long) or chronic (gradual and lasts). Most cases stem from sudden injuries, causing severe pain because this location contains many sensitive nerves.\nHowever, pain can also originate from other factors, even not entirely from the testicles but from another part of the body such as the inguinal scrotum, scrotal area, kidneys, and ureters. This type is called transitional pain.\n\nCauses of testicular pain\nBesides the obvious cause of injury or accident, testicular pain can also stem from the following factors: (2)\n1. Orchitis\nOrchitis appears with swelling, heat, redness, and pain in one or both testicles and may be due to a bacterial or viral infection. In children, mumps virus is also one of the leading causative factors. In this case, signs of swelling usually begin to appear 4-6 days after the onset of mumps.\n2. Inguinal hernia (groin)\nAn inguinal hernia occurs when part of the intestine or omentum is pushed through a weak part of the abdominal wall muscle into the scrotum. This condition is usually not dangerous but causes pain and discomfort. Some cases may require emergency surgery such as strangulated inguinal hernia\n3. Epididymitis\nThe epididymis is a group of thin, curled tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the vas deferens and out of the body. When inflammation occurs, men will feel pain, the scrotum will be swollen, hot to the touch, and the epididymis will become large and hard. Symptoms of epididymitis usually last a few days to a few weeks, and in chronic cases it will last more than 6 weeks.\n4. Epididymal cyst\nThis is a fluid-filled space that can form inside the epididymis near the testicles. These cysts are not cancerous and are usually painless, but sometimes they grow large, causing discomfort to the patient.\n5. Hydrocele\nThis condition is very common and occurs when fluid accumulates around the testicles, sometimes causing pain and infection.\n6. Hematoma\nThis condition occurs when blood surrounds the testicles, usually as a result of trauma.\n7. Varicocele\nThis is a condition in which a group of large veins appear abnormally near the testicles. This causes a dull feeling of discomfort, greatly hindering daily activities. The pain often tends to subside when lying down. In many cases, varicocele also affects fertility, most of which must be treated with surgery.\n8. Testicular torsion\nTesticular torsion is a twisting of the blood supply to the testicle, leading to severe pain. This condition can occur at any time, requiring immediate surgery to avoid the risk of testicular necrosis.\n9. Kidney stones\nKidney stones occur more commonly when the body is dehydrated. At this time, the stone can get stuck in the ureter (the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder), causing back pain and pain spreading to the external genitals or pelvis. Depending on the size, the stone will pass out on its own or require surgical intervention.\n10. Post-vasectomy pain syndrome\nMen after a vasectomy will sometimes feel testicular pain. This pain often comes from increased pressure in the vas deferens or epididymis.\n11. Urinary tract infection\nBacteria that enter the urinary tract, including the urethra, bladder, and kidneys, can lead to genital tract infections. One of the common symptoms of this condition is testicular pain accompanied by painful urination, hematuria, and hematuria. Infections may go away on their own or require antibiotics depending on the severity.\n12. Testicular cancer\nTesticular cancer appears most commonly in men between the ages of 15 and 35. Sometimes, the symptoms encountered are a dull pain in the scrotum, groin, testicles, testicular swelling, pain in the lower abdomen, etc. In this case, the doctor will prescribe additional in-depth tests such as diagnostic imaging and cell tests to come to the most accurate conclusion.\n\nTesticular pain is a warning sign of what disease?\nTesticular pain that is not caused by an accident or injury can be a warning sign of many serious diseases, including: (3)\nOrchitis.; Kidney stones; Inguinal hernia.; Epididymitis.; Spermatogenic cyst.; Membrane effusion.; Hematoma.; Varicocele.; Testicular torsion.; Testicular cancer.; Chlamydia.\nIf the condition is not detected and treated early, it can lead to many dangerous complications. In particular, men with Chlamydia or testicular torsion are at risk of facing the following serious problems:\nPermanent damage.; Affects fertility; The infection spreads throughout the body, which can cause death.\n\nSymptoms of testicular pain\nTesticular pain can be easily recognized with some typical symptoms as follows: (4)\nPain: The level of pain will vary depending on the cause. A sudden injury often causes sharp, then dull pain. Meanwhile, pain from epididymitis will become worse over time. Kidney stones often cause sharp pain in the back, gradually spreading to the testicles and head of the penis.; Bruising: Signs of bruising may appear on the scrotum if the testicles are injured.; Nausea and vomiting: These are symptoms of many conditions, including testicular trauma, kidney stones or orchitis.; Swelling: The scrotum may appear lumpy, shiny and red. This is often a sign of trauma, orchitis, epididymitis or testicular tumor.; Fever: Testicular pain with fever is a sign of orchitis or epididymitis.; Urinary problems: Some types of kidney stones can cause frequent urination, burning during urination, or blood in the urine.\n\nRisk factors increase the risk of disease\nBoys and men of all ages can experience testicular pain. Among them, the risk group is people who do heavy work or regularly play sports that require full contact. (5)\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nMen should contact their doctor for immediate medical attention if the following symptoms appear: (6)\nSudden, severe pain in the testicles; Testicular pain accompanied by symptoms of nausea, fever, chills or blood in the urine.; Testicular pain is mild but lasts more than a few days.; Tumors or signs of swelling appear around the testicles or scrotum\nIn particular, sudden, severe testicular pain can be a sign of testicular torsion. This condition requires immediate medical treatment to avoid permanent damage and total organ amputation.\n\nDiagnosis of testicular pain\nFor men with testicular pain, the doctor will initially ask them to stand up and lie down to check. After that, the patient needs to answer a number of questions about when the pain started, how long it lasted, pain level, pain location, sexual history, surgery... to help draw accurate conclusions. best. In addition, men also need to tell their doctor about any activities that make the pain worse, such as going to the bathroom, exercising, sitting or having sex.\nNext, the patient may be subjected to some of the following diagnostic methods:\nBlood or urine test: This test helps rule out testicular pain due to infection.; Ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging: If the doctor detects a tumor in the testicles.\n\nMethods of treating testicular pain\nDepending on the severity, your doctor will prescribe appropriate testicular pain treatment. As follows:\n1. Treatment at home\nApply ice to the painful area; Place a rolled towel under the scrotum while lying down.; Take a warm bath.\n2. Use medicine\nIf home treatments are not effective, men may be prescribed medication, including:\nPain relievers: Acetaminophen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), including Aspirin, Ibuprofen, and Naproxen, can help relieve pain. These are often prescribed in cases where the pain appears due to injury or inflammation of the testicles.; Antibiotics or anti-infective drugs: These drugs are often prescribed for pain caused by orchitis and epididymitis.; Tricyclic antidepressants, such as Amitriptyline can be used to treat testicular pain caused by nerve damage.\n3. Surgery\nTesticular pain usually does not require surgery, except in emergencies such as testicular torsion or testicular cancer. As follows:\nSurgery for testicular torsion: The doctor will untwist the spermatic cord and restore blood flow to the testicles. The next step is to sew stitches around the testicle to avoid repeat damage, including on the opposite side.; Hernia repair surgery: This procedure is performed if the hernia cannot be pushed back into the abdomen or reduced in size.; Epididymectomy: Surgeons may remove the epididymis if signs of chronic pain do not respond to medication.; Reattaching the vas deferens: This method is indicated in cases where men have testicular pain due to vasectomy. However, this treatment option is rarely performed, and if it is, it is usually performed as outpatient surgery.; Shock wave lithotripsy: This is a minimally invasive procedure that uses shock waves to break up kidney stones.; MDSC method: This operation is performed through anesthesia. Specifically, the surgeon will use a surgical microscope to dissect and cut the nerves passing through the spermatic cord, aiming to cure or relieve testicular pain.; Orchiectomy: This is a last resort but rarely occurs, only performed in cases where the pain cannot be effectively treated with medication or less invasive procedures.\nAfter any surgery, it is important to provide proper and thorough wound care to prevent infection. For this issue, men should discuss carefully with their doctor for detailed instructions. In addition, patients also need to have regular check-ups to be monitored and checked regularly to avoid unwanted problems that may occur.\n\nMeasures to prevent testicular pain\nNot all cases of testicular pain can be prevented. However, making healthy lifestyle changes can prevent some of the underlying causes of injury. (7)\nAs follows:\nAlways wear protective sports gear to avoid injury to the testicles.; Have safe sex, especially using condoms during intercourse.; Check the testicles once a month to detect early abnormal changes or the appearance of tumors.; Always empty your bladder completely when urinating to prevent urinary tract infections.; Contact your doctor for a timely examination as soon as symptoms of pain in the testicles appear.; Build a daily menu with foods that are good for testicular health, including: bell peppers, carrots, sweet potatoes, sardines, shrimp, garlic, onions...\nCenter for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology - Urology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts, Internal Medicine and Surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
