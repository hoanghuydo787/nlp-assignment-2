    "content": "Breast pain: Causes, symptoms, care and prevention\n\nBreast pain makes women worry and easily think in a negative direction, affecting both physically and mentally. So, is this situation really something to worry about and how should it be handled to have a healthy bust?\n\nWhat is breast pain?\nBreast pain is a condition of pain around the breast, causing discomfort and anxiety for women. According to research published in the US National Library of Medicine, 70% of women experience breast pain at any time in their lives [1]. Pain can be cyclical or non-cyclical, specifically:\nCase 1: Occurs a few days each month, about 2-3 days before menstruation. The pain ranges from normal to mild to moderate and affects both breasts.; Case 2: Occurs a week or so each month, starting before menstruation and sometimes continuing throughout the menstrual cycle. The pain is moderate or severe and affects both breasts.; Case 3: Happens throughout the month and is not related to the menstrual cycle.\nEach person can feel breast pain in different states, such as: sharp pain, burning pain or soreness with tightness in the breast tissue. However, most breast pain usually originates in the breast or chest wall.\n\nBreast pain is a sign of what disease?\nWhen having breast pain, the first thing women think of is breast cancer (breast cancer). About 80-90% of breast pain cases are not pathological. Meanwhile, in cases where there is no pain, no changes appear on the chest, but dangerous breast tumors or tumors have formed. Therefore, to know exactly what disease breast pain is a sign of, women should go to the hospital for a thorough examination and diagnosis.\nBreast pain is mostly a benign change but can also be a sign of breast cancer\n\n8 common causes of breast pain (chest pain).\nWomen have chest pain and breast pain for many different reasons, which need to be clearly identified to have appropriate remedies. Women can refer to the common causes of breast pain below:\n1. Hormonal changes\nThis type of breast pain occurs due to changes in the hormones that control the menstrual cycle. These hormonal changes can cause pain in both breasts in the few days before menstruation. Because the pain can come and go with the menstrual cycle, it is called cyclical breast pain.\n2. Chest trauma\nBreast pain can originate from the chest wall, chest muscles or due to problems with nerves in the thoracic spine such as pulled muscles, inflammation around the ribs, chest wall trauma (being hit in the chest), broken bones... causing colds. Severe swelling, bruising, a large mass in the breast, redness and warmth in one breast (may be a sign of infection), angina, sprain or back injury.\n3. Wearing an inappropriate bra\nIf the bra size and style are not suitable, it can cause the ligaments connecting the breasts to the chest wall to stretch too much, causing discomfort and pain in the breasts. The pain may increase with vigorous activity or while you exercise. Bras that are too tight not only cause chest pain but also cause difficulty breathing, back pain, headaches, and shoulder pain.\n4. Breast inflammation and infection while breastfeeding\nDuring the breastfeeding period, many women often experience breast pain with a number of symptoms such as:\nNipples are sore because the baby is not latching properly.; Tingling feeling when breastfeeding; Sore nipples due to biting or dry, cracked skin or nipple infection; Breastfeeding women are more likely to develop breast infections (mastitis) with symptoms such as swelling, heat, redness, and pain.\nIf you have pain while breastfeeding, you should talk to your doctor or counselor. Your doctor can help you correct the problem and maintain your baby's milk supply. In case of breast infection, it is necessary to see a specialist. Treatment usually includes antibiotics and pain relievers, sometimes requiring aspiration of pus from the abscess or surgery if more severe.\n5. Side effects of drugs\nThe cause of breast pain also includes side effects of medication. Some medications that can cause breast pain that women need to be aware of include:\nOxymethone, used to treat some forms of anemia; Chlorpromazine, used to treat mental health conditions; Diuretics are used to treat kidney disease, heart disease, and high blood pressure.; Hormone therapy (birth control pills, hormone replacement, or infertility treatment).; Digitalis is indicated in the treatment of patients with heart failure.; Methyldopa is used to treat high blood pressure.\n6. Place the breast implant in the breast\nSome women may experience complications when placing breast implants (silicone or saline), leading to severe breast pain. One of the most common causes of pain after breast augmentation surgery is capsular contracture, when scar tissue forms too tightly around the breast implant. Chest pain can also be a sign that one of your breast implants has ruptured.\nWomen may experience breast pain after breast implants are placed\n7. Breast cysts\nBreast pain can be caused by various types of breast tumors, including benign breast tumors such as fibroids, breast cysts, milk cysts, lipomas, phyllodes tumors... or breast cancer. In this case, a thorough examination is needed to accurately diagnose the nature of the tumor, whether it is benign or malignant.\n8. Signs of breast cancer\nInflammatory breast cancer often causes pain but is rare, accounting for 1% to 5% of breast cancer cases. Symptoms of this serious disease often appear suddenly and progress rapidly. Inflammatory breast cancer can cause the mammary gland to swell, very similar to a breast abscess, with early-stage symptoms such as: nipples retracting or changing shape, pain anywhere on the breast, unusual discharge. usually on the nipple, sunken breast skin, lumps or lumps in the breast...\n\nFactors that increase the risk of breast pain\nIn addition to the 8 causes mentioned above, the risk of breast pain may increase with the influence of the following factors:\n1. Breast surgery\nBreast pain related to breast surgery may persist after the incision has healed. Breast surgery here does not just stop at placing breast implants but any type of breast surgery, including: breast augmentation surgery, breast reduction or breast reconstruction... Scar tissue pain may come and go, Even long after surgery, women still have breast pain.\n2. Fatty acid imbalance\nAn imbalance of fatty acids in cells can affect the sensitivity of breast tissue, thereby increasing breast pain.\n3. Using too much caffeine\nSome people find their breast pain improves when they reduce or eliminate caffeine. This means that consuming too much caffeine is considered a factor that increases the risk of breast pain.\n\nCharacteristics of different types of breast pain (chest pain) should be noted\nBreast pain may be cyclical or non-cyclical. Cyclic pain means the pain follows a specific pattern. Meanwhile, non-cyclical pain is pain that does not follow any pattern. People can distinguish these two types of breast pain through the following specific characteristics and symptoms of breast pain:\n1. Cyclical breast pain\nRelated to menstrual cycle and changes in hormone levels.; Dull pain accompanied by a feeling of heaviness, breast swelling/tightness or lumpiness; Usually affects both breasts; The pain appears mainly in the upper breast and can spread to the armpit.; Pain levels increase in the two weeks before the start of the menstrual cycle, then gradually decrease.; People in their 20s and 30s as well as those in their 40s can experience cyclical breast pain.\n2. Non-cyclical breast pain\nNot related to menstrual cycle.; Single attacks occur continuously or intermittently and are accompanied by a feeling of tightness or burning; Usually affects one breast; The pain is most felt within or below the breast and may also spread further throughout the breast.; Non-cyclical breast pain is common in women after menopause.\n\nWhen do you need to see a doctor for breast pain?\nThe risk of breast cancer in people with symptoms of breast pain is very low, but if breast pain progresses in the following direction, women need to see a specialist for a thorough examination:\nBreasts are sore every day for a few weeks.; The pain occurs in a specific area of ​​the breast.; Pain levels tend to become more severe over time.; Affects daily activities; Severe breast pain disrupts sleep.\nWhen breast pain affects daily activities, women need to see a doctor early\nAlthough breast pain does not pose a potentially dangerous disease, if prolonged it will negatively impact mental and physical health, thereby reducing quality of life. Therefore, women should go to the hospital to check and screen for breast diseases as soon as possible to ensure their health and mental peace of mind.\nThings you should do when preparing to see the doctor\nIf you have new breast pain, persistent pain that only affects a specific part of the breast, or affects your quality of life such as work, sleep, activities, etc., see your doctor for an evaluation. In some cases, when you call to make an appointment, you may be referred immediately to a breast specialist.\nPrepare for an appointment: The initial evaluation of your breast pain focuses on your medical history. Your doctor will ask about the location of your breast pain, its relationship to your menstrual cycle, and other relevant aspects of your medical history that may explain the cause of your pain. To prepare for this discussion:\nKeep a diary, recording when you have breast pain and other symptoms, to determine whether your pain is cyclical or non-cyclical.; Record all of your symptoms, even if they seem unrelated to your breast pain.; Rate your pain on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being no pain and 10 being the worst possible unbearable pain.; Review important personal information, including major stresses or recent life changes.; List all medications, vitamins, and supplements you regularly take.; List questions to ask your doctor, from most important to least important.\nWith breast pain, basic questions to ask your doctor include:\nWhat is the most likely cause of my symptoms?; What types of tests may I need?; What treatment do you recommend for my condition?; Are there any home remedies I can try?\nWhat to expect from your doctor. Your doctor may ask you questions such as:\nWhere do you feel pain in your breast?; How long have you had breast pain?; On a scale of 10, how severe is your pain?; Do you have pain in one or both breasts?; What pattern does the pain follow?; Have you ever had a mammogram? When was your last time?; Do you have any other signs or symptoms, such as a breast lump, thickened area, or nipple discharge?; Have you noticed any changes in your breast or nipple skin such as redness or rash?; Have you had a baby recently? Or have you experienced a miscarriage or termination of pregnancy?; How does pain affect your quality of life, such as sleep, sexual activity, or work? Does your pain keep you from performing daily activities?; Have you recently participated in any activities or had an injury to your breasts that could contribute to breast pain?\n\nMethods of diagnosing breast pain\nTests to evaluate your breast pain may include:\nClinical breast exam: your doctor will check for changes in your breasts, and check the breasts and lymph nodes in your lower neck and armpits. Your doctor will likely examine your heart and lungs, and examine your chest and abdomen to determine whether the pain may be related to another medical condition. If your medical history and breast exam and physical exam show no abnormalities, you may not need further testing, if you have had good routine breast cancer screening.; Mammogram (mammogram): if your doctor feels there is a lump in your breast or unusual thickening or finds a concentrated area of ​​tenderness in your breast tissue, you will need an X-ray -mammogram to evaluate areas of concern found during a breast exam (diagnostic mammogram), especially if you are of breast cancer screening age.; Bilateral mammogram: an ultrasound test uses sound waves to create images of your breasts, and it's often done along with a mammogram. You may need an ultrasound to evaluate the area of ​​focal pain even if the mammogram appears normal.; Breast biopsy: suspicious lumps in the breast, areas of thickening, or abnormal areas seen during an imaging test may require a biopsy before your doctor can make a diagnosis. During a biopsy, your doctor will take a small sample of breast tissue from the area suspected of being abnormal and send it for cell analysis or pathology in a laboratory.\nIn summary, the first thing a doctor does to evaluate a patient with breast pain is to examine whether the patient has any breast disease or not and find the cause of breast pain. In women 40 years of age and older, your doctor will perform an evaluation similar to a breast cancer screening. Depending on each person's risk, there are different ways to evaluate according to cancer screening principles, but the most important thing is to clearly advise patients to understand and reduce anxiety!\nYour doctor also evaluates your personal breast cancer risk, based on factors such as age, family medical history, and history of precancerous breast lesions.\n\nHow to treat breast pain?\nFor most breast pain patients, breast pain resolves on its own over time. You may not need any treatment.\nIf you need help controlling your pain or if you need treatment, your doctor may recommend:\nEliminate possible underlying causes of breast pain or factors that increase the severity of breast pain. This may include a simple adjustment, such as wearing a bra with extra support.; Use topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). You may need to use NSAIDs when the pain is severe. Your doctor may recommend that you apply NSAID cream directly to the area where you feel pain.; Adjust birth control pills. If you take birth control pills, skipping a pill-free week or switching birth control methods may help reduce breast pain symptoms. But don't try this without your doctor's advice.; Reduce the dose of postmenopausal hormone therapy. You may consider reducing your dose of postmenopausal hormone therapy or stopping it altogether.; Drink medicine with order. Danazol is the only prescription drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat fibrocystic breasts. However, danazol carries a risk of serious side effects, such as heart and liver problems, as well as weight gain and voice changes.; Tamoxifen, a prescription medication to treat and prevent breast cancer, can be helpful but it also has the potential to cause side effects that can be more unpleasant than the breast pain itself. Your doctor will consider and evaluate the need for medication based on many factors, discuss with you the pros and cons of the medication, choose the appropriate method for your breast pain condition, and only use the medication when it is absolutely necessary. the need.\nAlternative breast pain medications:\nVitamins and dietary supplements may reduce breast pain symptoms and severity for some people. Ask your doctor if either of these might help you and ask about dosage and any possible side effects:; Evening primrose essential oil. This supplement may change the balance of fatty acids in your cells, which may reduce breast pain.; Vitamin E. Early studies show beneficial effects of vitamin E on breast pain in premenstrual women, whose breast pain fluctuates during the menstrual cycle. In one study, 200 international units (IU) of vitamin E taken twice daily for two months improved symptoms in women with cyclical breast pain. There were no additional benefits after four months. For adults over 18 years old, pregnant people, and women who are breastfeeding, the maximum dose of vitamin E is 1,000 milligrams per day (or 1,500 IU).; If you take supplements for breast pain, stop taking them if you don't notice an improvement in your breast pain after a few months. Try only one supplement at a time so you can clearly determine which one helps relieve pain or not.\n\nHow to prevent and improve breast pain\nPeople can reduce the risk of breast pain and improve the severity of breast pain through scientific measures advised by a doctor, including:\n1. Avoid hormone therapy\nReduce dose or stop taking estrogen-containing medications (after consulting with specialists). Women can ask their doctor about whether switching birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy can help reduce breast pain.\n2. Avoid medications that irritate the breasts\nPain relievers such as acetaminophen or stronger pain relievers such as ibuprofen can be used, but you should consult your doctor about dosage, because long-term use may increase the risk of liver disease and other side effects.\nConsider using an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, Panadol, etc.) or ibuprofen (Advil, Mobic, etc.) but ask your doctor about how much to take, as long-term use can cause increased risk of liver problems and other side effects.\n3. Wear a bra that fits well\nWear a fitted bra with steel underwire during the day and a soft, supportive bra at night. When exercising, you should wear a specialized sports bra to ensure the best elasticity and support.\n4. Change your diet\nLimit or eliminate caffeine, and build a diet low in fat, reduce salt and increase complex carbohydrates.\n5. Regularly examine and screen for breast disease\nWomen should have regular check-ups to rule out diseases in the mammary gland, especially when there are signs of breast pain or tumors in the breast, so they should have a follow-up plan in the breast cancer screening program recommended by the doctor. All women over 40 years old should be screened for breast disease once a year. Younger people can get screened every 2-3 years.\nParticularly for people at high risk such as: Having relatives or family members with breast cancer or ovarian cancer; there are signs of abnormalities in the mammary gland; People who have early menstruation, late menopause, have not given birth, are not breastfeeding, have had irradiation in the chest area, are obese, abuse hormonal drugs, drink too much alcohol... should be examined and screened every 6 months. 1 times.\nBreast pain is mostly benign, but can also be a warning sign of mammary gland disease, which should be closely monitored. Ideally, when women notice unusual breast pain of unknown cause, they should immediately go to a reputable hospital for examination, screening, and maximum health protection.",

If your medical history and breast exam and physical exam show no abnormalities, you may not need further testing, if you have had good routine breast cancer screening.; Mammogram (mammogram): if your doctor feels there is a lump in your breast or unusual thickening or finds a concentrated area of ​​tenderness in your breast tissue, you will need an X-ray -mammogram to evaluate areas of concern found during a breast exam (diagnostic mammogram), especially if you are of breast cancer screening age.; Bilateral mammogram: an ultrasound test uses sound waves to create images of your breasts, and it's often done along with a mammogram. You may need an ultrasound to evaluate the area of ​​focal pain even if the mammogram appears normal.; Breast biopsy: suspicious lumps in the breast, areas of thickening, or abnormal areas seen during an imaging test may require a biopsy before your doctor can make a diagnosis. During a biopsy, your doctor will take a small sample of breast tissue from the area suspected of being abnormal and send it for cell analysis or pathology in a laboratory.\nIn summary, the first thing a doctor does to evaluate a patient with breast pain is to examine whether the patient has any breast disease or not and find the cause of breast pain.
