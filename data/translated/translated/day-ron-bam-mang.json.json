    "content": "Umbilical cord membrane adhesion: Causes, signs, diagnosis, treatment\n\nAlthough membranous umbilical cord adhesion is relatively rare, only about 1% of singleton pregnancies and about 9% of twin pregnancies, it is extremely dangerous, with the risk of causing adverse pregnancy outcomes such as premature birth and death. perinatal, emergency cesarean section with vasa previa. Therefore, pregnant women diagnosed with umbilical cord adhesion need to be closely monitored throughout pregnancy to minimize negative effects on the health and life of both the pregnant woman and the fetus. The umbilical cord is an important part, responsible for transporting oxygen and nutrients from mother to fetus throughout pregnancy. This is the connection between the fetus and the placenta. When the fetus is born, the doctor will cut the umbilical cord, the part of the umbilical cord attached to the placenta along with the detached part of the placenta will be taken out.\n\nWhat is a membranous umbilical cord?\nVelamentous Cord Insertion is a phenomenon in which the umbilical cord attaches to the edge of the placenta or amniotic membrane, instead of sticking to the middle of the placenta. This causes the fetus's blood vessels to operate on their own without the protection of the placenta when connected at the umbilical cord. (first)\nDoctor Duong Viet Bac, Doctor at the Center for Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tam Anh General Hospital in Hanoi, said that in obstetrics, umbilical cord adhesion to the amniotic membrane is a rare but extremely dangerous phenomenon for both pregnant women and fetuses. . This condition interferes with receiving oxygen and absorbing nutrients to nourish the fetus, or in other words, the umbilical cord clings to membranes, causing the fetus to only absorb a maximum of 30% of nutrients. This is the cause of fetal malnutrition, premature birth and stillbirth at any time.\nIn addition, the disease is extremely dangerous during labor because uterine contractions can tear the amniotic membrane, break the placenta, cut off the blood supply that nourishes the fetus, causing the fetus to suffocate, causing sudden loss of fetal heart rate and died in the mother's womb.\nIn addition, abnormal umbilical cord attachment positions such as membranous cord adhesion and marginal cord attachment also increase the risk of obstetric complications such as placenta previa, placental abruption, preeclampsia... Umbilical cord in position near the cervix, called the vasa previa, will cause serious consequences to the fetus, threatening the life of the fetus or newborn.\n\nCause of umbilical cord adhesion\nDoctor Viet Bac said that at present, the cause of the umbilical cord sticking to the membrane has not been determined. However, researchers have found some risk factors. (2)\nStatistics show that this condition occurs in about 1% of singleton pregnancies, but up to 9% of twin pregnancies. This rate will be even higher when twins share the same chorion.\nThe phenomenon of the umbilical cord clinging to the placenta and amniotic membrane is more common in pregnant women with twins, especially twins sharing the same chorion.\nOther risk factors include:\nPregnancy at an older age;; Having placenta previa or vasa previa during pregnancy;; Having gestational diabetes during pregnancy;; Smoking habits before and during pregnancy;; Cases of in vitro fertilization.\n\nIs it dangerous to have membranes attached to the umbilical cord?\nAlthough quite rare, when the umbilical cord becomes attached to the membrane, it can cause many dangerous complications. Specifically: (3)\nFor pregnant women\nCompression or rupture of umbilical cord blood vessels: The umbilical cord's membrane can cause the umbilical cord blood vessels to be unprotected, with a very high risk of compression or rupture, especially when located near the cervix.; Caesarean section: Pregnant women whose amniotic membrane is stuck to the umbilical cord during labor are forced to have an emergency cesarean section to get the fetus out.; Hemorrhage during labor: Having a membrane attached to the umbilical cord can be accompanied by bleeding during labor.\nFor the fetus\nNot only does this condition severely affect pregnant women, this condition can cause many complications in the fetus, such as:\nWhen the umbilical cord is attached to the membrane, the fetus can only absorb a maximum of 30% of nutrients, so there is a high risk of fetal malnutrition;; Increased risk of premature birth;; Low Apgar index, newborns need special care;; In case a pregnant woman is pregnant with twins, both fetuses are at risk of growth restriction.\nThe fetus may be born prematurely and need special care when born\n\nCan the umbilical cord membrane be prevented?\nDoctor Viet Bac said that currently there are no preventive measures because the exact cause of this condition cannot be determined. To minimize the risk, pregnant women need to follow the regular prenatal check-up schedule to get a fetal ultrasound to detect the condition early, if any.\nIn case a fetal ultrasound detects that the fetus has a membranous umbilical cord, the pregnant woman needs to closely and strictly follow the doctor's pregnancy monitoring and management schedule. The schedule for examination and fetal monitoring can be more dense to help the doctor closely monitor the condition of the fetus and ensure there are no abnormalities in the placenta.\nSee more: Abnormalities in the placenta during pregnancy\n\nHow is the umbilical cord membrane detected?\nDetecting umbilical cord adhesion early will help doctors proactively plan to monitor pregnancy and provide appropriate treatment, effectively handling emergency situations.\nDoctor Viet Bac said that the disease can be detected on ultrasound images of the placenta and umbilical cord in the second trimester (the second 3 months of pregnancy). When entering the third trimester (last 3 months of pregnancy), this condition is more difficult to detect. Ideally, pregnant women should have regular prenatal checkups because the risk of placental cord rupture can occur at any time when the pregnant woman has her first uterine contractions.\nColor Doppler ultrasound helps accurately detect this condition up to 99%\nAbnormal symptoms during pregnancy are also contributing factors to diagnosis. If a pregnant woman has vaginal bleeding, or the fetus has a slow heart rate, the doctor may prescribe an additional ultrasound to detect abnormal umbilical cord conditions.\nTam Anh General Hospital System's Obstetrics and Gynecology Center is equipped with a modern machinery system, including a color Doppler ultrasound system that helps detect membrane-bound umbilical cords with an accuracy of up to 99%.\n\nHow to treat umbilical cord membrane adhesion?\nThe best way to detect umbilical cord adhesion is to have regular ultrasounds and closely monitor the health status, movement and heart rate of the fetus. When a pregnant woman shows signs of labor starting with uterine contractions, the doctor will prescribe an emergency cesarean section. The reason is because at this time the placenta can break, risking bleeding in the amniotic chamber, if treatment is delayed it can be dangerous to the life of the fetus. (4)\nThis is a rare phenomenon, especially the membranous umbilical cord with vasa previa rarely has symptoms and is only detected through ultrasound. Therefore, to detect this condition requires a doctor with high expertise, experience and clinical acumen.\nObstetrics and Gynecology Center of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of highly specialized, experienced, and highly skilled doctors; owns a modern machinery system, especially 2D, 3D, 4D ultrasound systems, Doppler color ultrasound, the latest generation Voluson E10 ultrasound...; Apply modern regimens in the treatment and management of obstetric complications from simple to complex.\nIn particular, the Center for Obstetrics and Gynecology of Tam Anh General Hospital System deploys comprehensive maternity service packages, on-demand maternity packages... including full health care services for pregnant women during pregnancy and when they are pregnant. Childbirth and postpartum, full range of necessary tests and ultrasounds to early detect abnormal problems, protect healthy pregnancy, safe birth, and healthy mother and baby.\nTo schedule a consultation and examination appointment with Obstetrics experts at Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nIn summary, membranous umbilical cord is a rare but extremely dangerous obstetric complication. Regular prenatal checkups and ultrasounds are ways to help detect this condition early. Therefore, it is recommended that pregnant women strictly follow the regular prenatal check-up schedule and go to the hospital as soon as they have unusual symptoms for timely and effective treatment!",
