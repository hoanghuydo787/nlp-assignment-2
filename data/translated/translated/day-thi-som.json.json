    "content": "Precocious puberty: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment\n\nThe rate of early puberty in children ranges from 1/5,000 to 1/10,000. Early puberty is one of the reasons why children have low self-esteem about their appearance and increases the risk of sexual abuse in children.\n\nWhat is precocious puberty?\nPrecocious puberty is a condition in which a child's body begins to show signs of maturity too early, including rapid growth of bones and muscles, changes in the size and shape of the body, and development of fertility. fertility, breast changes, appearance of pubic hair, voice changes, etc.\nChildren are called precocious puberty when this process occurs before age 8 in girls and before age 9 in boys. This disorder usually occurs quickly and will stop growing when the child reaches full genetic height potential. The risk of early puberty in girls is 10 times higher than in boys. This risk will increase when the child is obese. (first)\n\nCauses of early puberty\nAccording to research, children reach puberty when the brain begins to produce a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). This hormone goes to the pituitary gland to help stimulate the production of estrogen hormone (hormone involved in growth and development of sexual characteristics in women) and testosterone hormone (hormone responsible for growth and development). sexual characteristics in men).\nPrecocious puberty in children can be caused by many other causes such as tumors on the ovaries, adrenal glands, pituitary gland, brain or central nervous system problems, hormone disorders, trauma. brain, family medical history or due to some rare genetics. Even in many cases of early puberty, no specific cause can be found.\nEarly puberty makes children feel self-conscious.\n1. Central precocious puberty\nCentral precocious puberty is a condition in which puberty begins too early, however, the steps in the puberty process do not appear to be abnormal, nor do the child have any underlying medical problems. Therefore, in most cases of central precocious puberty, the exact cause cannot be determined. In some cases, children with this disease may be concerned with the following problems:\nCentral nervous system (brain, spinal cord) tumor.; Brain or spinal cord exposed to radiation.; Brain or spinal cord damage; Hereditary McCune-Albright syndrome affects bone development, skin color and hormones.; Defects appear during birth: hydrocephalus, benign lung tumor (hamartoma),...; Children with hypothyroidism – The thyroid gland cannot produce enough hormones needed for the body.; Children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia – Genetic disorder related to hormone production in the adrenal glands.\n2. Peripheral precocious puberty\nPeripheral precocious puberty is a less common condition of precocious puberty that is not related to the hormone GnRH. The cause of early puberty in children comes from the release of estrogen or testosterone in the body due to problems occurring in the child's ovaries, testicles, adrenal glands or pituitary gland. Some problems that can cause peripheral precocious puberty include:\nChildren have tumors in the adrenal or pituitary glands that cause secretion of estrogen or testosterone; Children with McCune-Albright syndrome cause abnormal skin and bone development and hormonal disorders; Children are often exposed to products that stimulate estrogen or testosterone such as creams, ointments, etc.\nBesides, peripheral precocious puberty in women can be related to problems such as ovarian cysts and ovarian tumors. On the other hand, peripheral precocious puberty in men can be caused by a tumor in the cells that produce sperm (germ cells) or in the cells that produce testosterone (Leydig cells) or by a disorder Genetics that occur in children born in families with independent sex with gonadotropins cause the body to produce testosterone early (from 1-4 years old).\n\nSymptoms of early puberty\nBelow are some common symptoms when children have early puberty:\nBreast development in girls;; Time of first menstruation;; Testicles and penis develop;; Facial hair and beard begin to grow;; Deep, broken voice;; Growth of pubic and armpit hair;; The body grows quickly;; Acne appears;; Starting to have body odor.\n\nWhat effects does early puberty have?\n1. Height restrictions\nEarly puberty causes children to grow taller faster than their age, so parents should monitor their children's height growth.\nWhen children reach puberty early, their height will grow rapidly, higher than the height according to their age. However, when this puberty process ends, this height growth will stop. That is, children who go through puberty early will end it early, and their growth and bone development process will also end sooner. Finally, as adults, children with precocious puberty will often be shorter than children with puberty at the right age.\n2. Impact on psychology\nChildren's psychology during puberty is very easily influenced, children are easily stressed and have low self-esteem in front of their peers. In particular, changes in bust size and early menstruation can be problems that cause discomfort and annoyance in children under 9 years old.\nFurthermore, early puberty can be the cause of emotional and behavioral changes in children. Children easily become irritable and angry, and may begin to be curious and have sexual needs that are not appropriate for their age.\nEarly puberty causes children to grow taller faster than their age, so parents should monitor their children's height growth.\n\nDiagnosis of precocious puberty\nIn addition to signs of changes in the body, children with precocious puberty will often be prescribed a number of medical procedures by the doctor to accurately diagnose this condition such as:\nStomach supersonic;; Uterine ultrasound;; Ovarian ultrasound;; Endocrine blood test;; Thyroid test;; Magnetic resonance imaging MRI;; X-ray of the bones of the hand.\n\nTreatment of premature puberty\nDetecting and treating premature puberty in children will help prevent bone growth and maturation, minimize the consequences of premature puberty, and even reverse premature sexual development in children. young.\n1. Help your child understand more about his or her body\nPuberty is a period when children are quite sensitive and easily embarrassed, not daring to confide about changes in their body with others. This is an important stage that parents should accompany and share with their children, helping them understand that this is a completely normal phenomenon if these signs do not come too early. When a child reaches puberty early, parents should also inform the child about treatment so that the child lives according to his or her age.\nAccording to experts, parents are the best companions to help children better understand their bodies, confide and share even the smallest things. Therefore, parents should regularly praise their children's achievements, be tolerant and gently explain their children's mistakes, and avoid discussing and commenting on their children's appearance.\n2. Go with your child to see a doctor for timely treatment\nDepending on the cause and each specific case, the doctor will develop a suitable treatment regimen for each child, minimizing serious effects on the child's appearance and psychology. Currently, children with precocious puberty will usually be treated in one of the following two ways:\nFinding and treating the underlying cause or medical condition causing precocious puberty;; Adjust sex hormone levels with medication to prevent body growth due to early puberty.\n\nHow to prevent early puberty\nPrecocious puberty can occur for many different reasons, even in many cases the cause is unknown. However, parents can reduce the risk of early puberty for their children by having them take the following preventive measures:\nFollow a balanced diet to avoid overweight and obesity in children, especially girls; Give children regular health check-ups as recommended by the Ministry of Health; Do not let your child use premature beauty cosmetics or drugs that affect the child's sex hormones.\nNote, currently some people believe that early puberty in children is related to giving children a lot of milk every day, so many parents have cut off their children's milk supply. There is currently no scientific evidence on this issue. Interrupting the supply of supplementary milk for children causes calcium deficiency, affecting the child's resistance and height.\nFor more information about child care and other health issues, you can contact the Department of Pediatrics, Tam Anh General Hospital at:\nEarly puberty can cause many psychological and physical barriers in children. Therefore, parents should pay attention to observing their children's development, and at the same time, regularly confide in and educate their children about issues during puberty. This will help children prepare psychologically and be more open, from which they can detect and treat diseases early.",
