    "content": "Foreign bodies in the eye: Causes, signs and dangerous complications\n\nEye trauma is a common emergency in ophthalmology. This condition occurs 3-4 times more often in men than in women [1]. A foreign object in the eye is also considered an eye injury. If not treated properly, it will leave sequelae and reduce vision. The article below will specifically answer information about foreign objects in the eye: Causes, signs and dangerous complications.\n\nWhat is a foreign body in the eye?\nForeign bodies in the eye are the phenomenon of foreign objects falling into the eye, which can be dust, sand, insects or small objects in daily life, affecting the cornea or conjunctiva of the eye.\nThe cornea is the outer, transparent layer at the front of the eye and is also the most vulnerable part of the eye area.; The conjunctiva is a thin layer that covers the inside of the eyelids and the white part of the eye. Therefore, when a foreign object falls into the eye, it can lodge in the cornea, conjunctiva, or even penetrate the eyeball.\nDepending on the level of damage caused by foreign objects, there is appropriate treatment. Rubbing your eyes will not remove the foreign object but can cause serious eye damage such as corneal tears, infection, corneal damage, impaired vision, etc.\n\nCauses of foreign objects falling into the eyes\nForeign objects falling into the eye can arise in many different situations.\nUnder the influence of the natural environment such as: wind blowing dust and sand into the eyes.; Foreign objects thrown into the eye such as: wood, metal, glass, cement or other small debris...\n\nCommon types of foreign bodies in the eye\nCommon foreign objects in the eye are eyelashes, eye rust, sawdust, dust, sand, cosmetics... Sometimes they are small insects in nature or pieces of metal and glass that often occur due to accidents while working. work with certain tools and materials. Contact lenses are eye support tools, but they can also accidentally become foreign objects when they slip into the eye.\n\nWarning signs of foreign objects in the eye\nTo recognize a foreign object in your eye, you need to pay attention to the following signs [2]:\nSharp pain in the eyes.; Burning and irritation.; Feeling of something in the eye; Tearing and red eyes; Blinking continuously.; Discomfort when blinking; Blurred vision or loss of vision in the eyes; Sensitive to light.; Bleeding into the white of the eye (conjunctival hemorrhage).\nIn case of continuous eye pain or changes in vision, you should contact an Ophthalmologist immediately for first aid and proper treatment to avoid serious eye damage.\nIf a foreign object falls into your eye, go to a medical facility immediately to remove the foreign object.\n\nDangerous complications if foreign objects are not treated\nMost cases of foreign objects in the eye are mild and can heal on their own within a few days or weeks with proper care. For example, simple foreign objects such as sand or dust often only cause irritation, redness, and tearing. In this case, just wash away the foreign object with clean water and apply medication as prescribed by your doctor to prevent infection.\nHowever, in many cases where the eye is seriously damaged by a foreign object, you need to go to the hospital early for the procedure to avoid more serious illness.\nSome complications caused by foreign objects in the eye include:\nInfection and scarring: some foreign objects of plant origin can easily cause fungal ulcers on the cornea. At that time, you will waste time on treatment, often leaving complications of corneal scarring, causing vision loss.; Corneal scratches: Foreign objects can scratch the cornea, the clear membrane at the front of the eye. In some cases, a scratched cornea can easily become infected, causing serious corneal ulcers. If you know how to care for it, a corneal scratch will heal in 2 days. If left for a long time, they can lead to recurrent corneal erosion. This is a condition in which the outermost epithelial layer of the cornea is not attached to the eye, causing the patient to feel severe pain and a scratchy feeling in the eye.; Ulcers, abscesses: foreign objects causing damage to the cornea can lead to complications such as corneal ulcers and corneal perforation if not treated promptly and properly. Localized infections of the cornea can affect vision or lead to abscesses.; Damage to the eyeball: In case of a large foreign object entering the eye, it can cause injury and rupture of the eyeball. If not treated early, it will lead to blindness.; Corneal scarring: failure to treat early will cause complications of corneal scarring. This can cause some degree of permanent vision impairment.\nWarning signs of foreign objects in the eye\n\nTreatment of foreign bodies in the eye\n1. Remove foreign objects in your eyes at home\nIf you suspect or feel there is a foreign object in your eye, it is important to go to the Ophthalmology department for timely treatment to avoid infection and vision loss [3].\nIn case of simple foreign objects such as dust particles, sand or small debris:\nBlink quickly: when dust, hair or another small object falls into the eye, the body's natural reflex is to blink. Blinking quickly can help clear debris and allow tears to wash away the foreign object. The more you blink and get the tears flowing, the better your chances of removing the foreign object. Blink by opening and closing your eyes quickly. If you can't concentrate to make tears flow, try yawning to make tears.; Pull the upper eyelid and place it on the lower eyelid: if you want to remove a foreign object stuck under the eyelid, close your eyes and gently clamp the skin of the upper eyelid, gently pull down so that it covers the lower eyelid. Eyes rolled by foreign objects flying into them. If you're lucky, this action will help the foreign object loosen and fall out.\nFor more complicated foreign objects in the eye, you need to handle them as follows:\nWash hands with soap and water.; Try to wash the foreign object out of your eye with warm water, gently.; Take a shower, pour warm water gently on your forehead, keep your eyelids open to let the foreign object float with the water.; If you are wearing contact lenses, it is best to remove them before or during rinsing. Sometimes foreign objects can get stuck on the underside of the lens.\nIn case you help others:\nWash hands with soap and water.; Have the patient sit in a well-lit area; Gently examine the eye for foreign objects. Pull the lower eyelid and ask the person to look up. Then hold the upper eyelid and let your eyes look down.; If the object is in the tear film on the surface of the eye, try using a dropper filled with clean, warm water to rinse the object. Or tilt your head back and irrigate the eye surface with clean water from a drinking glass or gently flowing tap water.\nHowever, you need to note:\nDo not rub or put pressure on your eyes: when something flies into our eyes, our natural reflex is to rub our eyes. But this action can be dangerous. When rubbing your eyes, foreign objects can easily be pushed under the eyelids, piercing the eye or scratching the cornea. If this condition occurs, the eyes can be permanently damaged, even leading to blindness, accompanied by pain.; Do not use any tools, such as tweezers or cotton swabs, on the surface of the eye.; Do not remove contact lenses unless there is sudden swelling or you have suffered a chemical injury.\n2. When do you need to see a doctor?\nForeign bodies in eyes cannot be removed at home.; Blurred or abnormal vision after removing the foreign object; There are unusual changes in vision.; Clear or bloody fluid appears from the eyeball.\nBlurred or abnormal vision after removing a foreign object from the eye requires seeing a doctor for an eye examination.\n\nHospital treatment\nTo treat foreign objects in the eye, the doctor will perform the following procedure:\nA doctor or nurse checks your vision.; Use anesthetic eye drops to numb the eye.; Proceed to find the foreign object and remove it.; Clean your eyes with salt water to remove dirt.; X-ray to check whether the object has entered the eyeball or not; Bandage your eyes to prevent scratches or infection.\n\nSelf-care at home after treating a foreign body in the eye\nOnce the foreign object in your eye is removed, you can take care of your eyes at home. But there are some tips to keep in mind:\nDuring treatment, you should not drive until the eye patch is removed and your vision is restored.; If you experience eye discomfort, you can use pain relievers containing paracetamol or ibuprofen. Follow the instructions on the packaging carefully.; Avoid working with machinery or at heights.; Use eye drops or ointments to prevent infection.; In particular, you need to follow your doctor's advice on schedule to ensure the most effective treatment.\nUse eye drops or ointments to prevent infection.\n\nPrevent foreign bodies in the eye\nThe best way to prevent foreign objects from getting into your eyes is to protect your eyes. Some ways to protect your eyes from foreign objects include:\nAlways wear protective eyewear when working in dusty, windy or flying debris areas.; Use safety glasses or goggles with shields. Regular sunglasses or corrective lenses are not enough.; Do not stand or go near where drilling or soldering is being done; Wear safety glasses when playing certain sports such as tennis or squash.\nWhere to get help\nThe Eye Department at Tam Anh General Hospital System is equipped with modern machinery and equipment and a team of highly specialized doctors to help protect your eyes.\nForeign bodies in the eye, if properly cared for and treated, will heal quickly. However, if the disease is allowed to progress for a long time, the risk of superinfection by viruses or bacteria is very high. The above article has provided information about foreign bodies in the eye, causes, symptoms and prevention. Therefore, when you see signs of the disease, see an eye specialist for timely advice and treatment.",
