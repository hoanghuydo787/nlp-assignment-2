    "content": "Dehydrated disc: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment\n\nDisc dehydration is one of the manifestations of disc aging. The disease causes many troubles in the patient's daily activities. Without early intervention, the disease can progress seriously over time, even requiring surgical intervention.\n\nWhat is a dehydrated disc?\nDehydrated discs (dry discs) are a condition in which the discs lose water, gradually become thinner and lose their elasticity. This condition is also known as disc collapse. (first)\nThis disease progresses with 3 stages:\nFirst stage: The intervertebral discs are slightly dehydrated and have reduced elasticity. However, the vertebrae of the spine are not affected much; Stage two: The disc collapses and gradually becomes thinner. This condition changes the structure of the spine, narrows the space between bones, and begins many diseases related to the spine.; Final stage: At this stage, the bones are fused together. This condition causes severe pain for the patient. The disease at this stage is very difficult to treat completely.\n\nSymptoms when the disc becomes dehydrated\nAt the time of onset, symptoms may be a few mild, dull pains, not sharp pain, so many patients are often subjective and do not seek medical attention. (2)\nOver time, as the disc thins, the patient will have stiffness in the back, causing difficulty in movement. When the disc is too thin, the bones will press on the nerves, causing pain in the back and neck, and can even spread to the arms, legs and feet.\nMost patients with disc dehydration will have symptoms such as:\nDull or severe pain in the cervical or lumbar spine; Pain increases with movements such as bending, standing up, sitting down...; when moving strongly or spreading to other parts such as arms, shoulders, hips, buttocks, thighs.; Muscle weakness, tingling and numbness in the limbs.\n\nCauses of dehydration in the intervertebral disc\nThe aging process is the main cause of disc collapse. As you age, the disc will gradually become weaker. The mucus inside the disc deteriorates with pressure from the vertebrae, causing the disc to collapse and lose its original functions. (3)\nIn addition, disc dehydration is also caused by reasons such as:\nSuffering from bone and joint diseases such as osteoporosis, spinal degeneration...; Injuries while playing sports, falls due to collisions, accidents at work... damage the spine, leading to many diseases related to the spine, including collapsed discs.; Sitting too much or having incorrect sitting posture puts a lot of pressure on the spine, which over time can cause disc degeneration.; Doing heavy work, often lifting heavy objects improperly; Overweight, obese; Unhealthy diet, insufficient nutrients, and smoking are also factors that increase the risk of disc dehydration.\n\nDiagnostic method\nTo diagnose dehydrated discs, the doctor will discuss with the patient some information such as the location of the pain and related symptoms such as numbness or tingling in the limbs.\nDuring the examination, the doctor may evaluate related issues including:\nMuscle strength test: Patients will be checked for muscle atrophy or abnormal muscle movements; Assessing the pain: The doctor may ask the patient to move in different ways to assess the severity of the pain.\nAssess nerve function: The doctor will tap on different positions with a reflex hammer to observe the patient's reaction. Poor response or no response can be a warning sign of nerve root compression. In addition, hot and cold stimulation may be performed to test the nerve's response to temperature changes.\nIn addition, doctors may recommend patients to perform diagnostic methods such as:\nX-ray: X-ray helps detect abnormalities in the structure of the spine and the shape of the disc bones.; CT scan: Assists doctors in determining specific images of vertebrae and disc subsidence; MRI scan: Assists doctors in determining the degree of nerve compression in the affected spinal area.\nIn addition, the doctor can check for other problems such as tumors or injuries that can lead to back pain, assisting in the diagnosis of dehydrated discs.\n\nHow to treat dehydrated discs\nIf there are no symptoms or mild symptoms appear, the doctor may ask the patient to control their weight, exercise regularly and stay away from factors that cause back pain such as lifting heavy objects and sitting for too long. â€¦ (4)\nIf the symptoms of the disease cause discomfort and affect quality of life, the doctor may recommend that the patient apply treatment methods such as:\nNon-surgical treatment\nUsing medication: Pain relievers can help patients improve symptoms. Some medications such as ibuprofen or naproxen can help treat pain caused by a collapsed disc or aid in relaxing the spine. However, the medicine should only be used with a doctor's guidance to avoid unwanted side effects; Massage therapy: Massage and massage can relieve pain caused by dry discs. Furthermore, this method can also help relax the vertebrae.; Physical therapy: Doctors can instruct patients to perform exercises to strengthen the muscles around the spine to reduce pain.; Lose weight: Good weight control can reduce pressure on discs, preventing disc collapse or bulging. Patients should adopt a healthy diet and exercise every day to improve disease symptoms.; Chiropractic therapy: Chiropractic therapy is a conservative method that helps heal pain from the root. The doctor will correct the misaligned structure of the joints and discs, thereby releasing the pressure on the nerve roots and spinal canal. This method helps stimulate the body's self-recovery ability, completely eliminate pain and prevent recurrence.; Epidural corticosteroid injection: This method can help reduce inflammation, swelling, and back pain. The doctor will inject medication under x-ray guidance to ensure accuracy.\nSurgical treatment\nFor severe cases, your doctor may recommend spinal surgery to treat dehydrated discs. However, this method is often not implemented until conservation methods are ineffective.\nCommon surgical methods to treat collapsed discs include:\nArtificial disc replacement: This is a procedure to replace the entire disc. The doctor will remove the damaged disc and replace it with an artificial disc.; Spinal fusion surgery: The doctor removes the damaged disc, then fuses the two vertebrae together to create stability. To make the connection, the doctor performs bone grafting. The bone piece is taken from another place on the body or from a donor, then fixed with screws, rods, or hooks to the spine.\n\nMeasures to prevent dehydration of intervertebral discs\nDisc dehydration is a normal process as the body ages and is very difficult to prevent. However, to slow down the aging process, it should be noted:\nDrink enough water: The body needs to be provided with enough water every day for all activities.; Do not smoke: The chemicals in cigarettes can directly affect the discs in the back, increasing the speed of disc degeneration.; Control your weight well to avoid putting too much pressure on your back and spine, slowing down the process of disc degeneration.; Maintain good spinal posture when sitting, standing or lifting heavy objects to avoid disc damage.; Exercise regularly: Appropriate exercise can help improve muscle health, strengthen the skeletal system and support back movements.\nCenter for Orthopedic Trauma, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is where a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons gather such as: TTND.Prof.Dr.Nguyen Viet Tien; Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa; Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh; MSc.BS.CKII Tran Anh Vu; BS.CKI Tran Xuan Anh, MSc.CKI Le Dinh Khoa, MSc.BS Nguyen Quang Ton Quyen; Dr. Do Tien Dung; Dr. BS.CKII Vu Huu Dung... This is also one of the pioneer units in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal diseases with modern techniques according to updated international protocols.\nThe hospital is also equipped with modern machinery and imaging equipment such as: Somatom Drive 768-slice CT scanner, new generation Magnetom Amira BioMatrix magnetic resonance machine, Artis Pheno robot, densitometer. bones, ultrasound machines...; Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss surgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table... to be able to detect injuries early and effectively treat musculoskeletal diseases...\nTam Anh General Hospital also owns a spacious clinic system and high-class boarding area; modern rehabilitation area; Comprehensive post-operative care process helps patients quickly recover and stabilize their health after surgery.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Orthopedics Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nDehydration of the intervertebral disc occurs due to the body's natural aging process. Without early intervention, symptoms can worsen over time, leading to serious complications. In most cases, symptoms can be controlled with home care measures such as rest, physical therapy, pain relievers, and lifestyle changes. However, if the symptoms become increasingly serious, the patient should quickly talk to a doctor for instructions, timely treatment methods, and prevent risks.",
