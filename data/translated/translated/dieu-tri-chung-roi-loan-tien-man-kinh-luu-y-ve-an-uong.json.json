    "content": "Perimenopause: Causes, signs and treatments\n\nAs women, everyone goes through premenopause and menopause, but up to 20% of women cannot stand the severe symptoms and must be treated with medication. How to get through this stage gently?\n\nWhat is perimenopause?\nPerimenopause is the stage that occurs before menopause. People also call this the menopausal transition period. Depending on each person's constitution, this period can occur at different ages. At the same time, each person will have different symptoms.\nMenopause usually falls between the ages of 45 and 55, marking the end of the reproductive process in women. In other words, when you stop having your period, you are officially in menopause.\nAssociate Professor, Dr. Luu Thi Hong said that women enter the premenopausal stage 8 - 10 years before menopause, i.e. at the age of 37 - 45. This is the active period of the brain's yellow axis system. - Pituitary gland - Ovaries decline, not producing enough female hormones: estrogen, progesterone, testosterone to meet all body activities.\nTherefore, women have to face psychological, physiological, health and beauty disturbances: risk of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disorders, decreased sexual desire, vaginal dryness, and mental irritability. Reasons why people are often angry, depressed, lack of concentration at work, hot flashes, sweating especially at night, insomnia, dizziness, headaches, nervousness, anxiety...\nDuring the final stages of perimenopause, a woman's body produces less and less estrogen. This stage lasts at least a few months and as long as 4 years.\nMenopause officially begins when the ovaries produce so little estrogen that eggs are no longer released. At that time, the menstrual cycle will stop.\n\nNote: 12 most common signs of premenopause in women\nStatistics from the Ho Chi Minh City Society of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility show that, from the age of 30-35, up to a quarter of Vietnamese women begin to face changes in all three aspects of health and beauty. beauty and physiological life, is the opening milestone for women's turbulent pre-menopause-menopause period.\n1. Menstrual disorders\nMenstruation is irregular, some months it comes early, some months it comes late, sometimes it only happens once every 2-3 months because the ovaries have problems releasing eggs (leading to menstruation). However, some gynecological cancers also cause menstrual disorders. Therefore, women should note that if their menstrual periods are irregular for 3 months or more, they must immediately go for a gynecological examination.\n2. Difficulty conceiving\nIn addition to the consequences of menstrual disorders, problems with the ovaries releasing eggs will make it difficult for women at this age to get pregnant naturally. There are many cases where women of this age who want to have children must seek medical intervention.\n3. Hot flashes\nA burning sensation from the chest to the shoulders, neck and face, usually lasting about 2 - 3 minutes or longer, is a common symptom of premenopausal women. Every day, you may have hot flashes \"visited\" many times, especially while sleeping.\n4. Change in personality\nAnother common symptom is that women get angry easily, sometimes become overly sensitive, anxious, or sad. If they are not relieved, depression is the inevitable consequence.\n5. Easily gain weight\nThe older you get, the slower your body's metabolism becomes. Meanwhile, symptoms of stress, anxiety, and insomnia common in premenopause will create conditions for the accumulation of white fat cells. As a result, you easily gain weight, especially the imbalance in your body shape when white fat is often concentrated in the waist, abdomen, thighs, and biceps.\n6. Pain\nChanges in hormone levels when women enter premenopause are the cause of osteoarthritis and breast tenderness.\nInflammation and joint pain are common symptoms in premenopausal women\n7. Changes in cholesterol levels\nImpairment of the brain-pituitary-ovarian axis leads to a decrease in hormones in the body, leading to adverse changes in blood cholesterol levels, including an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. – bad cholesterol and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol – good cholesterol. This condition increases the risk of heart disease in women.\n8. Vaginal dryness\nThe vagina reduces the amount of secretions and elasticity, causing you to feel discomfort, burning pain in the private area, and pain during sex. Vaginal dryness is the reason many women lose interest in sex when entering premenopause.\n9. Bone density decreases\nIf estrogen levels drop significantly, you will be at risk of losing calcium faster than other women, causing bones to become porous, weak, brittle and prone to fracture. This is the cause of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis...\nTo overcome this, you need to supplement your diet with plenty of calcium and vitamin D, and exercise regularly every day. Your doctor may also prescribe calcium supplements to replace lost calcium in your body.\n10. Sleep disorders\nHormonal changes along with night sweats can ruin your good night's sleep. Improve sleep disorders by establishing a regular sleep routine, sleeping before 11 p.m., not taking too many naps (maximum 30 minutes), and not using electronic devices 2 hours before bed. If the condition still does not improve and becomes more serious, you need to talk to your doctor to find effective remedies.\n11. Heavy bleeding during menstruation\nIf suddenly, your bleeding is significantly heavier than in previous menstrual periods, it is likely that you have premenstrual disorder. But it doesn't stop there, a decrease in the hormone progesterone also causes a number of other problems, such as uterine fibroids.\n12. Memory loss\nHormonal changes, along with other perimenopausal symptoms (like mood changes and sleep disorders), can cause your memory to decline. Luckily, forgetfulness will be overcome when you enter menopause.\nAssociate Professor, Dr. Luu Thi Hong emphasized that depending on each person's constitution, symptoms may appear sooner or later. Therefore, women should listen to their bodies to identify signs early and take timely corrective measures, instead of just relying on age.\n\nCauses of premenopausal disorders\nPremenopause and menopause are two stages that occur naturally in a woman's life. The symptoms it causes, although unpleasant, are completely normal and will disappear on their own without medical intervention.\nHowever, many cases do not occur according to the trajectory, that is, they arrive earlier (before age 35) or later (after age 50), and bring with them many inconvenient symptoms, affecting psychology. women's health and work. That is premenopausal disorder, which needs timely intervention to get everything back on track.\nThe deterioration of the Brain - Pituitary - Ovarian axis leads to changes in the trio of hormones Estrogen, Progesterone, Testosterone in the body, which is the main cause of premenopausal disorders in women. The older you get, the stronger and faster the decline process becomes, leading to disorders during this period.\nHowever, some people may enter menopause earlier than usual due to:\nHave a mother or sister who also had early menopause; Premature ovarian failure; Have had the entire uterus or ovaries removed; Undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy during cancer treatment; Suffering from certain diseases such as metabolic disorders, immune system disorders...; Smoking for many years because tobacco is a dangerous factor that reduces female hormone levels in the body.\n\nHow to treat symptoms of premenopausal disorder?\nSome people experience premenopause very gently, but some people cannot endure the series of symptoms of premenopausal disorder. According to Associate Professor, Dr. Luu Thi Hong, depending on each case, doctors prescribe treatment with medication, hormone supplementation therapy... but most women can overcome the problems of this stage with Simple solutions:\n1. About diet\nA reasonable diet helps improve symptoms of premenopausal disorders\nYou should increase protein, omega-3 fatty acids, fiber and calcium in your daily menu.

In addition, protein also helps regulate appetite and blood sugar levels, as well as balance hormone levels in your body. Lean meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans... are good sources of protein.\nOmega-3 fatty acids\nOmega-3 fatty acids are linked to reducing inflammation, improving mood, and preventing depression. Therefore, women need to supplement fatty fish (tuna, mackerel, herring...) in their diet. Fish oil pills are also a good choice if the amount of fatty fish you provide is not enough.\nFiber\nFiber (found in vegetables, tubers, fruits, whole grains, beans...) helps you feel full longer, thereby limiting cravings and maintaining weight. This is especially helpful for premenopausal women, who are susceptible to weight gain due to a slowing metabolism.\nNot only that, fiber has also been shown to help reduce the risk of several aging diseases including heart disease, stroke and cancer.\nCalcium\nWhen the risk of osteoporosis increases, you need to increase calcium intake to 1,200mg/day. Vitamin D is also important because it helps the body absorb maximum calcium. Make friends with skimmed unsweetened milk, beans, shellfish, eggs... because these are rich sources of calcium.\nBesides the foods you should eat, there are some foods you need to limit or absolutely abstain from when entering premenopause, which are:\nFoods rich in saturated fat: animal fats, dairy products such as butter, cheese...; Foods containing highly refined carbohydrates: white bread, noodles, cakes, candy, ice cream...; Drinks containing caffeine\n2. About living regime\nA scientific lifestyle will help you repel the symptoms of premenopausal disorder. Specifically:\nDaily exercise; Stop smoking; Limiting alcohol intake; Try to give yourself a good night's sleep and get enough sleep 7-8 hours/day; Maintain a stable weight with BMI within normal limits\nPremenopausal women need to maintain exercise every day\n3. Using medicine\nIn case your premenopausal symptoms become severe, negatively affecting your quality of life, your doctor will use some types of hormone replacement (Estrogen and Progesterone supplements); endocrine treatment (including systemic or localized estrogen treatment, combined estrogen and progesterone endocrine therapy, estrogen treatment with or without progesterone...).\nHowever, which medicine to take, what dosage, how long to treat... need to be carefully considered by your doctor to avoid health risks. Therefore, women should not take medication on their own but need to go to a reputable medical facility with a gynecological department to have their health checked and have the doctor prescribe the correct medication.\n\nConsulting and treatment of premenopausal disorders at Tam Anh General Hospital\nWith the desire to accompany women during premenopause and menopause to help them overcome this period gently, Tam Anh General Hospital opens examination, consultation, care and treatment services.
