    "content": "Cataracts (dry cataracts): Causes, signs and treatments\n\nCataracts are one of the leading causes of vision loss and blindness in the world and in Vietnam. The disease can appear at any age but is more common in people over 50 years old.\n\nWhat is cataract?\nCataract (or cataract, cataract, cataract) is a vision disorder caused by changes in the protein structure of the lens under the influence of harmful substances produced from within the body. or from the external environment. (first)\nCataracts occur at all ages\nDisturbed protein structure changes the curvature, clarity, elasticity and thickness of the lens, making the lens opaque. This prevents light from passing through, causing visual impairment, making it difficult for the patient to do daily activities such as driving, reading, etc., and even causing complete loss of vision if the condition persists. long.\n\nClassification of cataracts (dry cataracts)\n1. According to morphology and location\nCataracts: Cataracts occur when the hardening and yellowing of the lens nucleus exceeds the central area. This is called cataracts. In the early stages, these two factors cause some refractive errors of the eye, leading to symptoms such as blurred distance vision. Cataracts can occur in one eye.; Shell perforation: This type of shell perforation can enlarge and merge with each other to form larger shell perforation areas. When the entire shell from the capsule to the nucleus becomes white opaque (the lens is completely opaque), it is called mature opacification. This condition occurs in both eyes and is often asymmetrical.; Capsule opacification: A small opacification in the epithelium and anterior capsule of the lens but does not affect the capsule.\n2. Classify by level\nCataract pathology (dry cataracts) is divided into 4 levels: initial cataract, progressive cataract, nearly complete cataract and complete cataract.\nRegardless of the type of cloudy lens (except trauma), basically, the cloudy condition is usually due to the structure and ratio of protein molecules being changed, creating opaque areas in the lens, preventing light reaches the retina and causes vision loss.\n\nSigns of cataracts\nDepending on the progression of the disease, there will be different symptoms.\nIn the early stages, symptoms may appear such as blurred vision, difficulty driving at night, feeling like a veil...; In the later stages, more obvious signs will appear such as changes in lens color, seeing black dots in front of the eyes, being more sensitive to light, reducing color perception, double vision (double vision)...\nThe disease from early to late stages often lasts quite a long time. If you don't pay attention, it can easily be mistaken for common diseases. Therefore, the initial symptoms are easily ignored, and by the time the disease becomes severe, it is too late. (2)\n\nCauses of cataracts\nThe majority of people infected with the disease are older people. The cause comes from the body's natural aging process. Some other causes include congenital disorders or accidents, injuries and complications of systemic diseases. (3)\nThe cause of the disease is the body's natural aging process or congenital diseases...\nIn addition, experts divide the causes of the disease into two main groups:\n1. Primary cause\nCongenital cataracts: Genetic disorders, complications of systemic diseases, metabolic disorders...; Cataracts in the elderly: According to statistics, up to 80% of elderly people over 65 years old have cataracts.\n2. Secondary causes\nRegularly exposed to blue light from electronic device screens, X-rays... more than 3 hours/day; Suffering from other eye diseases such as conjunctivitis, corneal disease... and improper treatment, recurring many times; Regularly exposed to ultraviolet rays from the sun; Using drugs that cause eye side effects (such as corticosteroids, antidepressants, etc.); Degenerative myopia; Eye injuries, complications, sequelae after eye surgery; Suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure...\n3. Factors that increase the risk of disease\nBesides the direct causes of cataracts, related factors include:\nLack of nutrients for the eyes. A diet lacking vitamins, minerals... weakens the protein structure of the lens, over time it cannot ensure its inherent function.; Using stimulants such as alcohol, cigarettes... regularly; Frequent exposure to polluted dusty environments and toxic emissions increases the risk of cataracts at a young age; Stress\n\nDiagnostic\nTo determine if the lens is cloudy, your doctor will review your medical history and perform an eye exam. Some tests may be ordered:\nVision test: You will have both eyes tested one at a time through a chart or specialized equipment with gradually decreasing alphabets. Based on those parameters, the doctor will evaluate your vision.; Eye examination with a microscope: The glasses will magnify the structures in the front of the eye, making it easier for the doctor to detect abnormalities inside the eye.\n\nCataract treatment\nBased on the stages of the disease, patients will be advised on measures to improve vision and treat cataracts appropriately. (4)\n1. Use support glasses\nIn the early stages, when vision has not yet deteriorated much, doctors often let patients wear glasses or use magnifying glasses to help provide essential nutrients to the eyes. Patients should work in a well-lit environment to minimize visual disturbances.\n2. Surgery\nIn cases where the patient cannot use medication or wear glasses, artificial lens replacement surgery is needed. Phaco surgery is one of the safe and effective methods in improving vision for people with the disease.\nModern scientific techniques have brought successful artificial glass replacement surgeries to patients\n\nPrecautions\nProactively prevent cataracts early, have eye examinations immediately when there are signs such as eye fatigue, blurred vision, blurred vision, eye pain, dry eyes, eye irritation...; People with high blood pressure, diabetes... need to share with their doctors the signs they are experiencing, in order to early detect complications that can affect the eyes.; Supplementing essential nutrients through diet, a variety of foods, vitamins, and specialized nutrients to support the lens.; Equip specialized protective equipment according to job characteristics, wear sunglasses when going out to avoid harmful effects of sunlight and dust.; Stay away from risk factors that damage the lens such as alcohol, cigarette smoke, etc.\n\nQuestions about cataracts\nDiet for people after cataract surgery?\nPatients can eat and drink normally after cataract surgery (dry cataract surgery). Patients should increase foods rich in vitamins and minerals that are good for the eyes such as vitamins A, B, C... found in fruits and vegetables (such as tomatoes, carrots, avocados, nuts, kale, cauliflower, vegetables). bina…).\nDo not use alcohol or stimulants; hot spicy food…\nAre cataracts dangerous?\nAccording to statistics, cataract is the main cause of blindness (accounting for 66.1%), followed by fundus diseases, glaucoma, refractive error...\nDelayed detection, subjectivity, and ignoring the initial signs of the disease are the main reasons why the treatment process becomes complicated or irreversible. Blindness is a complication caused by cataracts, creating a burden for the patient, his family and society.\nNot to mention, the disease is getting younger and younger, if there are no measures to prevent, prevent and support early treatment, it will cause great loss to society's human resources.\nThe Eye Clinic at Tam Anh General Hospital System is equipped with modern machinery and equipment and a team of highly qualified doctors and nurses to help protect your eyes.
