    "content": "Curved penis: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis, prevention\n\nAlthough a curved penis is not dangerous, it has a negative impact on men's psychology, sex life, and fertility. Therefore, when seeing an abnormally curved penis, patients should quickly go to reputable medical facilities for timely examination, diagnosis and treatment, to prevent dangerous complications.\n\nWhat is a curved penis?\nCurved penis is a benign disease. The disease is caused by fibrous plaques or hardened lumps that develop between the two layers of the erectile tissue in the penis (cavernosus), causing contraction and adhesion. This causes the penis to curve and deform when erect. (first)\nIf fibrous plaque develops on the back of the penis, it will cause the penis to curve upward. Meanwhile, fibrous plaques that develop on the ventral surface of the penis will cause the penis to curve downwards. In some cases, fibrous plaques develop on both sides, causing the penis to become concave and shortened.\n\nCauses of penis curvature\nPeyronie's disease: This is a condition in which scar tissue appears on the penis, causing the penis to curve up, down, to the left or to the right when erect, depending on the location of the scar. The patient's penis can curve at an angle from 15° to more than 90°.; Congenital: Curvature of the penis is influenced by genetic factors. Men who have a relative with a curved penis are at very high risk of developing this condition.; Penile fracture (broken corpus cavernosum): This is an objective cause of penile curvature. Accidents in traffic, work, and daily life can cause damage to the penis. Due to direct impact from external forces, the penis can bend or even break.; Connective tissue disorders: Men with connective tissue disorders are more likely to face penile curvature.; Excessive sex: Men who have sex too much, in the wrong position, especially using stimulants and have rough behavior during intercourse can cause damage to the penis. The penis can bleed, hematoma, and over time form fibrous plaques. Fibrous plaque clinging to the penis will cause the penis to curve when erect.\n\nSymptoms of a curved penis\nPatients with penile curvature often have symptoms such as: (2)\nThere is a hard lump or a thickened area on the shaft of the penis.; When erect, the penis curves, usually upwards.; Penile pain, especially when erect; Deviation of the penis to the left or right.; Penis shrinks in length or diameter.\n\nIs a curved penis normal?\nIn cases where the penis is slightly curved and does not cause any unpleasant symptoms, men do not need to see a doctor. However, if the curve of the penis causes difficulty, pain or inability to have sex, the patient should quickly go to a reputable medical facility for examination, diagnosis and timely intervention. .\nCurvature of the penis, if not properly treated, can lead to erectile dysfunction. Doctors often prescribe treatment in cases where the penis has a curve of 30° or more, accompanied by problems during sexual intercourse.\nAfter an injury, the penis may become curved. Pain during erection may be due to post-traumatic inflammation. Men may have pain for months, only getting better when the wound heals and the scar tissue hardens.\nYou may be interested in: What are sexually transmitted diseases? 11 dangerous sexual diseases\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nIn addition to adjusting the position and angle of penetration during sex, men should also monitor the condition of their penis and see a doctor early when: (3)\nPenile curvature has only recently appeared.; The angle of curvature of the penis is too large.; Penile curvature gradually increases.; Pain during erection, especially during sex; Indentations appear on the penis; The appearance of nodules in the tissue of the penis\nThe above symptoms may be a warning sign of injury or Peyronie's disease, not of a congenitally curved penis. Patients should see a doctor early to get advice on some remedies such as using medicine, surgery or changing lifestyle.\n\nDiagnosis of curved penis\nWhen making a diagnosis, the doctor usually asks the patient about symptoms, history of injury, and conducts an examination of the penis. The doctor can measure the degree of curvature of the penis by injecting an erection-stimulant drug. Men may also request a penile ultrasound.\n\nHow to treat a curved penis\n1. Non-surgical treatment method\nMedical treatment is indicated for patients with mild curvature of the penis, without pain or affecting sexual function. Some cases of the disease can be cured without medical intervention. Non-surgical methods to treat penile curvature include:\nUse anti-inflammatory drugs like corticosteroids and vitamin E combined with pain relief if the patient feels a lot of pain and affects daily activities.; Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT): This is a targeted treatment. The doctor will use an ultrasound scanner to shine directly on the tumor area or protruding patches on the penis. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy has high safety and effectiveness, which still needs to be thoroughly evaluated.\n2. Surgical treatment methods\nSurgery is often indicated for more serious cases. Indications are usually people with a severely curved penis, pain or affecting sexual ability. Doctors often ask patients to continue monitoring for at least 12 months before deciding on surgery. Because in many cases, the disease can be improved without treatment.\nThe purpose of surgery is to straighten the penis by:\nCut tumors, graft skin or connect veins; Implantation of a straightening device into the penis; Apply pressure to the area opposite the penis site where the tumor is located to prevent the penis from bending. This method can change the size of the penis.\n\nMeasures to prevent a curved penis\nAny abnormality related to the genitals affects men's psychology and sexual life, including a curved penis. To limit the risk of this condition, men should note:\nPrioritize choosing loose and airy underwear. When sleeping, you may not need to wear underwear.; Avoid masturbation or rough sex.; When having sex, men should choose positions that bring the most comfort to both; Do not use stimulants, alcohol and do not smoke; Properly and promptly handle and treat injuries occurring in private areas; Perform screening when a family member has a curved penis.; When experiencing discomfort during urination and sexual intercourse, men need to quickly see a doctor for diagnosis and timely measures. You should go to reputable medical facilities to limit risks in treatment.; Absolutely do not use medications without a doctor's prescription. Especially \"word of mouth\" folk remedies, whose origin, origin and uses are unknown.\nCenter for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology - Urology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts, Internal Medicine and Surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
