    "content": "Grade 2 fatty liver: Causes, symptoms and treatment\n\nLevel 2 fatty liver is an intermediate stage, a transitional \"bridge\" between mild fatty liver (level 1) and severe level (level 3). The amount of fat accumulated in the liver can now account for up to 20% of liver mass, along with many liver functions being more severely impaired.\n\nWhat is grade 2 fatty liver?\nFatty liver is a condition in which fat accumulates in the liver, which may or may not cause inflammation. If fatty liver has inflammation in the liver, it is called fatty liver disease. The disease has levels: fatty liver level 1, fatty liver level 2 and fatty liver level 3. Level 2 fatty liver is a stage with more specific symptoms than level 1 such as loss of appetite and fatigue. tired, press your hand on the area where the liver feels painful. If the disease is detected and treated early, it can be cured without much affecting liver function or causing complications.(1)\nGrade 2 fatty liver has fat accumulation accounting for 10-25% of liver weight\n\nCauses of grade 2 fatty liver\nGrade 2 fatty liver often originates from some of the common causes below:\nAlcoholic beverages: Beer, especially alcohol, when entering the body, will increase the amount of free fatty acids while disrupting the liver's fat oxidation process. In addition, alcoholic beverages also destroy lipids as well as increase the level of triglycerides (blood fat index) accumulated in the liver. This is considered the leading cause of fatty liver; Alcoholic beverages: Beer, especially alcohol, when entering the body, will increase the amount of free fatty acids while disrupting the liver's fat oxidation process. In addition, alcoholic beverages also destroy lipids as well as increase the level of triglycerides (blood fat index) accumulated in the liver. This is considered the leading cause of fatty liver.\nEating habits: Consuming too much fatty foods such as animal organs, fried/fried foods, fast food, etc. makes the liver unable to process and metabolize all fats. If this problem lasts for a long time, it will increase the amount of fat accumulated in the liver.; Eating habits: Consuming too much fatty foods such as animal organs, fried/fried foods, fast food, etc. makes the liver unable to process and metabolize all fats. If this problem lasts for a long time, it will increase the amount of fat accumulated in the liver.\nHigh/low blood sugar: People with diabetes are at risk of fatty liver - higher than healthy people. The reason is that when blood sugar increases, it will partially reduce the liver's ability to remove \"bad\" LDL cholesterol. Over time, this causes the liver to accumulate more cholesterol and lead to fatty liver disease. On the contrary, when blood sugar drops low (for example due to fasting), the body will have to release a certain amount to compensate for energy - if it is high and frequent, it will also increase the amount of fat in the liver. ; High/low blood sugar: People with diabetes are at risk of fatty liver - higher than healthy people.

On the contrary, when blood sugar drops low (for example due to fasting), the body will have to release a certain amount to compensate for energy - if it is high and frequent, it will also increase the amount of fat in the liver.\nLaziness: Laziness leads to many negative consequences such as increasing the risk of being overweight, obese, reducing metabolic rate, etc. A lot of energy is absorbed into the body but is not released and will be transferred to the body. turns into fat. The increased amount of fat will be a burden on the liver.; Laziness: Laziness leads to many negative consequences such as increasing the risk of being overweight, obese, reducing metabolic rate, etc. A lot of energy is absorbed into the body but is not released and will be transferred to the body. turns into fat. The increased amount of fat will be a burden on the liver.\nIn addition, a number of other possible causes such as pregnancy, drug effects, hepatitis C infection or family medical history can also cause the disease.\nAlcohol, unhealthy eating habits, etc. are the main causes of level 2 fatty liver\n\nHow to diagnose level 2 fatty liver\nDepending on the doctor's instructions, patients can diagnose fatty liver through methods such as:\nBlood test: To determine whether the patient has high liver enzymes or not. High liver enzymes are a sign that the liver is damaged. Test for lipid metabolism disorders in the blood. However, this is just the first step, to determine whether you have fatty liver or not, other tests will be needed; Blood test: To determine whether the patient has high liver enzymes or not. High liver enzymes are a sign that the liver is damaged. Test for lipid metabolism disorders in the blood. However, this is just the first step, to determine whether you have fatty liver or not, other tests will be needed.\nUltrasound or CT scan (computed tomography): Provides images of the liver; Ultrasound or CT scan (computed tomography): Provides images of the liver.\nLiver MRI (magnetic resonance): high sensitivity and specificity to evaluate fatty liver and liver diseases.; Liver MRI (magnetic resonance): high sensitivity and specificity to evaluate fatty liver and liver diseases.\n\nHow to treat grade 2 fatty liver\nTreating fatty liver requires a combination of scientific diet and lifestyle adjustments and medication when needed.\n1. Use medication to treat grade 2 fatty liver\nThere are many medications that patients can use but require a doctor's prescription. If you arbitrarily use the drug, it can cause more damage to the liver.\nDrugs used to treat fatty liver today include: drugs to treat lipoprotein metabolism disorders, high doses of vitamin E. These are drugs that have the ability to increase nutrients, detoxify the liver, restore damaged liver cells, and prevent fat in the liver.(1)\n2. Build a scientific diet\nIn addition to adjusting scientific eating habits according to the basics below, people with fatty liver also need to pay attention to combining exercise and sports for at least 30 minutes a day.\nAbstain from alcohol: Alcoholic beverages are a factor that needs to be eliminated immediately if you have liver diseases to avoid causing liver cells to quickly become fibrotic, causing liver failure and liver cancer.; Abstain from alcohol: Alcoholic beverages are a factor that needs to be eliminated immediately if you have liver diseases to avoid causing liver cells to quickly become fibrotic, causing liver failure and liver cancer.\nReduce carbohydrate intake: Starch and sugar are two sources of carbohydrates that people with fatty liver disease need to reduce to avoid increasing blood sugar, making liver fatty liver disease worse.; Reduce carbohydrate intake: Starch and sugar are two sources of carbohydrates that people with fatty liver disease need to reduce to avoid increasing blood sugar, making fatty liver disease worse.\nLimit consumption of cholesterol-rich foods: Animal organs, fried foods, processed meat, cakes, ice cream, etc. are cholesterol-rich foods that should be avoided.; Limit consumption of cholesterol-rich foods: Animal organs, fried foods, processed meat, cakes, ice cream, etc. are cholesterol-rich foods that should be avoided.\nDrink enough water: Helps eliminate toxins and improve liver health.; Drink enough water: Helps eliminate toxins and improve liver health.\nSupplement omega-3: Supplement foods rich in omega-3 or functional foods such as fish oil to increase HDL cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) to help reduce cholesterol in the blood and tissues.; Supplement omega-3: Supplement foods rich in omega-3 or functional foods such as fish oil to increase HDL cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) to help reduce cholesterol in the blood and tissues.\nIncrease fiber: Green vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole grains not only provide abundant fiber but also provide the body with large amounts of vitamins and minerals to help strengthen the immune system. Improved overall health will lead to improved liver function.; Increase fiber: Green vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole grains not only provide abundant fiber but also provide the body with large amounts of vitamins and minerals to help strengthen the immune system. Improved overall health will lead to improved liver function.\n3. Can grade 2 fatty liver disease be cured?\nFatty liver can be cured, but on the condition that it is detected and treated early to increase the efficiency of liver recovery.\n\nHow to prevent grade 2 fatty liver disease\nChanging your diet, abstaining from alcohol, increasing exercise according to your doctor's advice, checking your blood sugar/treating if you have diabetes, getting vaccinated against hepatitis B and having your liver checked regularly are important things to help you. Effectively prevent fatty liver disease.\nNot only fatty liver, but the above 5 things can also help you reduce the risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, blood fat or diabetes.\n\nDiet for people with grade 2 fatty liver\nDiet for people with fatty liver disease needs to focus on helping the liver lose fat, even if weight loss is not yet possible. Eating at this time will focus on plant-based foods and healthy fats. Specifically includes:\nFruits and vegetables: Apples, bananas, green leafy vegetables, broccoli, potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, beans, etc. are healthy choices that provide plenty of fiber and vitamins. helps the body increase resistance, thereby also improving liver health.; Fruits and vegetables: Apples, bananas, green leafy vegetables, broccoli, potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, beans, etc. are healthy choices that provide plenty of fiber and vitamins. for the body to help increase resistance, thereby also improving liver health.\nFish and lean meat: Fish and lean meat, white meat like chicken, are food groups that can be used by people with fatty liver, in moderate amounts.; Fish and lean meat: Fish and lean meat, white meat like chicken, are food groups that can be used by people with fatty liver, in moderate amounts.\nGrains: Unprocessed grains such as whole-wheat bread, oats, brown rice, quinoa, etc. add fiber with high nutritional content.
