    "content": "Grade 3 fatty liver: Causes, signs and treatments\n\nAmong the levels, level 3 fatty liver is the most severe condition of the disease. At this stage, fatty liver has the potential to turn into dangerous complications.\n\nWhat is grade 3 fatty liver?\nFatty liver is a condition in which the amount of fat in the liver is higher than normal. Grade 3 fatty liver is the highest level, considered the most severe stage of the disease. The amount of fat accumulated in the liver now accounts for 66% or more of the liver weight.\nObese people with high belly fat, people with diabetes or high cholesterol, etc. are at high risk of developing fatty liver. If not detected early, the disease can easily turn into level 3 fatty liver.\nThe amount of excess fat in the liver in level 3 fatty liver can reach more than 66% of liver weight\n\nWhat causes grade 3 fatty liver?\n1. Alcohol abuse\nAlcohol and alcoholic beverages are one of the leading causes of liver damage. Alcohol abuse causes liver poisoning. Alcohol from beer attacks and damages liver cells, weakening the liver's detoxification function.\n2. Using medicine incorrectly\nSome drugs such as steroid inflammation-reducing drugs, breast cancer treatment drug Tamoxifen, etc., if used for a long time without consulting a doctor, have the risk of leading to grade 3 fatty liver. The reason is that using drugs Indiscriminately, too much causes the liver to work overtime; Fat that is not metabolized will be deposited in the liver.\n3. Unscientific nutritional diet\nThe habit of regularly consuming foods high in fat, cholesterol, sugar, and starch makes the liver unable to eliminate all the excess fat loaded into the body. If combined with lack of exercise, it is even more likely to develop level 3 fatty liver disease.\n4. Obesity\nThis is a reason closely related to an unhealthy diet. Obese people, especially those with larger waist circumferences, have a higher risk of developing grade 3 fatty liver. If you have grade 1 fatty liver or grade 2 fatty liver, you are also at risk of becoming more severe. Not only the liver, other organs in the body of overweight/obese people also suffer many negative effects due to pressure from excess fat.\n5. Influenced by diseases\nThere are many cases of people with level 3 fatty liver due to the impact and related to other health problems such as diabetes, fatty blood, high blood pressure or polycystic ovary syndrome, ovarian cancer. Pituitary disorders, etc. These diseases can cause liver dysfunction, leading to the development of fatty liver disease at the highest level. (2)\n6. Other causes\nOlder people, people who smoke, genetics, a history of hepatitis C or exposure to toxic substances are also likely to be risk factors for grade 3 fatty liver.\nObese people are at high risk of fatty liver\n\nSigns of grade 3 fatty liver\nAt level 3, excess fat has invaded almost the entire liver; present in most liver cells and affects the liver's ability to function.\nPatients rarely recognize the symptoms of grade 3 fatty liver disease, but the disease is often detected thanks to ultrasound.\n\nIs level 3 fatty liver dangerous?\nFatty liver is mostly not dangerous for patients. However, grade 3 fatty liver can progress to cirrhosis. If cirrhosis is not treated early, it will become more severe or cause liver cancer. At this time, the patient's life will be threatened, and a liver transplant may be needed to maintain life.\n\nDiagnosis and treatment of level 3 fatty liver\n1. Diagnosis of the disease\nFirst, the doctor will ask about family medical history, drinking/eating habits, medications you are taking as well as review clinical symptoms. Some more in-depth tests will then be needed to determine whether a person is suffering from level 3 fatty liver.\nBlood tests check liver enzymes; Abdominal ultrasound is a familiar diagnostic method to check liver condition for fatty liver or cirrhosis. CT scan (computerized tomography), MRI scan (magnetic resonance imaging); Liver biopsy is only performed in some special cases\n2. How to treat grade 3 fatty liver\nHome treatments are useful in treating grade 3 fatty liver disease. At this level, patients need medical examination and treatment from a doctor to control symptoms and prevent the disease. complications arise.(2)\nAlthough there is no specific medicine, patients need to treat accompanying diseases such as type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, etc. and vitamin E and thiazolidinediones in some special cases. to restore liver cells when treating grade 3 fatty liver.\nIf you have fatty liver, you need to know how to rebuild your diet and exercise. Accordingly, it is necessary to focus on the following issues:\nAbstain from alcohol and alcoholic beverages completely; No smoking; Increase fiber; Supplement foods rich in omega-3; Limit foods high in fat, cholesterol, starch, foods high in sugar/salt; Exercise regularly every day\n3.

The center brings together a team of highly specialized and experienced Internal Medicine - Surgery - Gastrointestinal Endoscopy doctors, in addition to the support of a modern medical equipment system imported from abroad, providing optimal service. multiple examination and treatment needs of customers.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of liver diseases with experts at the Gastrointestinal Endoscopy & Surgery Center of Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nGrade 3 fatty liver is an alarming level that shows that the liver is at risk of getting worse.
