    "content": "Fatty liver: Causes, symptoms and prevention\n\nFatty liver is a condition in which excessive fat accumulates in liver tissue and can be inflammatory or non-inflammatory. If detected and treated early, the disease can be cured without affecting liver function or limiting complications.\n\nWhat is fatty liver?\nDr. Vu Truong Khanh, head of the Department of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreas, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, said that fatty liver is a condition of fat accumulation in liver cells. When there is simple fatty liver without inflammation, it does not progress to chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Fatty liver that causes inflammation in the liver is called fatty liver disease.\nFatty liver disease can occur due to alcohol and non-alcoholic causes, also known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NAFLD). About 30% of people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease will have hepatitis, leading to chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. On ultrasound, fatty liver can be divided into grade I, II or III, but the severity and danger of fatty liver are not commensurate with the severity on ultrasound. In the early stages, fatty liver disease usually does not affect liver function much, but over time, the disease will become more and more serious and lead to many dangerous complications.(1)\n\nSymptoms of fatty liver\nFatty liver in the early stages often has no symptoms, but is discovered accidentally during liver ultrasound examination. When you have fatty liver disease or hepatitis or cirrhosis, you will have the following symptoms:\nPain and discomfort in the right upper abdomen; Anorexia; There may be yellow skin and eyes, yellow or dark urine; When cirrhosis is present, additional symptoms may appear:; Abdominal ascites, leg edema; Dilation of blood vessels under the skin; Enlarged spleen; Gastrointestinal bleeding; Swollen feet; Red palms; Itchy skin\n\nCauses of fatty liver\nThe main cause of the disease is drinking a lot of alcohol or alcoholic drinks for a long time. In addition, people with the following health conditions are also at higher risk of getting the disease:(2)\nOverweight, obesity; High blood cholesterol levels; People with hepatitis; Type 2 diabetes; Risk factors; Polycystic ovary syndrome; Sleep apnea; Impaired thyroid function (hypothyroidism); Impaired pituitary function (hypopituitarism); Elderly\nSome tests reflect liver cell inflammation and cirrhosis\nTo know whether there is hepatitis or not, doctors often rely on a number of indicators: ALT (SGPT), AST (SGOT), ALP, GGT and < 35 U/L for men and < 25U/l for women. In a healthy state, these indicators will fluctuate within the range:\nALT (Alanine Transaminase): < 35 U/L for men and < 25U/l for women; AST (Aspartate Transaminase): < 35 U/L for men and < 25U/l for women; ALP (alkaline phosphorus – APL): 64 – 306 U/L; GGT (Gamma-glutamyltransferase): in men < 55 U/L, in women < 38 U/L; Total bilirubin: 3.4 – 17.1 μmol/L.; Direct bilirubin: 0 – 7 μmol/L; Indirect bilirubin: 1 – 17 μmol/L\nWhen this test increases, it reflects inflammation in the liver. However, if the test is normal, it cannot rule out whether there is secret inflammation in the liver or not.\nIf fatty liver is suspected to progress to cirrhosis, the patient will be prescribed additional liver function tests such as prothrombin ratio, albumin...\n\nDiagnosis of fatty liver disease\nIn the early stages, fatty liver often has no obvious symptoms, so it is difficult to diagnose. Diagnosis is based on history of drinking alcohol, or being overweight or obese... and suggesting fatty liver on ultrasound.\n1.  Blood test\nThis is the preferred test to use, aiming to:; CBC; Check liver enzyme levels and liver function; Measure blood sugar; Check blood fat levels\n2.  Test for hepatitis virus\nTo look for the presence of viruses that cause chronic hepatitis such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and other liver diseases.\n\nDangerous complications of fatty liver\nDr. Khanh shared that alcohol is the second leading factor leading to alcoholic cirrhosis after hepatitis B virus. Therefore, the best way to prevent this disease is to limit alcohol and when hepatitis is present, then Absolutely do not drink alcohol. (3)\n1. Hepatitis\nThis complication occurs when more and more fat covers liver cells, impairing liver function. Liver disease will progress quickly when you have hepatitis B or C virus and drink a lot of alcohol.\nTypical signs when the disease develops to this stage are loss of appetite and fatigue, but there are not always clear symptoms.\n2. Cirrhosis\nThis is the main complication of fatty liver disease. When the liver tries to stop ongoing damage, such as inflammation, it creates areas of scarring (fibrosis). If hepatitis does not stop, the fibrosis process will continue to spread.\n3. Liver cancer\nFatty liver disease silently progresses and gets worse, which can lead to complications of cirrhosis and, most dangerously, complications of liver cancer. This is a consequence of hepatitis due to long-term fatty liver.\n\nTreatment of fatty liver\nCurrently, medicine has not yet found a specific treatment for fatty liver disease. Fatty liver treatment methods only aim to reduce the effects of disease symptoms on daily activities and prevent the disease from progressing seriously. A healthy lifestyle, no alcohol and good control of other diseases (if any) is the optimal method not only in treating but also preventing fatty liver. Especially weight loss for overweight and obese people.(4)\n\nWhat to do to prevent fatty liver disease?\nA scientific lifestyle is a decisive factor in preventing fatty liver. Accordingly, patients should:\nFollow a reasonable nutritional regimen. Increase fiber and good protein; Limit fat such as limiting fried foods, reducing starch and sugar intake; Exercise: This is a very important factor, regular exercise with appropriate intensity helps control and maintain a healthy weight. Regular health check-ups, vaccinations, protect the body. cure hepatitis diseases. If you have any diseases; Other liver problems, you need to take medicine as prescribed by your doctor\n\nNutrition for sick people\nIn the daily diet, people with fatty liver disease should note:\n1. Foods to eat\nVegetables and fruits contain many antioxidants, are rich in fiber, have the effect of reducing cholesterol, and are very good for people with fatty liver disease; Use vegetable oils such as sesame oil, soybean oil... which contain unsaturated fatty acids, reducing cholesterol; Increase fish servings. This is a low-fat source of protein, rich in omega-3 acids, very good for health as it helps reduce cholesterol levels, reducing the risk of fatty liver and cancer.\n2. Food needs to be limited\nQuit wine, beer and other alcoholic drinks. This group of drinks is one of the main factors causing functional impairment and damage to liver cells (5); Limit the use of animal fats; Avoid foods rich in cholesterol such as offal, animal skin, egg yolks...; Reduce your intake of red meat such as beef, pork... because this food group contains a lot of protein and forces the liver to work harder to metabolize it.\n\nfrequently asked Questions\nDr. Khanh answers some more frequently asked questions about fatty liver:\n1. Is fatty liver dangerous?\nIn the early stages, fatty liver does not affect liver function much, so the disease is not dangerous. However, if not treated promptly, this disease will develop into hepatitis, cirrhosis, greatly affecting the patient's health, and even liver cancer, threatening life.\n2. Is fatty liver disease contagious?\nFatty liver is a disease that occurs due to the accumulation of fat in liver cells, not due to viruses or bacteria. Therefore, fatty liver disease is not contagious.\n3. Can you get pregnant with fatty liver disease?\nFatty liver does not affect fertility, so patients can still get pregnant. But it should be noted that the level of fatty liver will affect the health of mother and baby during pregnancy. Specifically, in the fatty liver stage, liver function has not been damaged much, so it has little effect on pregnancy if the patient becomes pregnant. However, severe fatty liver or acute steatohepatitis of pregnancy will seriously threaten the patient's health. Although it is very rare, if acute fatty liver occurs, especially in the last 3 months of pregnancy, it can lead to death.\nCenter for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City) and Department of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreatic (Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing Effective examination and treatment services for patients with mild to severe liver problems (fatty liver, acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer...). Tam Anh General Hospital system brings together a team of highly specialized and experienced Internal Medicine - Surgery - Gastrointestinal Endoscopy doctors, in addition to the support of a modern medical equipment system imported from abroad. in addition, serving the maximum examination and treatment needs of customers.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of liver diseases with gastroenterology specialists of Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nFatty liver disease is an early warning sign to help avoid cirrhosis or liver cancer. Even if there are no symptoms or any problems with liver function, regular examinations and liver tests should be performed to ensure health.",
