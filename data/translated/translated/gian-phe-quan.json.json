If not treated promptly and properly,\nPatients may have complications such as recurrent pneumonia, severe hemoptysis, difficulty breathing - respiratory failure appears frequently.\n. So how to recognize early b\nBronchiectasis\n to get the right treatment?\n Bronchiectasis\n accounts for 6% of lung diseases, more men than women. Vietnam does not have complete statistics, however, according to research by Prof. Dr. Ngo Quy Chau, about 1.86% of patients admitted to the Department of Respiratory Medicine receive inpatient treatment because of bronchiectasis. The disease tends to increase due to its association with bronchial infections in the context of increasingly severe air pollution and climate change.\n\nWhat is bronchiectasis?\nBronchiectasis (Bronchiectasis in English) is a condition of irreversible dilation of part of the bronchial tree, which can be dilatation in large bronchi while small bronchi remain normal, or dilatation in small bronchi while large bronchi remain normal. Normal. (first)\nThe disease is an irreversible condition of one or more bronchi\nBronchiectasis is divided into saccular bronchiectasis, cylindrical bronchiectasis and rosary bronchiectasis based on pathology.\n\nCauses of bronchiectasis\nProf. Dr. Ngo Quy Chau said that there are many reasons why patients' bronchi become dilated, including: (2)\nBronchiectasis due to bronchial obstruction: Bronchial obstruction due to foreign objects: When foreign objects enter the bronchi and block the bronchi, leading to the bronchi below the blockage being dilated due to the inflammatory process causing destruction of the bronchial wall. Usually appears 6-8 weeks after the foreign body appears. Bronchial obstruction due to tumor in the bronchial lumen: Progresses quickly or slowly depending on the progression of the tumor and the level of superinfection. Bronchial obstruction due to old scars from injuries and infections; Bronchial obstruction due to a foreign object: When a foreign object enters the bronchus, it blocks the bronchus, leading to the bronchus below the blockage being dilated due to the inflammatory process causing destruction of the bronchial wall. Usually appears 6-8 weeks after the foreign body appears; Bronchial obstruction due to tumor in the bronchial lumen: Progresses quickly or slowly depending on the progression of the tumor and the level of superinfection.; Bronchial obstruction due to old scars from injuries and infections; Bronchiectasis due to inflammation and necrosis of bronchial walls: After lung infections such as tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia, measles virus, whooping cough,...; Bronchiectasis due to congenital defects in bronchial structure: Kartagener syndrome, Williams - Campbell syndrome,...; Primary bronchiectasis, cause unknown.\n\nSymptoms of bronchiectasis are common\nAccording to Prof. Dr. Ngo Quy Chau, the disease often begins with bronchial damage at a young age, but it is only when the lung infection recurs many times that clear signs and symptoms appear. obvious. These symptoms will develop quickly and get worse over time, even becoming chronic. Therefore, patients need to recognize the signs of the disease early to get timely treatment.\nThe most typical and common symptom is cough and phlegm that lasts for many years; Purulent sputum is green or yellow, in some cases the sputum is mixed with blood;; Sputum production often increases when there is superinfection;; There are some cases of dry cough or no cough (Dry bronchiectasis in the upper lobes);; Some cases have signs of polysinusitis leading to bronchial sinus syndrome.\nPeople with the disease have symptoms of prolonged coughing, coughing up phlegm, and even coughing up blood\n1. Coughing up blood\nCoughing up blood is also one of the symptoms of bronchiectasis. (5)\nMay be the only symptom of the disease;; Coughing up blood recurs many times, which can last for many years;; The severity of hemoptysis can range from mild to moderate hemoptysis to severe hemoptysis to very severe hemoptysis and/or cause acute respiratory failure.\nCoughing up blood is also one of the common symptoms in patients with lung cancer. You can refer to the overview article on lung cancer here to learn more about some other symptoms, avoiding confusion between these two diseases.\n2. Difficulty breathing, whistling sound\nOften appears late, is a manifestation of respiratory failure due to diffuse damage to both lungs, and may be cyanotic.\n3. Fever\nWhen lower respiratory tract infection occurs, fever is often accompanied by increased sputum and/or changes in sputum color.\n4. Chest pain or chest tightness\nThis is a sign of lung infection in the area near the pleura or dilated bronchial sacs.\nThese symptoms often develop over many years and become worse over time or with respiratory infections.\n\nDangerous complications\n“If the disease is detected early and treated promptly and properly, it can be completely cured. In case the disease is detected at a late stage, or the disease is detected but not treated properly, it can cause bronchiectasis to spread, leading to recurrent superinfection, and the patient can experience many dangerous complications. , Prof. Dr. Ngo Quy Chau recommended.\nWhen bronchiectasis spreads and persists, the disease can lead to dangerous complications such as lung abscess, pleural pus, pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, bronchial pus, and pulmonary empyema causing difficulty breathing and respiratory failure. severe respiratory failure, even affecting heart function, causing heart failure.\nRespiratory failure: This condition occurs when the lungs do not supply enough oxygen to the body even at rest.; Right heart failure: Patients often have difficulty breathing, gradually getting worse; Recurrent pneumonia.; Coughing up blood is severe, even life-threatening, due to blood clots filling the airways.\nIf not treated promptly and properly, the patient may experience dangerous complications\n\nMethod for diagnosing bronchiectasis syndrome\nFirst, bronchiectasis is diagnosed based on persistent cough and sputum production, or recurrent hemoptysis in patients, who may have cupped nails.\nThen, to accurately diagnose the extent of bronchial damage, as well as find the cause of the disease for the most effective treatment, the patient may be prescribed a number of imaging tests.\nHigh-resolution chest computed tomography with images of bronchiectasis.; Bronchoscopy: To detect foreign bodies, kinked and narrowed bronchi, determine the location of bleeding and aspirate bronchial fluid to look for bacteria.; Sputum tests: Look for bacteria, fungi, and tuberculosis bacilli, thereby helping to choose appropriate antibiotics for treatment.; Do an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram to detect early heart complications; Measuring respiratory function: Assess lung function and activity, determine the level of lung damage.\n\nTreatment regimen for bronchiectasis\nAccording to Prof. Dr. Ngo Quy Chau, bronchiectasis is irreversible damage. However, treatment will help reduce symptoms and progression of the disease, prevent the vicious cycle of repeated infections, and improve the patient's quality of life. (3)\n1. Drainage of bronchial sputum\nInstruct the patient how to cough and expectorate phlegm and chest vibration combined with postural drainage.\n2. Treatment with antibiotics\nAntibiotics are used in acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis with superinfection.\n3. Treat symptoms\nBronchodilators are indicated for treatment when there is wheezing or snoring in the lungs; Give oxygen during an acute attack when there is hypoxemia.\n4. Treatment of coughing up blood\nDepending on the severity of hemoptysis, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, the doctor will prescribe different treatments.\n5. Surgical treatment\nRemoval of a lobe or one side of the lung in case of severe or persistent hemoptysis, blockage due to tumor...\nPatients need to comply with the treatment regimen and follow-up appointments as scheduled\n\nHow to prevent bronchiectasis?\nThe disease can be transmitted from sick people to healthy people due to viruses that cause the disease through the respiratory tract. Preventing pathogens helps reduce the risk of disease, while also saving costs because treatment is quite complex and expensive. (4)\nProf. Dr. Ngo Quy Chau shared some effective disease prevention measures such as:\nVaccinate against influenza and pneumococcus annually;; Do not smoke cigarettes, pipe tobacco, avoid environments with lots of dust;; Clean teeth, ears, nose and throat;; Early treatment if you have ear, nose and throat infections, dental diseases and respiratory diseases such as acute bronchitis, lung abscess;; Exercise, increase the body's resistance, keep the neck and chest warm... to prevent superinfections for patients with a history of the disease.; Prevent and remove foreign objects in the bronchi early.; Early treatment of primary tuberculosis in children.\nFull vaccination helps reduce the incidence of post-tuberculosis\nWebsite: https://tamanhhospital.vn/; Hotline: 024 3872 3872; Fanpage: https://www.facebook.com/benhvientamanh; Address: 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep Street, Bo De Ward, Long Bien District, Hanoi City\nEarly detection of signs of post-tuberculosis bronchiectasis is important for effective diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Patients need to immediately go to reputable medical facilities for examination and necessary tests in cases of prolonged cough and phlegm.\nThuy Nguyen",
