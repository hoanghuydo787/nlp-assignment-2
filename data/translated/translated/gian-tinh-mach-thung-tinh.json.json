    "content": "Varicocele: Causes, symptoms, treatment\n\nAccording to research, about 15-17% of men experience varicocele, mainly in adulthood. This is a common disease in Andrology, affecting men's reproductive health, because it reduces testicular function. So what is a varicocele? Causes, consequences and how to treat this disease?\n\nWhat is a varicocele?\nVaricocele is a dilated condition of the plexus of spermatic veins and spermatic veins, located above the testicles. This phenomenon often appears in the left testicle, accounting for 90%. About 10% of the remaining cases are bilateral. Only about 1% of male children < 10 years old have this condition. This is one of the reasons causing male infertility.\n\nCauses of varicocele\nThe direct cause is still being researched, so varicocele is classified as an idiopathic disease.\nSome hypotheses about the cause include: venous valve insufficiency, abnormal location of the spermatic vein into the left renal vein or abdominal vena cava. It may be due to causes of increased abdominal pressure such as tumors in the pelvic region, retroperitoneum...\nVaricocele is often caused by blood flowing backward to the lower area (instead of flowing to the heart), similar to varicose veins in the lower limbs. The pathogenesis of varicocele is due to weakening of the venous valve system, leading to blood reflux from the vena cava system into the spermatic vein system, causing dilation of the spermatic plexuses in the spermatic veins. inguinal and scrotal areas. (first)\nThe varicocele plexus dilates, causing blood stagnation, increasing the temperature in the testicles, leading to sperm destruction.\n\nDiagnosis of varicocele\nThe early stages of varicocele often have no clinical manifestations. Most patients are diagnosed when the disease is late, with palpable dilated veins in the scrotum, or clinical symptoms of testicular pain.\nSome patients, when examined for male infertility, accidentally discover varicocele.\nDiagnosis of advanced varicocele is not difficult, using both clinical examination and ultrasound. According to the Dubin classification, varicocele is divided into 5 grades:\nGrade 0: Diagnosed only on ultrasound, angiography, or other diagnostic means but not detected clinically; Grade 1: palpable varicose veins when doing the Valsava test; Grade 2: palpable venous tufts when the patient is in an upright position; Grade 3: visible varicose veins when the patient is in an upright position; Grade 4: easy to see zigzag varicose veins under the scrotal skin whether standing or lying down.\nOn ultrasound, if the diameter of the spermatic vein is greater than 2.5mm, it is considered dilated. According to the Sarteschi classification, there are 5 levels of dilatation on Doppler ultrasound\nGrade 1: No varicocele in the scrotum. There is reflux of the spermatic plexus in the spermatic cord at the inguinal canal when doing the Valsava test.; Grade 2: No varicocele in lying position. In the standing position, there is relaxation and reflux localized at the upper pole of the testicles, when doing the Valsava test.; Grade 3: No varicocele in lying position. Standing position has relaxation and reflux flow spreads to both the upper and lower poles of the testicles, when doing the Valsava test.; Grade 4: The spermatic veins are dilated and there is reflux when doing the Valsava test in the lying position.; Grade 5: The spermatic cord is dilated, there is reflux even without doing the Valsava test\n\nSymptoms of varicocele\nMost of the time, varicocele has no specific symptoms. Occasionally, it can cause mild pain or a feeling of heaviness in the scrotal area. Pain may be worse in the evening, or after standing for a long time, doing strenuous work or sitting a lot. If the varicocele is large, the patient may experience swelling above the scrotum.(2)\n\nDoes varicocele cause testicular atrophy?\nSome experts believe that varicoceles cause testicular atrophy. In fact, in some cases, testicular volume decreased to < 20ml. However, this conclusion is still being researched.\n\nIs varicocele dangerous?\nVaricocele is a common disease in men but is not too dangerous. In fact, up to 15% of adult men have varicocele. Many cases do not pay attention to the disease throughout their lives. The disease may also not cause any problems in the person's life. In adolescents, the incidence of varicocele is 20%. Some can be completely cured without treatment.\n\nCan you have children with varicocele?\nAbout 1 in 10 men have a varicocele. However, many people with varicocele do not have abnormalities in sperm count or fertility problems.(3)\nHowever, 40% of men are infertile due to varicocele.\nThe reason is shown, when the spermatic plexus dilates, causing blood stasis and increasing the temperature in the testicles. This leads to the destruction of the man's sperm.\n\nTreatment of varicocele\nMonitor\nNot every patient with a varicocele needs surgery. If you are not in pain or you have no fertility problems, your doctor will advise you to continue monitoring for a while.\nIf the veins are not enlarged and are not causing you any discomfort, you may not need any further treatment.\nSurgery\nIf the patient has pain in the scrotal area, or if the veins are dilated and unsightly; Or if the couple is having difficulty with fertility, the doctor may advise the patient to have surgery or other procedures for treatment.(4)\nThe doctor will ligate the varicocele above or around the testicles.\nThis is surgery that can return on the same day. Surgery time is less than 1 hour; During surgery, the anesthesiologist will create all conditions for you to feel comfortable and pain-free. You can sleep or not sleep (spinal anesthesia) but there is absolutely no pain.; A small skin incision in the lower abdomen or above the inguinal fold, 2-3 cm long, toÂ  perform the surgery.; 2-3 hours after surgery, you can leave the hospital.\nIt is advisable to have a relative accompany you during surgery, because you will need time to recover from anesthesia or anesthesia.\nNote after surgery\nCan return to work 48 hours after surgery.; Avoid strenuous activities for 48 hours after surgery such as lifting heavy objects or having sex; You can return to normal activities after 5-7 days, including playing sports; You can shower 24 hours after surgery. (do not soak soap in the bathtub within 5 days); Sometimes the incision has slight pain or fluid leakage, little scrotal swelling... You can use cotton or gauze to cover the incision.; After surgery, the doctor will give pain medication. You should take the medication as directed within 48 hours. After that, use medicine only when necessary such as severe pain...; Follow-up examination to check the condition of the surgical wound after 2 weeks.; Three months after surgery, have a semen test and count the number of sperm. (The first test, the sperm count usually does not improve much, but the number will increase in subsequent counts)\nUnwanted consequences may occur\nBleed.; Infection.; Swelling of the scrotum due to fluid collection (hydrocele in the spermatic space).; Recurrent varicocele.; Testicular atrophy.\nSee your doctor immediately if you have the following symptoms\nPersistent pain, not relieved by painkillers; The surgical wound is bruised or dark; Bleeding from the surgical wound; There is a rotten smell from the incision.; The scrotum is swollen; Fever above 380C or with chills.\nDepartment of Andrology, Tam Anh General Hospital System with a team of experts and doctors who are skilled, dedicated, enthusiastic, and confident in mastering the most advanced techniques with the support of machinery and equipment systems. Modern diagnostic imaging equipment such as:\nSomatom Drive 768-slice CT scanner, new generation magnetic resonance machine Magnetom Amira BioMatrix, ultrasound machine; Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss surgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table; Spacious facilities... will help detect early and have effective and quick treatment plans for Varicocele.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of varicocele with leading experts at the Department of Andrology, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nVaricocele is one of the causes of infertility.
