    "content": "Trichinosis: Symptoms, causes, treatment, prevention\n\nTrichinosis is related to the habits and habits of eating blood pudding, rare meat, undercooked meat... The disease is transmitted from animals to humans and there have been deaths. Currently, at least 8 species of trichinosis have been discovered in the world. So what is trichinosis, is trichinosis dangerous, and how to prevent it?\n\nWhat are pinworms?\nTrichinella is a parasite that causes disease in humans with the scientific name Trichinella Spiralis. Currently, the world has recorded 8 species of trichinosis  including: T. spiralis, T. nativa, T. britovi, T. murrelli, T. nelsoni, T. pseudospiralis, T. papure and T. zimbabwensis and 4 genotypes of trichinosis ( genotypes T6, T8, T9, T12).\nTwisted worms not only cause disease in adulthood but also in the larval stage. People get Trichinellosis by eating raw, undercooked meat, mainly pork that contains parasites. Worms cause acute illness and can cause epidemics. People infected with trichinosis will have abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, and body fever; Can even lead to myocarditis and encephalitis. (first)\n\nDevelopment cycle of twisted worms\nAdult pinworms live in the small intestine of humans or some mammals (pigs, dogs, cats, mice, bears...). In some severe cases, roundworms parasitize even the large intestine. (2)\nMale worms are expelled from the body after intercourse with female worms. Meanwhile, female worms continue to burrow deep into the intestinal mucosa and parasitize there. Unlike some other types of parasites, female pinworms do not lay eggs but lay larvae in the intestinal mucosa, sometimes directly into lymph vessels and mesenteric lymph nodes. After 5 days of parasitism, the female worm lays about 1,500 larvae, each larva is about 0.1 mm long. Ultimately, the female dies.\nAfter the next 10-15 days, the larvae are capable of causing disease. The larvae enter the blood through the arterial circulatory system and circulate throughout the body, concentrating mainly in the skeletal muscle system. Skeletal muscle plays an important role in developing and maintaining muscle function. Muscles that larvae can attack include the diaphragm, jaw, tongue, larynx and eyes...\nWhen parasitic in the muscles, the larvae are encased in white cocoons with a size of 250 - 400?m. The larvae in the cocoon curl up like a spring. A cocoon contains at least one larva. Normally, a single larva occupies each muscle fiber. Larvae can live in cocoons for 6 - 24 months.\nAfter 6 - 9 months, the cocoon will gradually calcify. In some cases, the calcification process is delayed, the helminth larvae can survive for several years, even up to 30 - 40 years later.\nHumans and mammals (pigs, dogs, cats, bears, rats, seals, sheep...) eat infected animal meat, and after only 24 hours entering the small intestine,  trichinosis larvae develop into adult worms and capture them. first penetrates the mucosa of the small intestine. Within 24 - 30 hours, the larvae undergo 4 molts in the stomach, become sexually complete and begin a new life cycle.\n\nCause of trichinosis\nHelminths are not transmitted directly from person to person, people get sick by eating animal meat, especially raw, undercooked pork.\nTransmission route of trichinosis: the disease is transmitted through food, especially the habit of eating pig's blood pudding, eating raw pork, eating undercooked meat... infected with trichinic larvae.\n\nWhat diseases do pinworms cause?\nThe world records that each year an estimated 10,000 people get sick. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 1940 there were about 400 cases of the disease but from 2008 to 2010 there were only about 20 cases/year.\nPeople with the disease are mainly hunters and people who eat wild animals. Particularly in Asia, the number of cases recorded is high in China, where pork consumption is the highest in the world. In Vietnam, at least 6 clusters of trichinosis have been discovered, with over 126 people infected and 8 deaths. (3)\nHumans eat undercooked pork contaminated with cocoons containing trichinic larvae. After eating, under the influence of the human body's digestive enzymes, the larvae are released from the cocoon in the stomach and move to the small intestine. Adult worms do not cause serious intestinal disease.\nMost diseases are benign and can be cured after 6 months, but there are some cases that lead to complications such as: myocarditis, arrhythmia, pneumonia, nephritis, chronic diarrhea; even death.\n\nSymptoms of trichinosis infection\nClinical manifestations usually go through 3 periods:\nAdult worms parasitize in the intestine: the patient shows signs of digestive disorders such as abdominal pain and diarrhea for 1-2 days.; Larvae move in the muscles: the patient has high fever, rapid weakness, and pain in the muscles and joints. Difficulty chewing, difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing. There is edema in the face and eyelids; Cystic larvae: the patient is very exhausted, itchy, feels like crawling, insomnia, sweating, face is swollen, skin has petechiae.; If the infection is mild, the disease may gradually subside, fever will decrease, and swelling will go away, but muscle pain may still exist. If severely infected, symptoms of muscle pain, respiratory paralysis, and severe weakness can lead to death\n\nComplications can occur when infected with trichinosis\nPeople infected with trichinosis may experience cardiovascular and neurological complications such as myositis, pneumonia, and encephalitis. In some cases, patients infected with trichinosis larvae leave severe sequelae that can lead to death from heart failure.\n\nFactors that increase the risk of disease\nPeople traveling or living in endemic environments where trichinosis is endemic.\nPeople who have the habit of eating pork blood pudding, undercooked pork, eating salads, undercooked dishes... from undercooked pork have pathogens.\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nThe patient has eaten undercooked pork blood pudding, pork, lamb... and has symptoms such as myocarditis, arrhythmia, fever, eye edema, itchy feeling...\nThe disease is not transmitted from person to person, but outbreaks can occur in the same group of people, community or family that share common eating habits or eat contaminated food. If you discover that someone living around you is sick, you should also see a doctor for timely testing and treatment.\n\nMethods of diagnosing trichinosis infection\nTest: the patient has increased eosinophilia (acidophilic white blood cells), which proves that the patient is at risk of parasitic infection. For people with mild disease, eosinophils increase by 15%-30%; People with severe cases increase by 50%-60%.\nIn addition, the patient needs to have a muscle biopsy and find helminth larvae antibodies in the blood using the Elisa method.\n\nHow to treat trichinosis\nTrichinosis is easily treated with many specific medications such as Praziquantel, Albendazole, Thiabendazole, and can last from 5-7 days. In addition, depending on the symptoms and sequelae left by trichinosis, patients are also given rehydration, electrolytes, fever-reducing drugs, even corticosteroids... to relieve pain and reduce inflammation.\n\nMeasures to prevent trichinosis infection in humans\nDo not eat pork blood pudding, pork, lamb... must be cooked before eating.; Limit the use of smoked meat, hot meat... Because meat is cooked at a temperature of at least 77 degrees Celsius to kill pinworm larvae.; Wild animals live in unsanitary environments, so avoid hunting wild animals that are susceptible to trichinosis.\nTam Anh General Hospital Testing Center meets ISO 15189:2012 standards, continuously investing in the latest generation machinery with leading technology from European and American countries such as: 768-slice CT scanner, 3 Tesla MRI scan, LOGIQ Fortis ultrasound machine, modern 4D echocardiography machine, machines and biological products to test for parasites like trichinosis, gnathostomiasis, roundworms, strongyloides, liver flukes...\nIn particular, the Testing Center, Cardiovascular Center, Medical Examination Department, Dermatology Department, Ophthalmology Department... have leading experts in the field of parasites, helping patients not only get accurate test results early. which ensures the treatment process is highly effective.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at Tam Anh General Hospital Testing Center, you can make an appointment online through the following ways:\nCall the hotline 0287 102 6789 - 093 180 6858 (HCMC) or 024 3872 3872 - 024 7106 6858 (Hanoi) to register for a private medical appointment with a specialist, through the customer service staff.; Register for a medical appointment with any doctor you trust at the link: https://tamanhhospital.vn/danh-cho-khach-hang/dat-lich-kham/; Send a message on Tam Anh General Hospital Fanpage or Tam Anh General Hospital Urology and Andrology Fanpage; Text message via Zalo OA of Tam Anh General Hospital.\nTwisted worms cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, eyelid swelling, edema, severe weakness, and even death, but the disease can be completely prevented by not eating blood pudding or undercooked meat. If the patient has signs of suspected illness or has a family member who is sick, they need to see a doctor, get tested and receive timely treatment.",
