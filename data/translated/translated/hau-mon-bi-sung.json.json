    "content": "Swollen anus: Causes, diagnosis and prevention\n\nA swollen anus is a digestive health problem that is the result of many different causes. A swollen anus will cause a burning and uncomfortable feeling. In some more severe cases, there will be bleeding or pus, accompanied by symptoms of fever and severe pain. This condition is usually benign and will go away after a while. However, this can also be a sign of a dangerous disease that you need to watch out for.\n\nWhat is a swollen anus?\nSwollen anus is a condition in which one or both sides of the anus are swollen, accompanied by a burning sensation that causes discomfort for the patient. This is a disease of the digestive system, caused by a variety of causes, including anal infection. In some recorded cases, the anus is swollen due to other diseases, accompanied by pain in the lower abdomen, and discharge of fluid, blood or pus in the anus.\nThe digestive tract is a system of hollow organs, connected together in a long, curly tube from the mouth to the anus. The gastrointestinal organs include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and anus.\nThe anus is a hollow organ located at the last position of the digestive system, after the rectum. The anus includes the anal canal, anal valves, anal antrum, and anal nipples. The rectum connects to the anus by the anal canal and this is also the way the rectum transfers feces through the anal canal to the anus and out of the body. Inside the anus there are glands, blood vessels, tissues and nerves that are quite sensitive and easily irritated.\nThere are many causes of anal swelling, and the symptoms of anal swelling also depend on each cause. Common symptoms of anal swelling may include:\nOne or both sides of the anus are swollen; Feeling warm or painful when going to the toilet; Burning feeling in the anus; Anal itching; Severe pain appears; Anal discharge, in some cases blood and pus; Fever\nA swollen anus can be the start of a dangerous problem. Most cases of anal swelling have benign symptoms and will go away after a while. However, a swollen anus is also known to be a symptom of related diseases. And in this case, the patient needs to treat the main disease that caused the anal swelling to treat the swelling and prevent the disease from progressing more seriously.\n\nCauses of anal swelling\nA swollen anus can be caused by many different reasons. However, the most common causes come from other anal diseases. Anal swelling is one of the clinical signs that helps patients recognize the state of their digestive health, specifically their anus.(2)\nSome typical diseases with signs of anal swelling include: anal fissures, hemorrhoids, anal abscesses, anal infections,...\n1. Infected anal fissure\nAn anal fissure is a condition in which scratches, tears or ulcers appear at the edge of the anal canal. This is a benign disease but the second most common disease related to the anus, after hemorrhoids. Anal fissures cause burning pain in the anal area, sometimes bleeding due to ulcers in the damaged mucosal area. The disease is common in middle-aged people. In addition, the disease can also be caused by the patient trying to push hard stools, thereby damaging the mucosa at the edge of the anal canal.\nOne of the symptoms of anal fissures is a swollen anus. This symptom appears mainly after the patient defecates. The anus is swollen due to the friction of stool, especially hard stool, with existing tears in the mucosa. Therefore, sometimes patients will also see blood mixed in the stool after defecation.(1)\nIn addition, anal fissures also have other symptoms such as anal itching, cracks or excess skin in the skin around the anus.\nSome causes of anal fissures include:\nHard stools, difficult to eliminate; Diarrhea; Irritable bowel syndrome; The anal sphincter is too tight; There is a tumor in the anal mucosa; Infection\n2. Anal abscess\nAn anal abscess is an infection of the anus with pus. The tissues and nerves in the anus are very sensitive and easily irritated. When the anal glands are blocked, it will lead to anal infection. An anal abscess eventually forms when the infection becomes severe and there is pus around it.\nPeople with anal abscess will clearly feel pain and swelling in the anal area. This is a symptom of a swollen anus caused by an anal abscess. Other clinical signs of an anal abscess include a lump around the anus and fever.\nIf the patient has all of the above symptoms, this is a sign that the infection is quite serious and needs to see a doctor for timely examination and treatment.\nBecause anal abscesses are caused by an infection, people with colitis are considered to be at high risk for anal abscesses and anal swelling.\nA study in the US showed that anal abscesses occur more often in women than men.\n3. Abscessed anal fistula\nAnal fistula is also a form of anal infection but there is a tunnel connecting the infected gland with other skin areas around the anus and anal opening. Anal fistula, also known as eel vascular disease, is often a complication of anal abscess. That means, people with anal abscesses have a high risk of anal fistula if the disease is not treated promptly.\nAnal fistula is not a dangerous disease or seriously affects the patient's life. However, the symptoms of the disease will significantly reduce the patient's quality of life. Symptoms of anal fistula include:\nSwollen anus; Anal stimulation; Pain and itching in the anal area; Leakage of feces through the anus (3)\n4. Swollen anus due to hemorrhoids\nHemorrhoids are a condition in which the veins inside the anus become swollen, causing pain and discomfort for the patient. Hemorrhoids are the most common disease among anal diseases. It is estimated that 1 in 20 Americans will have hemorrhoids, and the disease can happen to people of any age.\nThere are two types of hemorrhoids: internal hemorrhoids and external hemorrhoids. External hemorrhoids are hemorrhoids located below the dentate line and covered by squamous epithelium. Internal hemorrhoids are hemorrhoids located above the dentate line and lined with rectal mucosa. The disease is a consequence of increased pressure in the veins of the anus or rectum. This often happens in people who often carry heavy loads or during pregnancy, but most commonly in people who have a habit of pushing hard when defecating.\nIf hemorrhoids are thrombosed, they will cause pain, the anus will become purple and swollen, and it will be difficult for the patient to clean the anus. Furthermore, hemorrhoids are also the cause of bloody stools and mucus secretion.\n5. Due to inflammation of the anal canal, perianal dermatitis\nAnal inflammation is a phenomenon in which the lining of the anal canal is damaged. This inflammation occurs after the patient consumes too much hot and spicy food, leading to the secretion of a lot of acid in the stomach. Foods such as acid, coffee or food particles left in the excreted stool will collide with the mucosa in the anal canal or anal opening. This causes inflammation of the lining inside the anus.\nAnal inflammation is not a dangerous disease, it causes symptoms of a swollen anus, sometimes with fluid or blood during defecation. However, patients can completely be treated medically with medication.\n6. Crohn's disease\nCrohn's disease is a chronic transmural inflammatory bowel disease. The disease often originates from inflammation of the cavity or abscess, from there progressing to ulcers on the mucosal wall of the anus. There are three types of Crohn's disease: anal inflammation, anal stricture or obstruction, and anal fistula.\nAdditionally, Crohn's disease also affects the ileum and colon. The patient will experience symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, swollen anus, tender abdomen, and may see lumps or masses inside the abdomen. Patients need to treat the disease early to avoid dangerous complications of the disease such as increased risk of small bowel cancer, colorectal cancer or ulcerative colitis.\n7. Anal sex\nAnal sex is an activity that can cause anal swelling. The impact of lovemaking will damage the skin in the anal opening and anal canal. Especially when having sex too vigorously, or using sexual aids, collision with the anal skin will easily cause injuries such as bleeding, scratches, infection or anal rupture. swelling.\n8. Anal cancer\nAnal cancer is a condition in which cancer cells begin to appear in the anus. Based on the location where the cells appear, anal cancer is divided into two groups: anal canal cancer and perianal skin cancer.\nAnal squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of anal cancer. The causes of anal cancer are usually:\nSTDs caused by HPV virus infection; Advanced age; Prolonged anal fistula; The anus often experiences irritation\nAnal cancer causes symptoms such as:\nSwollen or lumpy anus; Bleeding from the anus; Anal canal pain; Bleeding or discharge\n\nDiagnosis of red, swollen anus\nThe doctor will review the patient's clinical symptoms and perform an examination of the patient's anal canal to find previous warts. After having enough clinical information, the doctor will prescribe the appropriate endoscopic method.\n1. Anal examination\nAnoscopy is a method of diagnosing cases where patients have symptoms of a swollen anus but do not have warts or problems in the skin around the anus.\nThe doctor will use an endoscopy tool equipped with a specialized camera to enter the patient's anus and examine the condition of the mucosa, tissues, and nerves inside the anus. Based on the image results, the doctor will make a conclusion about the cause of the patient's anal swelling.\n2. Sigmoidoscopy\nSigmoidoscopy, also known as colonoscopy without biopsy, is a method of directly examining the sigmoid colon. The doctor will insert a flexible scope into the patient's body through the anus. From there, examine the rectum and anus.\nThe method is indicated for cases where the anus is swollen with severe abdominal pain, heavy blood in the stool, and foreign objects in the colon.\nHowever, sigmoidoscopy is not applied to the following subjects:\nPregnant women over 3 months; People with myocardial infarction or cardiovascular diseases; People with colon perforation or peritonitis or unstable colon health\n3. Colonoscopy\nIn colonoscopy, the flexible endoscope used will be longer so it can be inserted deeper into the patient's rectum and colon.\nThis method will be indicated for subjects with symptoms of swollen anus who go to work with suspected signs of abnormal tumors or cancer cells inside the anus.\n4. Ultrasound of the anal cavity: Diagnosis of anal abscess\nAnorectal magnetic resonance imaging with contrast injection: helps diagnose anal abscesses and fistulas that cause swelling around the anus.\n\nTreatment of red, swollen anus\nSwollen anus can be completely treated, and the most effective treatment is to treat the underlying disease, the main cause of anal swelling.\nDepending on each patient's clinical signs and anal pathology, the doctor will recommend appropriate treatment regimens.\nCommon ways to treat swollen anus for each type of disease include:\nAnal inflammation: Use stool softeners, anti-inflammatory drugs or antibiotics. Combined with a frugal diet, minimize foods that cause digestive irritation and increase fiber in each serving. In addition, patients can also use topical medications that reduce swelling such as Hydrocortisone; Anal inflammation: Use stool softeners, anti-inflammatory drugs or antibiotics. Combined with a frugal diet, minimize foods that cause digestive irritation and increase fiber in each serving. In addition, patients can also use topical medications that reduce swelling such as Hydrocortisone.\nAnal fissures: If the patient does not have excess skin or tumors, they can be treated by injecting Botulinum Toxin A into the internal sphincter or the location of the fissure. In cases of severe anal fissures, the doctor will perform surgery to cut the internal anal sphincter. The success rate of this surgery is 98%; Anal fissures: If the patient does not have excess skin or tumors, they can be treated by injecting Botulinum Toxin A into the internal sphincter or the location of the fissure. In cases of severe anal fissures, the doctor will perform surgery to cut the internal anal sphincter.

Depending on the condition of hemorrhoids and the patient's needs, the doctor will perform treatment. Some methods to treat hemorrhoids include topical medications, laser burning, sclerotherapy, elastic ligation procedures, hair surgery or doppler; Hemorrhoids: There are many methods to treat hemorrhoids. Depending on the condition of hemorrhoids and the patient's needs, the doctor will perform treatment. Some methods to treat hemorrhoids include topical medications, laser ablation, sclerotherapy, elastic ligation procedures, hair surgery or doppler.\nAnal abscess: With anal abscess, the doctor will perform surgical drainage to effectively treat infection and pus. In addition, patients also need to take antibiotics to minimize the risk of other underlying diseases such as diabetes or weakened immune system; Anal abscess: With anal abscess, the doctor will perform surgical drainage to effectively treat infection and pus.
