    "content": "Phimosis: Symptoms and treatment\n\nCurrently, foreskin stenosis accounts for a high proportion of cases consulting a physician. This has become a big concern for many parents. This article summarizes all the information about signs of phimosis and how to resolve this concern.\n\nWhat is phimosis?\nPhimosis is a condition in which the foreskin cannot be completely retracted from the glans. Currently, phimosis is often diagnosed easily, because it is not possible to distinguish between physiological phimosis and pathological phimosis. (first)\nPhysiological phimosis: The foreskin does not retract during normal physiological development; Pathological phimosis: This is a case caused by diseases such as keratosis causing foreskin atrophy, fibrosing leukoplakia balanitis, scarring from using force to pull the foreskin up before...\n80% of phimosis cases can resolve on their own as they grow older and do not require treatment before the age of six. In these cases, the foreskin is considered normal, also known as physiological phimosis. At an older age, if the foreskin is still narrow, that is, true or pathological, it needs to be treated.\nOccasionally, there are some cases of foreskin stenosis. At that time, the foreskin slides up over the glans with difficulty and becomes clogged, unable to return to its normal position. The foreskin forms a tight ring around the glans, causing the foreskin to swell and be very painful. In this case, the patient needs to be treated immediately, otherwise it will cause necrosis or other serious complications.\n\nFunction of the foreskin\nThe foreskin, with an outer surface of skin and an inner surface of mucosa, surrounds and protects the glans (head of the penis). The foreskin protects the glans and keeps it soft, warm, moist, and sensitive.\nThe glans mucosa has glands that secrete mucus, which when accumulated will create a white layer of genital sebum between the glans and the foreskin. The foreskin is sensitive to sexual stimulation and is necessary for normal sexual activity.\nThe penis and glans are naturally clean. However, the penis is also a place where outside bacteria can enter the body, especially during intercourse.\n\nSigns of phimosis\nIn children, the foreskin is often firmly attached to the glans. Rarely, the foreskin can slip back. “The foreskin does not retract back” can be considered normal in men, even in adulthood.\nAbout 50% of cases occur in 1-year-old children, 90% of 3-year-old children and 99% of 17-year-old children can retract the foreskin easily and normally.\nIn many parts of the world, it is customary to remove the foreskin of children at birth or at puberty. Ancient Egyptian drawings show that circumcision was practiced thousands of years ago.\nIn adults: At puberty, the penis grows rapidly, gets bigger and longer, and the glans will slide out of the foreskin. In about 95% of cases of 16-17 year old children, the foreskin can completely retract.\n\nConsequences of phimosis\nNarrow foreskin causes urine to stagnate, making hygiene difficult, easily causing infections of the glans, foreskin, urinary tract, and affecting the kidneys. In this case, the foreskin slides up but cannot return to its normal position, forming a constriction that will tighten the glans, causing the foreskin to swell and cause pain, called foreskin stenosis. This is an emergency that requires immediate intervention.\nForeskin stenosis can lead to penile cancer... In addition, in adulthood, foreskin stenosis can cause pain in the penis when erect, hindering the erection process.\n\nWhen should the foreskin be circumcised?\nIn children under 6 years old, phimosis is often physiological and only needs treatment when it causes urinary tract obstruction or infection, etc. About 90% of children after 3 years old can easily lose their foreskin. Do not try to remove the foreskin early to avoid pain, bleeding or possibly sticking the glans to the foreskin and scarring the foreskin, causing secondary foreskin narrowing.\nIn older children or adults, phimosis needs to be distinguished from a short frenulum (although the two conditions often go together). Foreskin stenosis in older children and adults, if there is no serious problem, non-surgical methods can be used.\n\nDiagnosis of phimosis\nSome current views on classifying phimosis:\nIn terms of degree, phimosis is classified as: relative phimosis (the foreskin can be partially retracted) and complete phimosis (the foreskin cannot be retracted at all).\nAccording to Meuli et al., phimosis is divided into 4 levels, specifically:\nLevel 1: The foreskin can be completely retracted but is difficult and has a ring around the shaft of the penis.; Level 2: The foreskin is partially pulled up to reveal the head of the penis; Level 3: The foreskin can be pulled up a little, only revealing the opening; Level 4: The foreskin cannot be retracted at all.\n\nTreatment of phimosis\nModern views of phimosis treatment are changing a lot. Currently, many experts believe that the foreskin has its own physiological function. Therefore, there are many recommendations not to perform circumcision as widely as before. (2)\nIn addition, modern opinion believes that phimosis in children is a normal physiological phenomenon, and many recommend avoiding unnecessary interventions. Phimosis in children is completely different from phimosis in adults.\nParents should once again understand that most cases of phimosis in children are normal physiology. The condition will stabilize on its own as the child matures. Parents only need to pay attention to daily hygiene and bathing for children. In older children or adults, phimosis needs to be distinguished from a short frenum (although these two conditions often go together).\nPhimosis can be treated with the following non-surgical and surgical methods:\nUse steroid cream (0.1% betamethasone) for 4 – 6 weeks. This method is easy to apply, low cost, low risk, and highly effective compared to surgery.; Dilate the foreskin by hand, with a balloon or other device. Initially, the doctor does it, but later the family can do it for the child. This method has the advantage of being gentle and not causing trauma. However, if improperly dilated, it can cause bleeding and adhesions later.\nIf the medication is not effective, the foreskin is still narrow, bulges when urinating, or has frequent balanitis or urinary tract infections, the patient should have circumcision surgery.\nForeskin shaping; Circumcision is the surgical removal of part or all of the foreskin.\n\nIn what cases is circumcision performed?\nCircumcision is recommended in cases such as: phimosis, balanitis or recurrent balanitis or for personal reasons.\nIn addition, men should not be circumcised in cases such as: low urinary opening, penile deformities such as curved penis, buried penis, small penis because the patient needs to use the foreskin to shape it. correct these deformities.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n1/ Can you get pregnant with phimosis?\nSevere phimosis can affect men's sex life:\nInflammation, swelling, pain: Patients with phimosis often face the risk of infection. A common case is inflammation of the foreskin and balanitis. The inner surface of the thin skin covering the outside of the glans always secretes sebum and dead cells. Therefore, phimosis will make it difficult for men to clean their penis. In addition, a narrow foreskin also prevents urine from escaping completely, remaining inside the foreskin, gradually accumulating into dirty residue. This is a favorable condition for bacteria and fungi to multiply and develop, causing inflammation, swelling and pain. This condition seriously affects not only health but also causes pain and affects sex life.; Pain in the penis when erect and having sex: Patients with phimosis may experience pain when the penis is erect or during sex.; Foreskin stenosis: In severe cases, the foreskin is too narrow, causing blood in the foreskin to not circulate, causing swelling and pain.\n2/ Where should I be examined for phimosis?\nWhen treating phimosis at Tam Anh General Hospital system, patients will experience 5-star examination, diagnosis and treatment services. The patient had surgery and was discharged the same day.\nThe wound usually heals after 1 week and does not require suture removal. During that time, patients can change bandages at Tam Anh General Hospital system or other medical facilities according to the instructions of doctors.\nDepartment of Andrology, Tam Anh General Hospital System with a team of experts and doctors who are skilled, dedicated, enthusiastic, and confident in mastering the most advanced techniques with the support of machinery and equipment systems. Modern diagnostic imaging equipment with Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss microsurgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table; Spacious facilities... will help detect early and have a safe and effective treatment plan for phimosis.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Department of Andrology, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nPhimosis needs to be treated promptly to minimize inflammation and problems during sexual intercourse. Whether this condition is due to congenital or objective factors, men should still see a doctor to have the necessary procedures performed.",
