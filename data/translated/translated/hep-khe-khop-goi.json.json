    "content": "Knee joint space stenosis: Causes, signs, diagnosis and treatment\n\nKnee joint space narrowing is a typical sign of many serious medical problems, directly hindering mobility and daily activities. If not treated promptly, this condition can lead to many dangerous complications, even disability. Therefore, the monitoring process for early detection and treatment is really important.\n\nWhat is knee joint space stenosis?\nKnee joint space narrowing is a condition in which the cartilage wears away over time, causing the space inside the joint to become smaller. From there, the movement process becomes difficult, often causing pain and stiffness, even loss of mobility or disability. (first)\nSpecifically, for a healthy knee joint, there is always enough space between the femur, tibia and patella, ensuring flexible joint movement. However, if severe injury or degeneration occurs, the cartilage surface that covers the ends of the bones will wear away. This is the reason why the knee joint space narrows, causing friction between cartilage tissue to increase during movement, leading to common pain.\n\nGrading of knee joint stenosis\nThe degree of knee joint space narrowing is assessed based on the degree of osteoarthritis. Specifically, the Kellgren â€“ Lawrence scale is used as follows:\n0: The joint space shows no signs of abnormality.; 1: An abnormal change appears in the joint space.; 2: The joint space changes insignificantly, bone spurs appear.; 3: Joint space changes moderately with many bone spurs, accompanied by joint space narrowing; 4: The joint space changes seriously with significant narrowing, large bone spurs appear, and the bone ends are clearly deformed.\n\nSigns of narrowing of the knee joint space\nKnee joint stenosis can be easily recognized through a number of clear symptoms as follows: (2)\nJoint pain: The pain appears dull, gradually increases when moving or changing positions and tends to decrease with adequate rest.; Limited mobility: Joint space narrowing occurs due to sloughing of joint cartilage, increasing friction between bone ends, leading to limited mobility, especially when going up and down stairs or sitting. squat or change position suddenly; Deformed knee joint: The knee joint can be deformed due to narrowing of the joint space and bone spurs.; Joints are stiff in the morning, unable to move and this symptom usually disappears within 30 minutes.; Strange sounds appear when moving the knee joint.; Large knee joint spurs appear easily.; Muscles around the knee joint show signs of atrophy due to limited movement.\n\nCause of narrow knee joint space\nKnee stenosis often results from loss of articular cartilage in the knee bones. In addition, some injuries related to the meniscus or anterior cruciate ligament tears have also been shown to have similar effects.\nRisk factor\nAge: The older you are, the more easily the cartilage degenerates, leading to narrowing of the joint space.; Injuries: Injuries from traffic accidents, sports accidents or excessive, repetitive movements can cause permanent joint damage and degeneration.; Overweight: This condition causes stress and puts excessive pressure on the joints, which in the long term can easily lead to degeneration.\n\nComplications of knee joint space narrowing\nIn many cases, narrowing of the knee joint space can be an early sign of arthritis, the most common of which is rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, if this condition is not treated promptly, there is a risk of leading to many serious complications as follows: (3)\nBleeding near the joint; Osteonecrosis of the knee.; Knees lose mobility.\n\nDiagnostic method\nFor narrow knee joints, the doctor will initially conduct a physical examination, learn about medical history, injuries, location, level of pain, etc. After that, the joint palpation will also be performed. may be done to test flexibility and discomfort with movement. Next, the doctor will prescribe a number of imaging diagnostic methods to reach the most accurate conclusions, including:\n1. Take X-rays\nThis is often the first method prescribed for knee joint stenosis. X-rays of the knee joint will help doctors identify many important issues such as:\nThe degree of knee joint narrowing, the possibility of progression of arthritis.; Abnormal signs of the knee joint, joint misalignment, ability to connect bones.; Appearance of bone spurs.; Signs of injury and fracture (if any): tibial plateau fracture, patella fracture...; Signs of soft tissue swelling; Existence of excess fluid in the knee.; Detailed lesions related to bones (bone disorders, osteoporosis), bone density.\nX-ray results are usually available within just a few minutes of the procedure. This is one of the reasons why this method is commonly used in diagnosing knee stenosis.\n2. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive, painless test that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to collect two- or three-dimensional images of the structures inside the knee. Through this method, doctors can observe details of tissues, joints and bones, thereby helping to make more accurate conclusions about knee joint space narrowing. In particular, this is a test that is often ordered when it is suspected that damage comes from a cause other than arthritis.\n3. Ultrasound\nWith this method, the doctor will apply a layer of gel to the knee joint area to be examined, then use a probe to transmit sound waves into the body. From there, images of the internal structures will be simulated in detail, helping to support a more accurate diagnosis of joint space narrowing. Ultrasound is usually performed quickly and painlessly. However, when the probe moves, it may cause discomfort to the damaged joint area.\n\nHow to treat narrowing of the knee joint space\nDepending on the condition of knee joint stenosis, the doctor will prescribe appropriate treatment methods, including: (4)\n1. Non-drug treatment\nFor most cases of knee stenosis, the doctor will advise the patient to lose weight if necessary. This helps reduce pressure on the joints, which can lead to significant improvement.\nIn addition, physical therapy is also the preferred treatment option. Among them, hydrotherapy (performed in water environment) is being widely applied because it shows positive effects. This is the optimal method for cases of severe arthritis who are unable to function in a normal environment due to pain.\nAccordingly, the water environment can reduce or eliminate gravity combined with warmth to help relax muscles, creating a more comfortable feeling during treatment. In addition, hydrostatic pressure acting on the body also has the effect of reducing edema and swelling. Therefore, the knee joint will function more effectively without having to be affected by weight and gravity.\n2. Medical treatment\nPain relievers: Commonly used drugs in this treatment regimen include Codeine, Acetaminophen, Aspirin, Codeine, Oxycodone, Hydrocodone... The main mechanism of action is to focus on changing the brain's perception of pain. , does not attack the pain cycle directly.; Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Compared to conventional pain relievers, NSAIDs work by a completely new mechanism, specifically focusing on blocking the effects of the Cyclooxygenase enzyme.\n3. Treatment according to pathogenesis\nSteroid injection: This method is a local approach to treating symptoms of knee joint space narrowing. Among them, Coritsone is often preferred because of its strong anti-inflammatory ability. Specifically, the doctor will inject directly into the knee joint to increase absorption efficiency, help reduce pain and improve mobility.; Knee lubricant injection: A gel-like substance is injected into the knee joint to lubricate and relieve pain. The main ingredient in these injectables is usually Hyaluronic Acid. This is a substance found in joint fluid, but when inflammation occurs, the content is reduced, affecting viscosity and consistency. Depending on each case, the doctor will prescribe the patient a single injection or once a week, continuously for many weeks.\n4. Surgical treatment\nSurgery will be indicated when medical treatments do not bring about effective improvement. This is the optimal choice to prevent serious long-term complications, especially when knee stenosis comes from arthritis. Some surgical methods that may be indicated include:\nKnee arthroscopy: This is a minimally invasive procedure, the doctor can observe detailed damage inside the knee joint to perform treatment.; Knee replacement: Joint replacement is indicated in cases where knee stenosis has progressed to a serious level that cannot be treated with endoscopy. Accordingly, this method will help regenerate the surface of the femur and shin bones by implanting artificial materials. Since then, pain symptoms and mobility have improved significantly.\n\nPrecautions\nIn many cases, knee joint space narrowing cannot be prevented, especially when it is an early sign of arthritis. However, some positive lifestyle changes will help limit damage, enhance joint function and effectively reduce pain:\nBuild a healthy menu, including foods that are good for joints such as: fish rich in Omega-3 fatty acids (salmon, mackerel...), cruciferous vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli...), beans (lentils, green beans...), vegetable oils (olive oil, sunflower oil...)...; Manage your weight appropriately to reduce stress on your knee joints and prevent unwanted injuries.; Exercise regularly, choose appropriate exercises (biking, swimming...).; Regularly stretch the knee joint to avoid excessive tension; Use shoes of appropriate size to avoid knee damage and degeneration.; Actively protect your knee joints by maintaining correct posture, do not lift heavy objects or perform repetitive movements that cause stress and pressure on the joints.; Proactively contact your doctor immediately if any injury related to the knee joint occurs.\nCenter for Orthopedic Trauma, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is where a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons gather such as: TTND.Prof.Dr.Nguyen Viet Tien; Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa; Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh; MSc.BS.CKII Tran Anh Vu; BS.CKI Tran Xuan Anh, MSc.CKI Le Dinh Khoa, PhD.Do Tien Dung; Dr. BS.CKII Vu Huu Dung... This is also one of the pioneer units in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal diseases with modern techniques according to updated international protocols.\nThe hospital is also equipped with modern machinery and imaging equipment such as: Somatom Drive 768-slice CT scanner, new generation Magnetom Amira BioMatrix magnetic resonance machine, Artis Pheno robot, densitometer. bones, ultrasound machines...; Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss surgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table... to be able to detect injuries early and effectively treat musculoskeletal diseases...\nTam Anh General Hospital also owns a spacious clinic system and high-class boarding area; modern rehabilitation area; Comprehensive post-operative care process helps patients quickly recover and stabilize their health after surgery.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Orthopedics Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nAbove is a summary of detailed information related to knee joint space narrowing.
