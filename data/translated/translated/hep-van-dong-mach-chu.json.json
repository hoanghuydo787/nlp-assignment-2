    "content": "Aortic valve stenosis: Symptoms, causes and treatments\n\nAortic valve stenosis impedes the circulation of blood containing oxygen and nutrients to organs in the body. This is a common heart valve disease that can cause many dangerous complications if not detected and treated promptly.\n\nWhat is aortic valve stenosis?\nAortic valve stenosis is a condition in which the valve cannot open completely. This condition will reduce or block blood flow from the heart (left ventricle) to the body. Initially, the heart will work harder to compensate for the lack of blood flow to the organs in the body. However, at some point, the heart will be overworked, leading to left ventricular myocardial hypertrophy or heart failure. (first)\nAortic valve stenosis is divided into three levels: mild, moderate, and severe stenosis. The greater the degree of aortic valve stenosis, the greater the risk of heart failure.\n\nSymptoms of aortic valve stenosis\nWhen aortic valve stenosis is mild, the patient often does not feel any symptoms. Sometimes symptoms only appear faintly during strenuous activities such as playing sports or giving birth...\nWhen the aortic valve is severely narrowed, some typical signs occur with exertion, including:\nChest pain; Shortness of breath; Fatigue, lightheadedness or fainting; Possible arrhythmias:  nervousness; When there are functional symptoms, progression to death is rapid: when chest pain occurs, the average survival is 5 years, syncope is 3 years, and heart failure is only 2 years.\n\nCauses of aortic valve stenosis\nSome common causes of aortic valve stenosis include: (2)\nCalcium degeneration in the elderly (common in the age of 70-80 years): The older you are, the greater the risk of calcification of the aortic valve, cholesterol plaques build up in the heart valves leading to many heart problems. vessels, including aortic valve stenosis; Congenital heart defects: Normally the aortic valve has 3 pieces. In children with congenital aortic valve stenosis, from birth, the valve has only 2 pieces, a 1-piece valve, and even a 4-piece valve, but rarely... Over time, the aortic valve in children with congenital defects often degenerates and becomes calcified. mature earlier than normal people.; Rheumatoid arthritis (a complication of sore throat, causing damage to the heart valve): This is an autoimmune disease caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. The disease usually begins with sore throat, lasting about 2 hours. weeks, depending on the health status of each patient. During this time, the body produces its own antibodies to fight the infection. However, because the structure of heart muscles and valves is similar to bacterial cells, the body's immune barrier makes mistakes and attacks, causing damage to the heart valves.\n\nRisk factors for aortic valve stenosis\nAortic valve stenosis can happen to anyone. However, there are still some subjects at high risk of aortic valve stenosis, including:\nOld age;; Some heart conditions are present at birth (congenital heart disease) such as bicuspid aortic valve;; Have a history of infections that can affect the heart;; There are cardiovascular risk factors: diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure;; Chronic kidney disease;; History of chest radiotherapy.\n\nDangerous complications of aortic valve stenosis\nAortic valve stenosis is one of the most dangerous heart valve diseases. The disease can lead to many dangerous complications such as:\nHeart failure.; Endocarditis; Arrhythmia; Stroke; Blood clot; Dead\n\nPreventive measures for aortic valve stenosis\nTo prevent aortic valve stenosis, you need to proactively have regular health checkups every 6 months so that your doctor can monitor and detect aortic valve stenosis, or other heart diseases in the early stages. before the disease progresses. (3)\nNote, some conditions can cause aortic valve stenosis such as:\nRheumatic fever: see a doctor if your child has a sore throat. Sore throat can lead to rheumatic fever if left untreated. Strep throat can be cured if antibiotics are used properly; Address risk factors for coronary heart disease: including diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and high cholesterol. These factors may be associated with aortic valve stenosis, so you should control your weight, blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels if you have aortic valve stenosis.; Take care of your teeth and gums. Infected gums (gingivitis) and infected heart tissue (endocarditis) are closely related.\n\nDiagnosis method of aortic valve stenosis\nTo diagnose aortic valve stenosis, the doctor will ask about your symptoms, medical history and family history, conduct an examination, listen to the heart and do paraclinical tests to diagnose the disease, determine the cause and determine the cause. severity of aortic valve stenosis.\nSubclinical\nEchocardiography: helps examine the valves and aorta, can determine the cause and extent of the disease, as well as detect other heart valve diseases.; Transesophageal echocardiography helps examine the aortic valve more closely.; Electrocardiogram: can detect thickening, dilation of the heart chambers, arrhythmia...; Chest X-ray: checks whether the heart or aorta is dilated and the condition of the lungs.; Stress test: to see if symptoms of aortic valve disease appear during physical activity and to help determine the condition. If a patient with severe aortic valve stenosis has symptoms,  they should absolutely not do an exercise test; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT scan of the heart: gives detailed images of the heart, including the valves and aorta.; Cardiac catheterization: may be applied if other clinical tests cannot diagnose or determine the severity of the disease.\n\nTreatment of aortic valve stenosis\nTreatment methods for aortic valve stenosis depend on each patient's condition. (4)\nIf symptoms are absent or mild, regular monitoring is required. Your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes, preventing infections in the heart, and medications to treat symptoms or reduce the risk of complications. When the disease is severe, aortic valve replacement surgery is needed as recommended; In some cases, the doctor will replace the aortic valve percutaneously.\nSurgery\nAortic valve replacement: is the main treatment method for severe aortic valve stenosis. The doctor will replace the diseased valve with a mechanical valve or biological valve (made from cow, pig or human heart tissue or using the patient's own pulmonary valve); Biological valves will degrade over time and may need to be replaced. People with mechanical valves must take blood thinners for life to prevent blood clots. The doctor will discuss with the patient the benefits and risks of each type of valve and choose the appropriate valve.; In some cases, your doctor will replace the valve through a catheter without surgery.\nLeft image: Biological aortic valve replacement; Right image: mechanical aortic valve replacement\nChange your lifestyle and self-care regimen at home\nPatients need to have regular follow-up visits to be monitored by a doctor. Besides, although lifestyle changes do not prevent or treat disease, a healthy lifestyle is very beneficial for the heart:\nHeart-healthy diet: eat a variety of fruits and vegetables, low-fat or fat-free dairy products, poultry, fish and whole grains. Avoid saturated fats and trans fats, limit intake of salt and sugar.; Maintain a reasonable weight.; Get regular physical activity. Ask your doctor for guidance before starting to exercise, especially if you are considering competitive sports.; Stress management: through relaxation activities, meditation, physical activity and spending time with family and friends.; Avoid tobacco.; Blood pressure control.; Women of childbearing age with heart valve stenosis: must discuss carefully with the doctor before getting pregnant, about what medications can be used safely, whether any treatment is needed before pregnancy... The patient needs to see a Cardiologist and obstetricians coordinate closely during pregnancy and childbirth. If your valve stenosis is too severe, your doctor may recommend not getting pregnant to avoid the risk of complications.\nSee more: Treatment methods for mitral valve stenosis are being applied today\n\nWhat do you need to prepare before going to the doctor?\nWrite down your symptoms, how long have you had them, how frequent are the symptoms? How severe are the symptoms? What seems to improve or worsen symptoms? Does anyone in your family have heart disease?; Make a list of your important medical information, including any other recent health problems you have had as well as all medications and supplements you are taking.; Bring relatives and friends with you because they can help you remember what the doctor says.\nAortic valve stenosis can lead to many dangerous complications, seriously affecting the patient's health and quality of life. Therefore, each person needs to be aware of disease prevention and have regular check-ups with a Cardiologist to receive appropriate treatment.
