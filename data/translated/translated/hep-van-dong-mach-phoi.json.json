    "content": "Pulmonary valve stenosis: Causes, signs and treatments\n\nPulmonary valve stenosis is a condition in which the pulmonary valve deforms and narrows, causing the flow of blood from the heart to the lungs to be obstructed, causing the patient to have difficulty breathing during exertion, chest pain, fatigue, fainting, loss of consciousness. According to Prof. Dr. Ngo Quy Chau, in all types of congenital heart diseases, pulmonary valve stenosis accounts for 8 - 12%. Mild disease often has no symptoms and can be cured with medication. However, moderate and severe cases should be considered for surgery. Fortunately, the success rate when treating these conditions is usually very high. (first)\n\nWhat is pulmonary valve stenosis?\nPulmonary Valve Stenosis is a condition in which the pulmonary valve does not open properly or wide enough, causing blood flow to slow. Most cases of pulmonary stenosis are congenital.\nThe pulmonary valve is located between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary valve acts like a door, allowing blood to flow in and out of the heart.\n\nCommon symptoms\nPulmonary valve stenosis affects the body's ability to supply oxygen to the blood. Many children are born with this disease, but do not show any symptoms until adulthood. Common symptoms include:\nShortness of breath; Abnormal sounds such as heart murmurs (heard with a stethoscope); Chest pain; Faint; Heart beats fast; Pale skin; Fatigue of unknown cause\nChest pain is a common symptom when the pulmonary valve is narrowed\nPulmonary stenosis can cause sudden death in severe cases. That is why early diagnosis and timely treatment are so important for the patient's health. Because in many patients, signs may not appear until the condition becomes more serious.\n\nCause of pulmonary valve stenosis\nThe disease often occurs when the pulmonary valve does not develop properly during fetal development. Children with this condition are also at risk of other congenital heart diseases. Therefore, if a child is diagnosed with pulmonary valve stenosis, the doctor will recommend that the child undergo additional clinical tests to detect risks to the heart early.\nAdults can also experience this condition due to complications of other diseases. Diseases that are at risk of leading to pulmonary valve narrowing are:\nCarcinoid syndrome: results from the release of a chemical – serotonin – from carcinoid tumors in the digestive system. People with this syndrome will have red skin and diarrhea. (2); Rheumatism: People with rheumatism have infections caused by streptococcus bacteria, such as strep throat, which can damage the heart valves.; Noonan syndrome: This is a genetic disorder that causes patients to have slow physical development, abnormal facial features, and heart defects.\n\nDiagnosis method of pulmonary artery stenosis\nProf. Dr. Ngo Guizhou said that pulmonary valve stenosis can cause abnormal heart sounds. If you use a stethoscope to clearly hear a heart murmur that sounds like a clicking or hissing sound, it may be an early sign of the disease.\nAfter the initial examination, your doctor may ask you to perform some paraclinical tests to observe the anatomical structure of the heart. These imaging diagnoses include:\nChest X-ray; Electrocardiogram (ECG); Echocardiography; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nThe results obtained from diagnostic imaging will help your doctor accurately conclude the condition of your pulmonary valve \n\nPotential complications of disease\nIf not detected and intervened promptly, pulmonary valve stenosis can lead to dangerous complications (3) such as:\nInfection: People with heart valve problems, such as pulmonary stenosis, have a higher risk of getting a bacterial infection of the endocardium (infectious endocarditis) than people without valve problems heart.; Blood pumping problems: When pulmonary valve stenosis progresses to a severe stage, the right ventricle of the heart must pump harder to push blood into the pulmonary artery. At this time, the right ventricle's task of pumping blood is to counteract the increase in pressure, causing the muscular wall of the ventricle to thicken (right ventricular hypertrophy). This phenomenon will cause the heart to become stiff and gradually weaken.; Heart failure: If the right ventricle cannot pump blood effectively, heart failure will develop, manifested by a series of signs such as swelling of the legs and abdomen, fatigue, difficulty breathing...; Irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia): People with pulmonary valve stenosis are prone to having irregular heart rhythms. This complication is usually not life-threatening, unless the pulmonary valve stenosis is severe.\n\nTreatment methods for pulmonary artery stenosis\nThe doctor will base on the clinical examination and results obtained from paraclinical tests to provide a treatment regimen. The disease is in a mild stage, with no specific symptoms and often requires no medical intervention. But if you have “visits” of chest pain, shortness of breath, or fainting spells, your pulmonary valve stenosis is progressing and needs treatment. (4)\nYour doctor may prescribe medication to help blood circulate more easily. These are drugs that have the following effects:\nImprove blood flow;; Thins the blood to reduce blood clotting;; Reduces excess fluid in the blood;; Prevent irregular heartbeat\nAlong with medication, your doctor may prescribe plastic surgery to stretch the pulmonary valve wall to improve blood flow. In severe cases, the patient may need to have the pulmonary valve replaced. The doctor will consider replacing the damaged valve with a mechanical valve or biological valve.\n\nHow to prevent pulmonary valve stenosis\nA healthy diet with lots of green vegetables and fruits helps prevent cardiovascular diseases, including pulmonary valve stenosis\nAlthough the majority of cases of pulmonary valve stenosis are congenital, to prevent the disease caused by other causes, you should adhere to the following: (5)\nDon't let rheumatic fever happen: If sore throat is not treated thoroughly, it can turn into rheumatic fever - a root cause of the disease. Therefore, when you have signs of a sore throat, you should not arbitrarily buy medicine but see a doctor immediately.; Address risk factors for coronary heart disease, including high blood pressure, obesity and high cholesterol levels. These factors are associated with pulmonary valve stenosis. Therefore, you need to control your weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels to prevent pulmonary valve stenosis.; Teeth and gum care: Experts have found a link between infected gums (gingivitis) and infected heart tissue (endocarditis). Inflammation of heart tissue due to infection can narrow the arteries and worsen pulmonary valve stenosis.; Lifestyle changes: Stay away from tobacco, exercise regularly, follow a diet rich in fruits, grains and green vegetables.; If you have a relative (parent, sibling) with heart disease, you need to have your heart health checked every 6 months. This will help doctors screen and detect diseases early, thereby providing timely intervention.\nFor advice and to schedule an examination for respiratory diseases at the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Tam Anh General Hospital, you can contact:\n108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Bo De Ward, Long Bien District, Hanoi City\nHotline: 024 3872 3872 – 024 7106 6858\n2B Pho Quang, Ward 2, Tan Binh District, Ho Chi Minh City\nHotline: 0287 102 6789 – 093 180 6858\nFanpage: https://www.facebook.com/benhvientamanh\nPeople with pulmonary valve stenosis can live healthy lives if they control the disease well and have regular health checks to detect early signs of disease progression for timely and proper intervention.",
