    "content": "What is Herpes? Common causes and symptoms\n\nHerpes is the name of a strain of virus that is transmitted through direct contact and causes skin diseases; The virus has an affinity for the skin and nerves. The Herpes virus family has several types that commonly cause disease in humans, including: Herpes simplex (HSV) causes herpes, Herpes zoster (also known as Varicella zoster virus) causes shingles and chickenpox. According to World Health Organization statistics, an estimated 3.7 billion people under the age of 50 (67%) are infected with HSV-1, and 491 million people aged 15–49 (13%) are infected with HSV- 2 globally. What are the common causes and symptoms of Herpes? The article below helps with prevention, early detection, and effective treatment.\n\nWhat is Herpes simplex?\nHerpes simplex virus – symbol HSV; is a strain of virus that causes skin herpes, commonly found in the mouth and genitals, less commonly on the trunk or limbs. (first)\nMany people live with HSV for years without experiencing symptoms. This means that the person has been infected with the virus for a long time but has never had a herpes outbreak.\nIn the vast majority of cases, people infected with the Herpes virus have blisters on the lips, around the mouth and on the genitals. Herpes can also appear on the fingers, hands and some other parts of the body of people infected with the Herpes virus.\nHerpes simplex virus is a strain of virus that causes skin herpes\nSexual contact is one of the common routes of HSV transmission, but not the only one. Herpes virus can still spread from person to person through many methods. Herpes is a relatively common disease, people with Herpes should not feel ashamed of their condition.\nThe World Health Organization estimates:\nAbout 67% of the world's population under 50 years of age has oral or genital HSV-1.; About 13% of people between the ages of 15 and 49 have HSV-2.\nSeveral other studies show that more than 90% of adults have HSV-1 antibodies by age 50. (2)\n\nDifference between HSV-1 and HSV-2\nThere are two main types of Herpes simplex virus: HSV-1 and HSV-2.\nHSV-1. This type mainly causes oral herpes, characterized by cold sores that appear on the lips, around the mouth or on the patient's face.; HSV-2. This type mainly causes genital herpes, which appears on or around a person's genitals, anus, buttocks, and inner thighs. These blisters can also appear inside the vagina.\nIt's important for patients to note: While HSV-1 is often associated with cold sores (sores on or around the lip area) and HSV-2 is often associated with genital herpes, both are contagious. through oral or genital contact. Thus, both HSV-1 and HSV-2 viruses can be the cause of oral and genital herpes outbreaks.\nBoth viruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2, can cause outbreaks of oral and genital herpes.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of Herpes?\nHSV does not always cause symptoms. Any symptoms noticed and their severity often depend on whether the patient is in the primary or recurrent stages.\n1. Primary\nThe primary stage of Herpes disease occurs from a few days to a few weeks after the patient comes into contact with the source of infection. Symptoms at this stage are similar to those of the flu, including:\nSwollen lymph nodes.; Headache, body aches; Tired.; Fever.; Anorexia.; The patient notices tingling, burning, and small blisters in some areas of the body. The blisters can grow in clusters or spread into patches. These blisters will burst and crust over after a while.\nNote:\nIt can take patients about 6 weeks to completely heal the blisters that appear in the primary stage. Before completely healing, these blisters can still transmit the virus to others.; The blisters cause pain and itching in the area where they appear. Herpes in the genitals causes a sharp pain when the patient urinates.\n2. Recurrence\nSome people infected with the Herpes virus have only one outbreak. While some others experience a recurrence every few months or so.\nRelapses occur less frequently over time after the patient's body begins to produce antibodies against the virus. Symptoms in the relapse phase are also less severe and improve quickly: Blisters appear less frequently, pain is reduced and can heal completely after just a few days.\n\nCause of Herpes\nHSV is a form of virus transmitted through direct contact with blisters or open wounds on the patient's body that are formed after the blisters break. In fact, there are many cases of being infected with the Herpes virus from others due to no symptoms being detected:\n1. HSV-1\nHSV-1 (Oral Herpes) can be transmitted through direct contact with herpes, open wounds at the site of broken blisters, saliva as well as other secretions in the patient's body. Forms of direct contact include:\nKissing.; Oral sex.; Other skin-to-skin contact.\nNote:\nMany cases of Herpes virus infection are caused by touching the face or genitals immediately after contact with the patient's herpes sores.; The phenomenon of herpes in children occurs after being kissed or touched on the face by someone infected with the Herpes virus.; Herpes virus is also transmitted through sharing drinks, sharing personal items such as razors, lip balm, etc. However, the possibility of this happening is relatively low.\n2. HSV-2\nSimilar to HSV-1, HSV-2 (Genital Herpes) can be transmitted through direct contact with herpes, open wounds at the site of broken blisters, saliva and other secretions. in the patient's body. Forms of direct contact include:\nKissing.; Oral sex.; Unsafe sex; Sharing sex toys.; Other skin-to-skin contact at the site of viral infection.\n\nIs Herpes dangerous? Potential complications\nHSV-2 infection triples the risk of HIV infection\nDepending on the stage, Herpes may or may not be dangerous. Some potential complications of the disease are:\n1. Increase the possibility of HIV transmission\nHSV-2 infection triples the risk of HIV infection. Additionally, people infected with both HIV and HSV-2 are more likely to transmit HIV to others. HSV-2 infection is one of the most common infections in people with HIV.\n2. Serious complications\nIn immunocompromised people, including those with advanced HIV infection, herpes may have more severe symptoms and recur more often. Rare complications of HSV-2 include meningitis (brain infection) and disseminated infection. HSV-1 infection can lead to more severe complications such as encephalitis (brain infection) or keratitis (eye infection).\n3. Herpes in newborns\nHerpes in newborns can occur when a newborn is exposed to HSV in the womb. Herpes in newborns is rare, estimated to occur in 10 out of every 100 000 births globally. However, this is a serious condition that can lead to neurological disability or death. The risk of herpes in newborns is greatest when the mother is infected with HSV for the first time late in pregnancy.\n\nHerpes transmission route\nHerpes is spread through close contact with someone infected with the virus. Herpes virus can be found in skin and saliva. People infected with the Herpes simplex virus can transmit the virus to others through blisters or sores after the blisters break.\nHowever, many people infected with the Herpes virus can still infect others even without symptoms. Experts call this asymptomatic viral shedding.\nRoutes of transmission of HSV-1 virus include:\nKissing.; Touch the skin near the patient's mouth; Sharing personal items such as razors, lip balm, and eating utensils; Have oral sex with the sick person.\nRoutes of transmission of HSV-2 virus include:\nIntercourse through the anus, vaginal-penis and vaginal-vaginal intercourse; Having oral sex with someone infected with the Herpes virus; Skin-to-skin contact; Touching the patient's open sores; Newborns whose mothers are or have been infected with the Herpes virus are at risk of being infected in the womb or while breastfeeding.; Herpes cannot be transmitted through sharing a toilet. However, herpes is transmitted through sharing sex toys. People infected with the Herpes virus should be careful not to share sex toys with others. If so, be sure to wash sex toys before and after use, and use condoms as a method of protection.\nFactors that increase the risk of disease\nFactors that increase the risk of Herpes include: (3)\nHaving sex with someone infected with HSV-1 or HSV-2.; Having oral, anal or vaginal sex without using protection (condoms, diaphragms).; Having many sexual partners; Having sex with strangers; Have or have had a history of other sexually transmitted infections or blood infections (STBBI).\nWomen are more at risk of getting genital herpes from their male partners. Studies of couples in which one partner had symptomatic recurrent HSV-2 infection (the source partner) found annual transmission rates of 11% – 17% from the male source partner and 3% – 4% from female source partners.\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nYou should call your doctor for advice and a timely Herpes treatment plan if you experience the following conditions:\nItching or irritation of the genitals; Blisters on the genitals or anus; Feeling pain during intercourse; Painful feeling when urinating; Abnormal, foul-smelling discharge from the genitals; The genitals are red, swollen and painful.\n\nMethods to diagnose Herpes\nDermatologists apply clinical examination methods to diagnose Herpes. The doctor will examine the blistered skin and ask the patient about some signs such as tingling, burning or flu-like symptoms.\nIn many cases, doctors prescribe specimen testing for a more accurate diagnosis. Specimens include fluid in connective tissue suspected of being infected such as the nose, mouth, throat, vagina, anus, rectum and fluid in blisters.\nIn case the patient has been exposed to HSV but has not yet detected symptoms, performing a blood test can help determine whether HSV antibodies exist in the body. However, it should be noted that blood tests may not accurately detect HSV antibodies during the first 12 weeks after a person is infected with the virus.\nNote: General STI screening usually does not include HSV testing. So if you suspect you have been infected with the virus, you need to talk to a dermatologist for advice about testing for HSV.\n\nHow to treat Herpes\nCurrently, there is no complete cure for Herpes. However, applying the following treatment methods helps patients improve symptoms:\n1. Treat HSV with medication\nCold sores caused by the Herpes virus usually heal on their own without needing medical treatment. However, if herpes appears a lot or frequently, the patient should see a doctor for a prescription for antiviral medication.\nOptions include:\nAciclovir (acyclovir).; Famciclovir.; Valacyclovir.\nIn case of HSV infection resistant to other drugs, treatment is with Foscarnet or Cidofovir.\nNote:\nAntiviral drugs help reduce the possibility of HSV transmission during an illness and eliminate the virus in the patient's body. However, there is no evidence that using antiviral drugs helps normal people prevent herpes infection.; Typically, patients use HSV antiviral drugs in cream or pill form. In case of severe symptoms, the doctor prescribes injection of medication directly into the body.\n2. Treat HSV at home\nPatients can apply some of the following treatments at home to reduce pain and discomfort caused by herpes:\nApply hot or cold compresses; Mix baking soda, water and cornstarch.; Mashed garlic mixture mixed with olive oil.; Aloe.; Peppermint essential oil, eucalyptus oil or tea tree oil pre-diluted with a base oil (carrier oil).; Some studies show that Lysine supplements help prevent herpes outbreaks. Dosage estimates vary from person to person, but taking between 1 – 3 grams of Lysine daily is thought to be beneficial for controlling symptoms and reducing relapses.\n\nPrevention methods\nTo prevent Herpes, each person should proactively implement the following methods:\nAvoid physical contact with people who have herpes; Do not share personal care products.; Use safe measures when having sex.; Be monogamous, don't have sex with many people; Test for HSV when abnormal signs are seen.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Center for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology - Urology, Tam Anh General Hospital System, you can make an appointment online through the following ways:\nCall the hotline 0287 102 6789 - 093 180 6858 (HCMC) or 024 3872 3872 - 024 7106 6858 (Hanoi) to register for a private medical appointment with a specialist, through the customer service staff.; Register for a medical appointment with any doctor you trust at the link: https://tamanhhospital.vn/danh-cho-khach-hang/dat-lich-kham/; Send a message on Tam Anh General Hospital Fanpage or Tam Anh General Hospital Urology and Andrology Fanpage; Text message via Zalo OA of Tam Anh General Hospital.\nCurrently, Herpes is not a rare disease. The disease can be treated with medication and some home therapies. However, when detecting a Herpes virus infection, the patient needs to see a specialist for timely examination, consultation and treatment, according to the correct procedure.",
