    "content": "What is infertility? Causes, signs, diagnosis, prevention\n\nInfertility is considered a disease of the times as the incidence rate is increasing and showing signs of rejuvenation. According to some recent statistics, the rate of infertility in couples in Vietnam accounts for 7.7%. So how is infertility defined? Let's find out the causes leading to this situation.\n\nWhat is infertility?\nInfertility as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) is a condition in which a couple cannot become pregnant after one year of living together, having regular intercourse and not using any contraceptive methods. If the wife is over 35 years old, this time is shortened to only 6 months. (first)\nAccording to experts, about 85% of women will conceive naturally within the first 12 months. In the first 3 months of having sex without using any contraceptive method, the fertility rate is 25%. This rate will decrease to 15% in the remaining 9 months.\nTherefore, for couples who are expecting a child and have been trying for at least a year but still have not had good news, they should see a specialist as soon as possible. Treatment should not be delayed because the older they get, the more reproductive function they get. production will decline further.\nInfertility can be divided into two types: primary and secondary infertility. In particular, secondary infertility is the case where the couple has become pregnant at least once. Primary infertility is a case where a couple has never been pregnant before.\n\nCauses of infertility\nThe cause comes from the husband and wife, about 40% of the causes come from the wife, 40% of the causes come from the husband, the rest come from both spouses or infertility of unknown cause. (2)\nSome causes of infertility in women:\nOvulation disorders;; Endometrial optimism;; Premature ovarian failure;; Pelvic inflammatory disease;; Fallopian tube blockage;; Other abnormalities of the fallopian tubes and uterus, such as uterine polyps, uterine fibroids, fallopian tube blockage, uterine deformity, cervical stenosis or adhesions...;; Increased blood prolactin.\nSome causes of infertility in men:\nSperm quality and quantity are not guaranteed;; Diseases and treatment: Varicocele, infections, retrograde ejaculation, tumors, undescended testicles, hormone imbalance, defects in the 2 vas deferens, problems during sexual intercourse Sexual problems (erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation...), Celiac disease, drug use (cancer treatment, ulcer treatment, arthritis...), surgery (vasectomy, scrotal, testicular, glandular surgery) prostate...), anti-sperm antibodies...;; Genetic diseases: Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY), small deletion of Y chromosome, bilateral aplasia of the vas deferens...;; Environmental causes: Excessive exposure to high temperature environments or environments containing many industrial chemicals reduces sperm quantity and quality;; Lifestyle and other causes: Lack of exercise, consuming a lot of fast food, using drugs, drinking alcohol, smoking...\nSmoking is a cause of impaired reproductive health in men.\n\nSigns of infertility\nBoth men and women can experience fertility problems. Warning signs of male infertility may include: (3)\nSmaller or atrophied testicles;; Sexual desire changes;; The testicles are swollen, painful, and lumpy;; Having problems with erection or ejaculation...\nChanges in menstruation or hormonal abnormalities can be signs of a number of diseases related to infertility in women including:\nIrregular menstruation, heavy menstrual flow, longer or shorter duration;; Amenorrhea;; There are changes in sexual desire;; Skin changes, acne;; Weight gain;; Pain during sex;; Abnormal vaginal bleeding;; Abnormal vaginal dischargeâ€¦\nPain in the lower abdomen, heavy vaginal discharge, irregular menstruation... are warning signs that reproductive health is having problems.\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nThe fertility of men and women decreases with age. For women, fertility gradually decreases when they turn 30, and decreases rapidly after age 35. By age 40, a woman's chance of getting pregnant is reduced by half. The reason is that as women get older, the quantity and quality of eggs in both ovaries decrease significantly.\nAge affects fertility, partly because the quality of the released ovum declines. By age 40, about 75% of all oocytes have chromosomal abnormalities, which reduces the chance of pregnancy and increases the risk of miscarriage. Here are a few numbers that show the relationship between a woman's age and fertility:\nThe monthly chance of conceiving drops from 20% for women in their 30s to 5% for women in their 40s.; The risk of chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus increases from 1 in 385 for women in their 30s to 1 in 63 for women in their 40s; Miscarriage occurs in <10% of women in their 20s, while it occurs in >50% of women over 42 years of age.\nIn men, the decline in fertility begins later and is less noticeable but still occurs silently. A husband over 45 years old takes 5 times longer for his wife to get pregnant than a man in his 20s.\nTherefore, couples who are expecting children should not delay the examination for too long, avoid missing the golden time in treatment to achieve the best results. Couples under 35 years old who have been trying to have a baby for at least a year, or over 35 years old who have been trying for a baby for 6 months without results, should see a fertility specialist. receive infertility consultation and examination.\n\nMethods of diagnosing infertility\nTo diagnose infertility, depending on each case, the doctor will prescribe different tests to ensure an accurate diagnosis of the disease as well as check the body's response to the treatment regimen. (4)\nTo diagnose female infertility, there are diagnostic methods such as:\n1. Basic tests:\nBasic tests to diagnose female infertility include: Immunoassay, AMH test, Chlamydia test, thyroid test (TSH, T3, FT4), endocrine test FSH, LH, E2, Prolactin , P4, cervical and breast cancer screening test.\nNecessary ultrasound:\nGynecological ultrasound, ultrasound to count secondary follicles, ultrasound to monitor the development of ovarian follicles, ultrasound of uterine pumping.\nHysterosalpingography (HSG) is used to evaluate the patency of the fallopian tubes.; Hysteroscopy is often used to observe the uterine cavity, helping to diagnose and treat uterine abnormalities. This can be the cause of infertility or repeated implantation failure.\nThe AMH test helps predict the number of eggs remaining in the ovaries.\nTo diagnose male infertility, there are diagnostic methods such as:\nBasic tests:\nBasic tests to diagnose male infertility include: Semen test (semen analysis test), immunological test, endocrine test in men, post-ejaculation urine test, Genetic testing: gene testing and karyotyping, testing to check the level of DNA breakage in sperm (Halosperm Test).\nSome necessary ultrasounds include: Testicular ultrasound, abdominal ultrasound...\nSemen analysis is the first test to check the quantity and quality of male sperm.\n\nCan infertility be cured?\nWhether infertility can be cured is something that many couples are concerned about. Currently, with the development of modern medicine, most diseases that lead to infertility can be completely treated if diagnosed promptly. .\nAccording to Dr. Pham Thi My Tu, there are many factors that directly affect the likelihood of success when treating infertility, including: the age of the woman, the earlier the treatment begins (the younger the age), the more likely it is to begin treatment. the higher the chance of success. The second is the diseases and the health of the couple before treatment. Third is the qualifications and expertise of the team of reproductive support experts, equipment and labs that meet strict standards. In addition, it is necessary to individualize the regimen according to each couple's condition and take care of their health after thorough treatment.\nTherefore, couples who are expecting children should proactively seek medical examination early, and it is important to stay optimistic and proactively share the problems they are experiencing and their concerns with the treating doctor. Persevere with the regimen and have faith in yourself and your doctor because infertility is just a matter of being slower and more difficult to have children than other normal couples, not being unable to have children.\n\nHow to prevent infertility?\nCurrently, infertility is considered the third most dangerous disease after cancer and cardiovascular disease, so how to prevent infertility is always of concern to couples and people of reproductive age.\nPrevention can be done by changing specific daily habits such as:\nPractice a healthy lifestyle, do not abuse alcohol, alcoholic beverages or stimulants, do not use tobacco; Regularly exercise to have good health and improve resistance.; Supplement adequate nutrition, eat healthy foods, limit eating too much sugar, salt, foods containing a lot of preservatives and foods that are too greasy.; Limit exposure to toxic and polluted environments; work in environments exposed to chemicals requires careful protective gear.; Practice healthy sex, be monogamous, have regular sex 2-3 times/week and do not have rough sex.; Go to an infertility doctor immediately if you encounter unusual problems that indicate infertility.\n\nInfertility examination service at Tam Anh\nTam Anh General Hospital's Fertility Support Center brings together a team of doctors and nurses who are leading experts in the field of infertility treatment, possessing modern machinery and equipment systems. Super clean lab meeting strict ISO 5 standards... diversely deploying all of today's most advanced reproductive support techniques, realizing the dream of millions of couples of carrying their \"genuine\" children infertility.\nAt Tam Anh General Hospital Fertility Support Center, there are many fertility support methods such as:\nIntrauterine insemination (IUI);; In vitro fertilization (IVF);; Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI);; Maturation of immature eggs IVM;; Cryopreservation of embryos, oocytes and sperm:; Support embryo hatching (AH);; Blastocyst stage embryo transfer (day 5);; Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT);; Laparoscopic surgery, hysteroscopy in infertility;; Laparoscopic surgery in infertility;; Plastic surgery for genital abnormalities - infertility;\nTo improve the success rate in infertility treatment, in addition to a team of experienced experts/doctors, a lab meeting international standards, and modern equipment, IVFTA also regularly updates new/advanced techniques. most advanced in the world. Specifically:\nResearch application of autologous platelet-rich plasma in the treatment of thin endometrium; Application of mild ovarian stimulation protocol (Mild Stimulation); Application of EmbryoGlueÂ® - a special glue that helps attach the embryo to the uterus; Apply ERA (Endometrial receptivity array) test; Applying artificial intelligence (AI) in embryo culture\nFor advice and guidance on steps to prepare for infertility treatment with leading experts at the Reproductive Support Center of Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nHopefully the above article has answered couples about what infertility is and provided more information about infertility treatment and examination.
