That is, after the right atrium pumps blood into the right ventricle, the valve leaflet does not close tightly, causing blood to flow back into the atrium - where it was just pumped. Over time, severe tricuspid valve regurgitation, if not treated properly, will lead to right ventricular dysfunction and then total heart failure. (first)\n\nDegree of tricuspid valve regurgitation\nDepending on the severity of the condition, tricuspid valve regurgitation is divided into 4 levels:\nTricuspid regurgitation 1/4: This is the mildest level of the disease, has no obvious symptoms and is not dangerous, so no treatment is needed.; 2/4 tricuspid regurgitation: This condition does not necessarily need to be treated because it is of moderate severity. However, patients need to have follow-up examinations as advised by the doctor to monitor the progression of the disease. If symptoms of difficulty breathing, fatigue, rapid heartbeat, etc. appear, the patient needs to be treated according to the appropriate regimen.; 3/4 tricuspid regurgitation: At this stage, the patient will feel difficulty breathing and shortness of breath with increasing severity, causing difficulty in work and daily activities. 3/4 tricuspid regurgitation can still be treated medically, but doctors can consider appropriate surgical methods to prevent the disease from getting worse.; 4/4 tricuspid valve regurgitation: This is the most severe level of heart valve regurgitation with very serious symptoms and the patient is almost unable to work/live as usual. If the patient's symptoms do not improve after taking medication, the doctor will consider surgical heart valve repair or artificial heart valve replacement.\n\nSigns of tricuspid valve regurgitation\nSome people have the disease but do not experience obvious symptoms. Signs only appear when the disease progresses to a moderate or severe stage. If lucky, the disease can be detected when the patient has a regular health check-up, or performs diagnostic imaging for the purpose of diagnosing other diseases. (2)\nCommon symptoms of tricuspid valve regurgitation when the disease progresses to a more severe stage include:\nDifficulty breathing, especially when the patient lies down or exerts himself; Chest pain; Fatigue, especially during vigorous activity; Dizzy; Cough, especially at night or when lying down; Heart palpitations: feeling like the heart is beating like a drum; Swollen feet/ankles or veins in the neck; Heart murmur (detected when using a stethoscope to listen to the heart); Edema of lower extremities or whole body. Small amount of urine\n\nCauses of tricuspid valve regurgitation\nThere are many causes of tricuspid valve regurgitation, the most common of which is right ventricular dilation. The right ventricle is responsible for pumping blood from the heart to the lungs. When the right ventricle is forced to work harder, it needs to increase in size and increase its force of contraction, gradually causing the right heart chamber to dilate. As a result, the tissue ring that supports the tricuspid valve's ability to open and close is also dilated. (3)\nIn addition, a number of other factors can also impact the tricuspid valve and cause it to function incorrectly. These factors include heart failure and heart muscle abnormalities (cardiomyopathy).\nIn addition, tricuspid valve leaks are also caused by complications from certain diseases or medical conditions, such as:\nEmphysema: Disease condition that causes damage to the bronchi and alveoli in the lungs;; Pulmonary hypertension: Increased pressure in the arteries in the lungs and right side of the heart, making it more difficult for the right ventricle to pump blood to the lungs;; Pulmonary valve stenosis: Obstruction of blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery;; Infectious endocarditis: Infection of the inner lining of the heart (endocardium), causing damage to the heart valves;; Abnormal heart valve structure: In this rare condition, the malformed tricuspid valve lies lower than normal in the right ventricle, causing blood to leak backward (reflux) into the right atrium;; Carcinoid syndrome: This is also a rare phenomenon. Accordingly, tumors grow in certain locations in the body, such as in the digestive system, spread to the liver or lymph nodes and produce a hormone-like substance that can damage heart valves. usually tricuspid valve and pulmonary valve;; Implanted device leads: Sometimes, the process of placing or removing a pacemaker implant or defibrillator lead can cause damage to the tricuspid valve;; Endocardial biopsy: This test of myocardial tissue carries the risk of damaging the tricuspid valve;; Trauma: Severe trauma to the chest area (occurring from work accidents, vehicle accidents...) can also damage the heart valve;; Rheumatism: Rheumatic fever is a complication of pharyngitis. If the disease is not treated, the heart valves, including the tricuspid valve, will be damaged, leading to tricuspid valve regurgitation later;; Congenital heart defects: Some congenital heart defects such as Ebstein's anomaly, aortic valve stenosis, pulmonary valve stenosis, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect... are risk factors for tricuspid valve regurgitation;; Marfan syndrome: This is a genetic disorder of connective tissue present at birth, sometimes associated with this disease.\nSome congenital heart defects are precursors to tricuspid valve regurgitation\nRisk factor\nA person with the following risk factors has an increased chance of developing tricuspid valve regurgitation:\nInfectious conditions, such as infective endocarditis or rheumatic fever; Chronic hypertension, especially when the patient is not closely monitored; Use of medications, including some medications for Parkinson's disease and migraines; Radiation, especially chest radiation\n\nDiagnostic method\nIf you are experiencing any of the above symptoms, your doctor may suspect that you have tricuspid valve regurgitation, especially if you have other conditions or risk factors associated with the condition. . (4)\nDiagnosis of tricuspid valve regurgitation often begins with a comprehensive physical examination. The doctor will use a stethoscope to listen to your heart murmur. If you notice unusual sounds, it is most likely a sign that blood is flowing backward. At that time, you will be prescribed the following diagnostic imaging or methods to accurately determine the medical condition:\nElectrocardiogram: measures the electrical impulses of the heart;; Chest X-ray to evaluate the size and shape of the heart as well as the condition of the lungs;; Echocardiography: observe the structure of the heart;; Transesophageal echocardiography: For this method, the doctor will insert a tiny tube with an ultrasound emitter into the digestive tract running from the mouth to the esophagus (near the heart). Thanks to that, detailed images of the heart appear clearly, helping to accurately detect heart valve damage;; Cardiac catheterization: This method is used to determine the cause of tricuspid valve regurgitation. A (small) catheter is inserted into the groin, arm or neck and guided to the heart by X-ray imaging. Contrast dye injected through the catheter allows the doctor to see blood flow through the heart, vessels, and valves;; MRI scan: The magnetic field and radio waves from the MRI machine help create detailed images of the heart;; Exercise or stress tests: These tests help determine the heart's ability to withstand exercise as well as measure the heart's response to exertion;\nBicycle stress echocardiography can help detect abnormalities in the heart.\n\nIs tricuspid regurgitation dangerous?\nPhysiological tricuspid regurgitation and mild regurgitation are not life-threatening if well controlled. However, if the disease is not properly monitored and treated, it will prolong and progress to moderate and severe levels, causing serious complications such as:\nHeart failure: In severe cases of tricuspid regurgitation, blood flows backward into the right atrium and less blood flows forward through the right ventricle into the lungs. This increases pressure on the right ventricle, causing it to dilate (increase in size) and weaken over time, leading to heart failure.; Atrial fibrillation: Some severe patients may have a heart rhythm disorder, called atrial fibrillation.\n\nTreatments\nAs mentioned above, there are cases of tricuspid valve regurgitation that do not require treatment (mild valve regurgitation). Instead, you need to check your heart health regularly to make sure the disease does not get worse. For people with severe symptoms, doctors will prescribe treatment with medication or surgery. Which treatment method to apply will depend on the cause and extent of the leak.\nSome special medications that doctors prescribe for patients with tricuspid valve regurgitation are:\nDiuretic; Antiarrhythmic drugs; Cardiac drugs; Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; Anticoagulants\nIf after a period of taking medication, the disease does not improve and tends to get worse, the doctor will consider one of the following surgical methods:\n1. Repair heart valves\nThe doctor will repair the heart valve by repairing the valve leaflets and sewing small valve rings so they can close tightly, preventing blood from flowing back.\n2. Replace heart valves\nThe damaged valve will be removed and replaced with a mechanical valve or biological valve (made from cow, pig or human heart tissue). Mechanical valves have the advantage of not degenerating, but they can easily form blood clots, causing blockages. Therefore, patients need to take anticoagulants for life to prevent blood clots from forming. Meanwhile, biological valves are susceptible to degeneration over time, meaning the valve's lifespan is shorter, in return there is less risk of blood clots forming.\n\nHow to prevent tricuspid valve regurgitation\nThe most effective way to prevent tricuspid valve regurgitation is to manage potential risk factors, such as rheumatoid arthritis, infective endocarditis, and Marfan syndrome.\nIf you have strep throat, you also need thorough treatment. Because persistent sore throat can lead to rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease - a cause of this condition.\nAlso, talk to your doctor before you take any new medication. Some medications may increase the risk of tricuspid valve regurgitation.\nLifestyle and diet for patients with tricuspid valve regurgitation\nIn addition to complying with your doctor's treatment regimen, adjusting your diet, exercise, and scientific lifestyle also contributes to preventing tricuspid valve regurgitation from progressing. Specifically, patients need:\nMaintain a reasonable weight: Overweight and obesity increase the risk of hypertension and coronary artery disease. These are the reasons why your heart works harder, leading to weakness. Therefore, see if your body mass index (BMI) is within the allowable limit (18.5 - 22.9). If BMI is 23 or higher, you need to plan to lose weight as soon as possible.; Don't smoke: Nicotine and other chemicals in cigarettes (including e-cigarettes) are considered \"silent enemies\", causing damage to the lungs and heart. Quit smoking immediately if you have smoked for many years and avoid inhaling secondhand smoke (passive smoking).; Limit or avoid alcohol: Alcohol can increase the risk of high blood pressure, liver problems and coronary artery disease. Therefore, you need to ask your doctor whether you can drink alcohol or not, and how much alcohol to drink without affecting your health.; Add heart-healthy foods: This food group includes salmon, tuna, walnuts, whole-wheat bread, low-fat dairy products, legumes, olive oil or canola oil. At the same time, limit eating foods that can make your condition worse such as red meat (beef, goat meat, pork...), fast food (hamburgers, fried chicken, French fries, etc.). hotdog...), processed foods (sausages, ham, bacon...), drinks and foods high in sugar (carbonated soft drinks, cakes, ice cream, tea...), foods high in cholesterol ( margarine, nuts, shellfish, popcorn...).\nA heart-friendly diet is the key to improving cardiovascular disease symptoms\nLimit sodium (salt) in your diet: Consuming too much sodium will increase the risk of high blood pressure and cause tricuspid valve regurgitation to progress. Therefore, patients need to minimize the amount of salt in their daily diet. Some habits such as checking food labels (especially canned foods) before buying or prioritizing eating at home and minimizing the number of times you eat out also help control sodium intake effectively.; Exercise as directed: Regular exercise is a way to maintain heart health. However, before exercising, you need to consult your doctor to know which exercises are suitable and how long to practice. This helps prevent risks that may occur when practicing with incorrect technique, over-exercising, inappropriate movements...; If you have a procedure to treat a medical condition, ask your doctor whether you should take antibiotics before and after surgery. Some procedures have the potential to cause bacteria to enter the bloodstream and travel to the heart. This is very dangerous and can make the condition worse; Get vaccinated as recommended by your doctor: Diseases such as influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia, hepatitis B... can potentially threaten patients. Full vaccination is a way to help reduce the risk of these diseases and prevent tricuspid valve regurgitation from progressing.\n\nRelated questions\n1. Can tricuspid valve regurgitation give birth?\nIf you have tricuspid valve regurgitation and are planning to become pregnant, consult your doctor. As the fetus grows larger, the heart has to work harder, which can affect the mother's health. In bad cases, your illness becomes more severe, not only affecting your life but also putting you at risk of premature birth, stillbirth or the fetus having birth defects. Therefore, based on your medical condition and health; At the same time, assessing the possible risks to a pregnant woman with the disease, the doctor will decide whether you can get pregnant or not.\n2. How long can you live with tricuspid valve regurgitation?\nIn general, the prognosis of tricuspid valve regurgitation is quite good, especially in cases of physiological tricuspid valve regurgitation or treatment intervention at an early stage. Therefore, proactively having regular health check-ups and following your doctor's instructions will help you have a healthy heart.\n3. How long after valve replacement surgery can I return to normal activities?\nFull recovery from surgery can take one to several weeks, depending on the rate of wound healing and the type of surgery performed. Currently, Tam Anh General Hospital applies minimally invasive heart surgery techniques, erector spinae plane anesthesia (ESP), active post-operative care... to help patients recover quickly and leave the hospital early after about 3 hours. -5 days.\nTam Anh General Hospital System Cardiovascular Center is led by two leading experts in the field of cardiology: Associate Professor, Dr. Pham Nguyen Vinh (Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City) and Associate Professor, Dr. Nguyen Thi. Bach Yen (Hanoi Tam Anh General Hospital). This place is equipped with advanced machinery systems and comfortable facilities, and has successfully diagnosed and treated many patients with cardiovascular diseases such as stenosis/regurgitation of heart valves, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. , heart attack…\nThe close combination between the Cardiovascular Center and other specialties such as the Diagnostic Imaging Center, Testing Center, General Surgery, General Internal Medicine... helps comprehensively treat patients with many comorbidities. .\nTricuspid valve regurgitation can be completely controlled if detected early. Therefore, each person should proactively screen for cardiovascular diseases periodically. This is even more necessary for people with one or more risk factors to help detect the disease early and intervene effectively.",

However, if the disease is not properly monitored and treated, it will prolong and progress to moderate and severe levels, causing serious complications such as:\nHeart failure: In severe cases of tricuspid regurgitation, blood flows backward into the right atrium and less blood flows forward through the right ventricle into the lungs. This increases pressure on the right ventricle, causing it to dilate (increase in size) and weaken over time, leading to heart failure.; Atrial fibrillation: Some severe patients may have a heart rhythm disorder, called atrial fibrillation."

Repair heart valves\nThe doctor will repair the heart valve by repairing the valve leaflets and sewing small valve rings so they can close tightly, preventing blood from flowing back.\n2. Replace heart valves\nThe damaged valve will be removed and replaced with a mechanical valve or biological valve (made from cow, pig or human heart tissue). Mechanical valves have the advantage of not degenerating, but they can easily form blood clots, causing blockages. Therefore, patients need to take anticoagulants for life to prevent blood clots from forming. Meanwhile, biological valves are susceptible to degeneration over time, meaning the valve's lifespan is shorter, in return there is less risk of blood clots forming.",
