    "content": "Brugada syndrome: Causes, diagnosis and treatment\n\nBrugada syndrome is known as a rare but extremely dangerous heart rhythm disorder that can threaten the patient's life. This article is expertly advised by Dr. Pham Thanh Binh, Doctor at the Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nWhat is Brugada syndrome?\nBrugada syndrome is a condition that causes dangerous heart rhythm disorders in the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles) called ventricular arrhythmias. The most common ventricular arrhythmia in patients with Brugada syndrome is ventricular fibrillation, in which the ventricles beat very rapidly and chaotically, causing fainting and sudden death. Brugada syndrome is one of the causes of sudden death in young people, especially in Southeast Asia and Asia. (first)\nBrugada syndrome is a rare disease caused by a genetic mutation inherited from one parent. The disease was first discovered in 1992. Since then, a lot has been learned about this condition, but there is still much research being done to find new treatments.\n\nSymptoms of Brugada disease\nSymptoms of Brugada syndrome may include: (2)\nAnxiety due to arrhythmia;; Fainting or near fainting;; Cardiac arrest saved;; Sudden death in young people of unknown cause.\nSymptoms of Brugada syndrome are similar to many other arrhythmias. Many people with Brugada disease do not have any symptoms, most patients are only discovered by chance due to a general health check or going to the doctor for another medical condition.\n\nCauses of Brugada syndrome\nBrugada syndrome is often caused by genetic mutations. This mutation can be passed on to future generations. When enough gene mutations accumulate, it will manifest as Brugada syndrome.\nRisk factors for Brugada syndrome include: (3)\nFamily history of Brugada syndrome: If other family members have had Brugada syndrome, you are at increased risk of developing the syndrome as well.; Men: Men are more often diagnosed with Brugada syndrome than women..; Race: Brugada syndrome occurs more in Asians than other races.; Fever: Fever does not cause Brugada syndrome, but it can irritate the heart and cause fainting or sudden cardiac arrest in people with Brugada syndrome, especially in children.\n\nHow to screen for Brugada disease?\nWhen there are symptoms of suspected arrhythmia, especially people whose immediate family has a sudden death, these people should have an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check for Brugada. Because Brugada syndrome is a genetic condition passed from generation to generation, if someone in your family has had Brugada, you should be screened to see if you have the disease (family includes parents, your siblings and children).\nIf someone in your family has been diagnosed with Brugada disease, you should see a doctor who specializes in arrhythmia for advice. You may have some screening tests to help your doctor assess your risk of the disease and advise on appropriate treatment.\n\nDiagnosis of Brugada syndrome\nAn arrhythmia specialist will perform a clinical examination and prescribe paraclinical tests for you, including:\nElectrocardiogram (ECG): helps screen, can detect abnormal signs on the ECG suggesting Brugada disease.; ECG with medication: In some cases where the ECG measurement shows unclear signs of abnormality, the doctor measures the ECG with medication or performs tests to help increase the likelihood of revealing the disease to clarify the diagnosis.; You may also have additional genetic tests to partially confirm the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. This genetic test should also be offered to other family members of the patient.; Electrophysiological examination of the heart: a doctor specializing in arrhythmia will use electrodes inserted into the heart chambers to examine and check to see if any dangerous ventricular arrhythmias have been triggered. Depending on the survey results, your doctor will recommend the next appropriate treatment for you.\nCardiac electrophysiological testing is one of the methods to diagnose Brugada Syndrome.\n\nTreatment for Brugada Syndrome\nIf you are diagnosed with Brugada syndrome, have a history of dangerous ventricular arrhythmias, a history of cardiac arrest that has been resuscitated, or an electrophysiological examination notes a dangerous arrhythmia, the disease is considered to be at risk of sudden death. High. At this time, your doctor may recommend an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) to prevent sudden death. To date, only ICD implantation is the most effective method to prevent sudden arrhythmic death in patients with Brugada syndrome.\n\nSubjects at risk of Brugada syndrome\nBrugada syndrome is more common in men than women. In fact, men are 8-10 times more likely to get this disease than women. All patients with a family history of sudden cardiac death or a direct relative with Brugada should be screened for the disease.\n\nCaring for patients with Brugada Syndrome\nIf you have been diagnosed with Brugada syndrome, you should be evaluated and treated by an experienced Arrhythmia specialist. This approach helps ensure that you receive the best possible care by a team of doctors: (4)\nCardiologist;; Doctor specializing in cardiac arrhythmia;; Genetic doctor;; Your family doctor regularly looks after your health.\nContact us now for advice and to schedule an examination with leading cardiovascular experts at Tam Anh General Hospital System:\nComplications of Brugada syndrome require emergency medical attention, including fainting or sudden cardiac arrest. If not treated immediately, sudden loss of heart function, breathing, and consciousness (usually occurring during sleep) occurs, which can be fatal. With quick and appropriate medical care, the patient can be saved.",
