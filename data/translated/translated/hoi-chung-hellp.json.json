    "content": "HELLP syndrome: Causes, signs and prevention\n\nHELLP syndrome in pregnant women is a variant of preeclampsia, which usually occurs in the last trimester of pregnancy, or after childbirth.\n\nWhat is HELLP syndrome?\nHELLP syndrome is a disorder related to preeclampsia that, if not treated promptly, can cause death. HELLP is a common form of pregnancy toxemia in 5-8% of pregnant women, most commonly after week 20 of pregnancy. Symptoms of HELLP are often quite vague, broad and difficult to recognize and diagnose early.\nMany studies have long shown that preeclampsia may be associated with symptoms of hemolysis, increased liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia. Dr. Louis Weinstein considers those constituent signs and symptoms to constitute an entity separate from severe preeclampsia. In 1982 he named the condition HELLP syndrome after its characteristics: (1)\nH – Hemolysis (hemolysis); EL – Elevated liver enzymes (increased liver enzymes); LP – Low platelets (thrombocytopenia)\nThe syndrome can be difficult to diagnose, especially in the absence of high blood pressure and protein in the urine. Symptoms of HELLP are sometimes confused with gastritis, flu, acute hepatitis, gallbladder disease or other trimester conditions.\n70% of women with HELLP syndrome occur before giving birth and 30% occur within 48 hours to 7 days after birth. 20% of women with this syndrome after giving birth had no signs of eclampsia before giving birth. Recurrence rates in subsequent pregnancies are 3% for HELLP, 10-14% for IUGR (intrauterine growth retardation) and 18-20% for pre-eclampsia.\nMortality rates from this syndrome have been reported to be as high as 30%. That is why pregnant mothers need to be aware of the condition and its symptoms so they can intervene and treat it early.\n\nClassify\nThis syndrome is classified based on the level and number of platelets in the mother's blood.\nClassification by degree - According to the classification of the American Obstetrics and Gynecology Association in 2000. Partial HELLP syndrome when there are 1 or 2 abnormal signs. Complete HELLP syndrome: has many complications for the mother, pregnancy should be terminated.; Partial HELLP syndrome when there are 1 or 2 abnormal signs.; Complete HELLP syndrome: has many complications for the mother, pregnancy should be terminated.; Based on the number of platelets in the mother's blood, the disease is divided into three types, according to a system called the “Mississippi classification”: Type I (severe thrombocytopenia): platelets less than 50,000/mm3 Type II (decreased thrombocytopenia): moderate platelets): platelets from 50,000 – 100,000/mm3 Type III (AST> 40 IU/L, mild thrombocytopenia): platelets from 100,000 – 150,000/mm3; Type I (severe thrombocytopenia): platelets less than 50,000/mm3; Type II (moderate thrombocytopenia): platelets from 50,000 – 100,000/mm3; Type III (AST> 40 IU/L, mild thrombocytopenia): platelets from 100,000 – 150,000/mm3\n\nSubjects and risk factors for disease\nHELLP syndrome in women is a rare disorder, affecting less than 1% of all pregnancies. However, this is a major problem that affects the health of pregnant women and can threaten the lives of both mother and fetus. This syndrome usually appears in the last three months of pregnancy, but can occur earlier, or after birth.\nSubjects at high risk of disease (2) include:\nWomen over 35 years old;; Fat;; Have a history of diabetes or kidney disease;; Having high blood pressure during pregnancy;; History of preeclampsia before birth.\nOne study found that the risk of recurrence of pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders including preeclampsia and HELLP in subsequent pregnancies is approximately 18% if the woman has a history of the disease. (3)\n\nSymptoms of HELLP\nHELLP can manifest differently in each person and is easily confused with symptoms of flu or stomach illness, commonly such as:\nFatigue and discomfort for several days;; Nausea, vomiting;; Pain in the shoulder, neck, epigastric or right upper quadrant of the abdomen;; Epigastric pain or pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen may be due to blood flow obstruction in the hepatic sinusoids caused by the deposition of intravascular fibrin;; Headache and visual disturbances;; Weight gain due to generalized edema, and proteinuria over 1+ (in 90% of cases);; Swelling, especially in the hands or face; Pain when taking deep breaths.\nOnly a doctor can be sure that the symptoms you are experiencing are not signs of serious health problems. Therefore, you need to see a doctor for timely diagnosis and intervention when there are unusual signs during pregnancy.\n\nCause\nThe exact cause of HELLP has not yet been determined, but the presence of blood clotting is considered the main factor. Some experts believe this is a severe form of preeclampsia, an obstetric complication caused by high blood pressure. About 10 - 20% of women with preeclampsia will develop HELLP syndrome in obstetrics.\n\nDiagnostic method\nDiagnosis of the disease can be based on 3 main characteristics (4), including:\nHemolysis: occurs due to the transport of red blood cells within damaged blood capillaries. Common symptoms are broken red blood cell fragments and deformed red blood cells (schistocytes) on blood smears. Haptoglobin, bilirubin, LDH increased; Increased liver enzymes: is anemia in the liver leading to infarction. These lesions have symptoms such as epigastric pain, vomiting, nausea or right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes. Severe complications (1%) that may occur are hematoma under the liver capsule, even rupture into the abdominal cavity.; Thrombocytopenia: Due to microvascular damage, mainly intravascular damage and vasospasm, the consequences of serotonin and thromboxane A2 increase platelet aggregation in the vascular lumen.\nHELLP can be difficult to diagnose clinically because it is easily confused with other diseases in pregnancy such as: acute fatty liver of pregnancy, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, appendicitis, gallbladder disease, ejaculation. thrombocytopenia, lupus flare, antiphospholipid syndrome, hemolytic uremic syndrome, thrombocytopenic purpura.\nAccording to one study, of 46 women who developed liver disease during pregnancy that required treatment, 70% of cases had acute fatty liver disease and 15% had HELLP pregnancy syndrome. This syndrome is difficult to distinguish from acute fatty liver disease based only on clinical symptoms because both have quite similar clinical symptoms and appear at the same time during pregnancy. Therefore, the doctor may prescribe some additional paraclinical tests to strengthen the basis of diagnosis.\n\nSymptoms\nIf the disease is not detected early and promptly intervened, it can lead to dangerous complications such as:\nLiver rupture;; Hematoma under the liver capsule, liver fissure;; CKD;; Acute respiratory failure;; Excessive bleeding (hemorrhage) during birth;; Stroke;; Placental abruption;; Pulmonary edema;; Perinatal asphyxia causes death of both mother and fetus.\nThe most common reasons why mothers become critically ill, or even die, are due to liver rupture or stroke (cerebral edema or cerebral hemorrhage). Therefore, early detection and treatment is key to preventing these complications. However, some complications can occur even with treatment and affect mother and baby after birth.\n\nTreatments\nThe method of intervention for postpartum HELLP syndrome is to terminate the pregnancy and quickly remove the fetus from the uterus. Stabilize blood pressure if any, and other manifestations of HELLP such as seizures and DIC as well as monitor the fetus. Most cases recover completely within 24 - 48 hours or within 5 days after giving birth, however in some cases symptoms can last up to 14 days.\n\nPrevention of HELLP syndrome\nCurrently, there is no effective prevention method to prevent this syndrome. Pregnant women can limit the risk of disease by maintaining a healthy lifestyle, exercise and proper nutrition to help prevent gestational diabetes or high blood pressure.\nIn addition, regular prenatal examinations help doctors promptly detect the risk of preeclampsia progressing to eclampsia or HELLP to intervene promptly to avoid dangerous complications.\nIn addition, some notes can help pregnant mothers prevent such as:\nPrepare for good health and physical condition before pregnancy;; Go for regular prenatal checkups;; Provide your obstetrician with a family history of HELLP, preeclampsia, or other hypertensive disorders;; Recognize unusual signs and immediately go to medical facilities for examination and treatment.\n\nHow to care for pregnant mothers when sick\nMost women with HELLP will recover completely if the condition is treated early. Symptoms also improve significantly after the baby is born and should disappear within a few days to weeks after birth. However, pregnant women need to be closely monitored by a doctor after giving birth to assess whether the disease has been completely treated.\nFor the fetus, HELLP leads to the risk of premature birth, so babies born before 37 weeks need to be carefully monitored in the hospital before going home.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n1. How does HELLP syndrome affect newborns?\nSome studies show that newborn babies weighing less than 2,000 grams born to infected mothers need to stay in the hospital longer and may require ventilator care. In developed countries, the rate of stillbirth (baby death in the uterus after 20 weeks) is 51/1,000 pregnancies. This rate is higher than both severe preeclampsia and eclampsia.\nOverall perinatal mortality \\ (stillbirth plus neonatal death) ranges from 7.7% – 60%. Most of these deaths are believed to be due to placental abruption (the placenta separates prematurely from the uterus), placental abruption due to intrauterine asphyxia (the fetus does not receive enough oxygen), and premature birth.\n2. What is the risk of getting HELLP in the next pregnancy?\nThe risk of recurrence of all forms of preeclampsia is HIGHER in women with a history of the condition. The rate of preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancies ranges from 16 – 52%, with higher rates if HELLP syndrome develops in the second trimester. The HELLP recurrence rate ranges from 2 - 19% depending on the patient population studied.\nAccompanying mothers from pregnancy to labor, Tam Anh General Hospital provides comprehensive health care services such as full maternity, on-demand maternity, pre- and post-natal care,...
