    "content": "Kallmann syndrome: Signs, causes, diagnosis and treatment\n\nKallmann syndrome is a form of congenital hypogonadism caused by the body's lack of production of certain hormones that direct sexual development. Normally, the hypothalamic-pituitary region of the brain secretes gonadotropic hormones that activate puberty and reproductive function.\n\nWhat is Kallmann syndrome?\nKallmann syndrome is a genetic disorder (gene abnormality) that interferes with puberty (delayed or no puberty) and impairs olfactory function (inability to recognize smells). The disease appears from birth, but is often diagnosed late when the child is 14-16 years old when parents realize that the child does not have pubertal characteristics. (first)\nOther names for this syndrome: (2)\nHypogonadism and anemia; Idiopathic hypogonadism; Hypogonadism partial or complete loss of smellÂ  (anosmia); Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and partial or complete loss of smell (anosmia); Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism- partial or complete loss of smell (anosmia); Olfactory syndrome\nWhat is Kallmann syndrome? This is a rare syndrome, occurring more in men than women, with a rate of 1/30,000 men and 1/120,000 women. Due to genetic characteristics, Kallmann syndrome appears right from birth. Male patients often have an abnormally small penis and unenlarged testicles. During puberty, most patients do not develop sexual characteristics such as: No beard, high-pitched voice (in men), no menstruation, no breast development (in women), no hair armpit pubic hair or pubic hair and scanty. If not treated early, the patient will become infertile and have psychological abnormalities due to not developing normally like their peers, accompanied by metabolic disorders due to decreased sex hormones.\n\nSymptoms of Kallmann syndrome\nSigns of impaired olfactory function (inability to recognize odors) are the main symptoms that help early recognition or suggest Kallmann syndrome. (3)\nOther symptoms include:\nCleft lip/cleft palate; Has 1 kidney; Hearing loss; Abnormal eye movements; Undescended testicles; Abnormalities of finger bones; The phenomenon of hand synkinesis (tendency to imitate the other hand's movements during movement) causes difficulty when performing tasks that require the two hands to move separately, such as playing a musical instrument.\n\nCauses of Kallmann syndrome\nIn people with Kallmann syndrome, genetic mutations change the movement or function of certain nerve cells in the brain. Before your baby is born, olfactory neurons (which are responsible for smell) and neurons that produce gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) are formed as the nose is developing. GnRH is a hormone in the hypothalamus that stimulates the pituitary gland to produce gonadotropins. Gonadotropin is a gonadotropin hormone in the pituitary gland, which has an effect on reproductive organs such as testicles in men and ovaries in women to secrete sex hormones,...\nNormally, when the fetus matures, nerve cells begin to move from the nose to the brain, to the hypothalamus (responsible for secreting the hormone GnRH, regulating body temperature and breathing rate). However, due to certain genetic mutations, these neurons do not move properly during development in patients with Kallmann syndrome.\nAs a result, after birth, people with Kallmann syndrome show signs of impaired olfactory function and difficulty recognizing scents. This also means that the brain does not release GnRH at normal levels.\nWhen GnRH from the hypothalamus is impaired, the pituitary gland will not adequately secrete gonadotropins such as FSH and LH. FSH is a hormone that stimulates ovarian follicle development and sperm production. LH is a hormone that releases eggs and stimulates the ovaries and testicles to create sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone.\nIn normal people, these hormones promote the gonads to produce testosterone and estrogen, thereby promoting the development of secondary sexual characteristics (such as breast development, pubic hair, facial hair). As for people with Kallmann syndrome, they may need the intervention of hormone replacement therapy to promote the release of these hormones.\n\n3 ways of inheritance of Kallmann syndrome\nGenetic mutations are the cause of the disease\n1. Inherited by X-linked sex chromosomes\nMen only need to receive an X chromosome carrying the mutated gene from their mother to manifest the disease. For females (people with two X chromosomes), two mutated genes are needed. This type of inheritance also means that the father cannot transmit the disease to his son (because the son only receives the Y chromosome from the father). An example of Kallmann syndrome inherited in this manner is a mutation in the ANOS1 gene.\n2. Autosomal dominant inheritance\nOnly one parent needs to carry the mutated gene to pass it on to their children and cause the disease. A child only needs to carry one mutated gene to develop the disease. Kallmann syndrome is caused by the following gene mutations and has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, including: FGFR1, PROKR2, PROK2, CHD7, FGF8.\n3. Autosomal recessive inheritance\nBoth parents (usually asymptomatic) can have a child with Kallmann syndrome. In this case, the child must carry 2 disease-causing genes received from father and mother. The mutated genes in this case are PROKR and PROK2.\n\nComplications may occur\nKallmann syndrome is not life-threatening, but the disease often lasts a lifetime. As adults, people with Kallmann syndrome also face the possibility of having difficulty having children if not treated. However, hormone replacement treatments can be effective in enhancing fertility for patients. Once diagnosed, symptoms can be well managed.\nThere are cases where patients are misdiagnosed as infertile, but there are effective treatments that can help restore fertility for both men and women.\n\nDiagnosis of Kallmann syndrome\nHealth abnormalities caused by this syndrome often appear at birth, but can be diagnosed later (puberty at 14-16 years old). Diagnosis of the disease is based on clinical examination, endocrine tests, imaging and genetic tests. (4)\nClinical signs: Symptoms and signs of delayed puberty or loss of smell. This feature helps distinguish Kallmann syndrome from most other forms of hypogonadism, which do not affect the sense of smell.\nBiochemical testing: Is an important part in diagnosing Kallmann syndrome. The GnRH hormone cannot be measured directly in the body. Instead, it tests blood levels of hormones such as LH, FSH and sex hormones such as testosterone, estrogen and progesterone. These hormones will be low in Kallmann syndrome\nAt the same time, coordinate with doctors from the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Center to examine the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and nose to find the cause of abnormalities in hormone secretion and loss of function. smell.\nFinally genetic tests may be performed to confirm the diagnosis of the disease.\nGenetic testing, a genetic mutation that affects the development of certain nerve cells in the brain is the cause of Kallmann syndrome. There are about 25 different genes related to this syndrome, but the most common are mutations in 6 genes ANOS1, CHD7, FGF8, FGFR1, PROK2 and PROKR2. These gene mutations account for about 50% of cases of Kallmann syndrome. The remaining cases may have unknown causes or be due to new mutations that have not yet been discovered.\n\nHow to treat Kallmann syndrome\nHormone treatment can trigger puberty and improve fertility. According to Dr. Dung, the main goal of treating Kallmann syndrome is to stimulate puberty and restore the patient's fertility.\nHormone replacement therapy helps restore male fertility\nHormone replacement treatment for Kallmann syndrome may begin with replacement of sex hormones such as testosterone for men; estrogen and progesterone for women. Testosterone and estrogen/progesterone replacement therapy by themselves will not restore fertility. The goal of this treatment is to stimulate puberty and the development of secondary sexual characteristics. Sex hormone treatment also plays an important role in maintaining bone density, which can decline due to lack of sex hormones.\nHowever, using injection therapy with hormones such as FSH or LH, as well as synthetic forms of GnRH, can help restore fertility as well as stimulate the ovaries and testicles to synthesize sex hormones.\nSome studies show that 10% - 20% of people with congenital hypogonadism regain their ability to produce these hormones. However, this recovery may not last.\nEstimated statistics show that fertility can be achieved in 75% - 80% of male patients. Therapies such as pulsatile GnRH may also help stimulate ovulation in women. Or assisted reproductive therapy is also an option for people with Kallmann syndrome who want to conceive.\n\nPrevention of Kallmann syndrome\nAs a congenital disease syndrome, preventing the disease is first to determine whether or not the disease is present in relatives, parents, brothers, etc. Follow the doctor's advice such as regular medical examinations, stopping smoking. Smoking, drinking alcohol, exercising, preventing stress, supplementing zinc, etc. also help proactively prevent Kallman disease.\nWhen medication is needed to supplement hormone production, periodic follow-up checks are needed to ensure the treatment is effective. The dosage and combination of drugs may need to be adjusted over time.\nTo be examined and consulted directly with Dr. CKI Phan Thi Thuy Dung, please call hotline 0287.102.6789 (HCMC)/ 024.3872.3872 (HN), inbox fanpage directly or book online here: https://tamanhhospital.vn/chuyen- price/phan-thi-thuy-dung/\nWith hormone replacement therapy, Kallmann patients can enter puberty, improving symptoms caused by sex hormone deficiency but not curing the genetic mutations that are the main cause of Kallmann syndrome. Besides, there are still effective treatments to help restore fertility for both men and women.",
