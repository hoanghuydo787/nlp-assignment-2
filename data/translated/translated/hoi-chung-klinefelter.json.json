    "content": "Klinefelter syndrome: Causes, signs, diagnosis and treatment\n\nKlinefelter syndrome is a common sex chromosome disorder, accounting for 2/3 of chromosomal abnormalities in male infertility patients with a rate of 1/1000 live births. Klinefelter syndrome causes germ cells to not exist in the testicles, leading to decreased sperm production and androgen levels in the blood. According to Dr. Pham Thi My Tu, Center for Reproductive Support, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, \"Men with Klinefelter syndrome with chromosome 47 XXY are susceptible to hypogonadism, poor spermatogenesis, and even azoospermia.\" However, there may still be a chance to have a biological child thanks to modern fertility treatments.” (first)\n\nWhat is Klinefelter syndrome?\nKlinefelter syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality that causes hypogonadism and infertility in men. For normal men, the chromosome set will have 46 chromosomes with the sex chromosome pair being XY. Men with Klinefelter syndrome have 2 or more X chromosomes in the chromosome set (XXY).\nThe clinical phenotype of patients with Klinefelter syndrome is tall stature, observed small testes and gynecomastia, with no sperm found in the semen.\n\nDisease incidence\nKlinefelter syndrome has a frequency of about 1/1000 male newborns. In infancy, the disease will not have specific clinical manifestations, so it is difficult to recognize through external observation. (2)\n\nCauses of Klinefelter's disease\nWith Klinefelter, the most common karyotype is 47, XXY (accounting for 90%). Mosaic chromosomes such as 46, XY/47, XXY, and other aneuploidies such as 48, XXXY, and 49, XXXXY have also been described. The appearance of an extra X chromosome is random and due to nondisjunction during meiosis or postzygotic nondisjunction. The severity of the phenotype will often correlate with the number of X chromosomes added.\nAccording to studies, the origin of abnormal chromosomes from the father accounts for about 53%, 34% is due to meiosis I disorder in the mother, 9% is due to meiosis II disorder in the mother and the remaining 3% is due to zygote cleavage disorder. . Advanced maternal age increases abnormalities in meiosis I. Having an extra X chromosome leads to hyalineization and fibrosis of the testicles, reduces spermatogenesis, causes genital abnormalities and infertility. An increase in the number of X chromosomes leads to an increase in intellectual disability and deformities.\n\nCommon symptoms\nCommon symptoms in men with Klinefelter syndrome include: (3)\n1. Babies and children\nIn newborns, it is often difficult to tell whether the baby has this syndrome or not because there are no important or specific deformities such as undescended testicles, low deviated urinary tract, or underdeveloped penis.\nChildren show signs of muscle weakness, slow motor and intellectual development such as slow crawling, walking, speaking... compared to children of the same age, closed personality and testicles do not descend into the scrotum.\n2. Puberty and adulthood\nTypical signs are a tall figure and long limbs, however there are also cases of men with normal morphology. Common symptoms are undeveloped testicles, little hair, epididymis may be larger than testicles, testicles are shrunken and hard due to hyaline and fibrosis, enlarged mammary glands, female body shape, and increased FSH. , low testosterone, reduced sexual desire and often infertility due to lack of sperm.\nEnlarged breast tissue is one of the signs of Klinefelter syndrome in men.\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nMen in puberty and adulthood who notice characteristics related to Klinefelter syndrome should go to medical facilities specializing in andrology or reproductive support for examination.\n\nIs Klinefelter dangerous?\nChildren with Klinefelter syndrome may have low muscle tone (myasthenia), and may be slow to develop motor skills, such as sitting, standing, and walking. Boys with Klinefelter syndrome have learning difficulties, delayed language development, and problems with reading and speaking. People with Klinefelter syndrome tend to have better receptive language skills (the ability to understand speech) than expressive language skills (vocabulary and pronunciation) and may have difficulty with communication and expression. show yourself.\nPeople with Klinefelter syndrome tend to have anxiety, depression, impaired social skills, behavioral problems such as emotional immaturity and impulsivity, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and restrictive behavior. Problem-solving skills. About 10% of boys and men with Klinefelter syndrome have autism spectrum disorder.\nNearly half of men with Klinefelter syndrome have metabolic syndrome, a group of conditions that includes type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Compared with unaffected men, adults with Klinefelter syndrome also have an increased risk of developing involuntary tremors, breast cancer (if gynecomastia develops), osteoporosis, and other disorders. autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatism and arthritis.\n\nDiagnosis of Klinefelter\nDiagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome is usually made prenatally or postnatally by karyotyping or microarray. Prenatal diagnosis can be performed using the NIPT method to identify sex chromosome abnormalities; the published positive predictive value of this method for Klinefelter syndrome is 67%. Other prenatal and postnatal tests are performed for confirmation in suspected cases.\nAfter birth, the disease is diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and confirmed diagnosis by cytogenetic analysis of chromosomes, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, and/or chromosome microarray analysis.\n\nTreatment of Klinefelter syndrome\nIn recent years, the development of genetic medicine has helped people have more hope in treating diseases related to genetics and chromosomes. Early diagnosis of Klinefelter in utero allows scientists to assess neuropsychological development and provide early intervention measures.\nThe rate of delayed speech and motor skills is present in 50-70% of patients, so early intervention to address these problems is recommended. If the problem of delayed speech is not addressed, it leads to limited self-expression, contributing to behavioral problems.\nBesides, mobility problems such as myasthenia gravis, hyperactivity, flat feet, knees touching each other... affect motor development... so it is necessary to apply physical therapy and speech therapy. , neuropsychological testing to learn more about language, oral reading, and cognition.\nMen with Klinefelter syndrome often have early onset of hypogonadism, with some cases of hypogonadism starting during pregnancy. Testosterone supplementation prescribed by a physician may prevent some of the phenotypic manifestations of Klinefelter syndrome.\nMen with Klinefelter syndrome usually go through puberty normally, and endogenous testosterone helps support the masculinization process with the development of penis and pubic hair. However, this group of patients often has little hair on the face and body. Testosterone supplementation may help reduce onset gynecomastia in teenage men. The use of androgen replacement is individualized and can be initiated at puberty or delayed until the patient has clear evidence of hypogonadism.\nIn the field of assisted reproduction, the introduction of advanced microsurgical techniques such as sperm extraction from testicles with the micro-TESE method has successfully brought the opportunity to become fathers for more than half of men with the syndrome. Klinefelter.\nDoctor Pham Thi My Tu said, \"In the past, men with Klinefelter syndrome were often prescribed sperm to be able to have children. But now, with modern medicine, finding sperm for Klinefelter people is not too difficult thanks to the Micro TESE method. 75% of patients with genetic diseases that cause testicular atrophy such as Klinefelter syndrome have found sperm thanks to Micro TESE surgery.\"\nWith the help of a microscope, the micro-TESE technique can \"dig deep\" into \"every corner\" of the testicles to find healthy sperm. As long as sperm is found, this technique has sparked hope for thousands of infertile patients to become fathers and happily welcome their own children.\nIn the long term, men with Klinefelter face many other health problems such as an increased risk of disorders related to insulin resistance such as type 2 diabetes, fatty liver, thromboembolism, and heart failure. blood lipids, peripheral vascular disease... Bone density also has negative effects, the rate of osteoporosis is higher, the risk of facing malignant tumors also increases. Therefore, patients need to be examined regularly and thoroughly for effective treatment.\nAccording to doctor Pham Thi My Tu, \"At IVFTA-HCMC, in addition to trying to help Klinefelter patients have children, we also focus on improving quality of life. Most patients with this syndrome suffer from hypogonadism leading to early menopause. However, there are still many cases where patients can be treated easily if detected early. We always consult interdisciplinary and proactively remind patients to have annual check-ups to take care of their health. We understand that as a family, we not only want to have children, but the father and mother must also be healthy to accompany and nurture those babies into good citizens.\"\nMen with Klinefelter syndrome still have the opportunity to have children.\nBeing diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome is not easy to accept, especially during puberty and adolescence. For these cases, a family therapist, counselor or psychologist can help resolve psychological and emotional problems or remove the patient's psychological complexes.\n\nPreventive measures for Klinefelter syndrome\nFaced with the dangerous effects of this syndrome, many people worry whether Klinefelter can be prevented. Unfortunately, Klinefelter syndrome cannot be prevented because it is a disease that occurs due to genetic abnormalities. For women who become pregnant after the age of 35, they should consult their doctor and plan their pregnancy and assess potential risks. (4)\nCurrently, Klinefelter screening can be performed prenatally in the fetus with the NIPT method. In case a child is detected with abnormalities that suggest symptoms of this syndrome, the doctor will plan an in-depth diagnosis and early treatment to help the child develop healthily and limit complications.\nDiagnosis and treatment of patients with Klinefelter syndrome should be performed by a team of specialists including andrologists, endocrinologists, internists, fertility doctors, and geneticists. , neurologist and physical therapist.\nAlthough there is no way to correct the sex chromosome abnormalities caused by Klinefelter syndrome, treatments can help minimize the negative effects of the disease. The earlier diagnosis and treatment is started, the greater the benefit. However, it is never too late for men to start treatment.\n\nWhat should people with Klinefelter syndrome do?\nMen with Klinefelter syndrome may benefit from self-care measures that promote healthy mental, physical, emotional, and social development such as:\nLearn about Klinefelter syndrome: searching for information about the disease provides accurate data and helps find a reputable medical address.; Regular check-ups with your doctor help prevent future health problems.; Participate in sports and physical activities. These activities will help build muscle strength and motor skills.; Participate in group activities, which can help develop social skills.; Connect with support groups or communities that help people with Klinefelter syndrome. This is a common condition and you are not alone. Talking in support groups can help answer questions and reduce anxiety.\nTam Anh General Hospital System's Reproductive Support Center brings together a team of leading experts in internal medicine and surgery. The Center's experts and doctors master the latest techniques, early detection and effective treatment of male infertility diseases, especially infertility related to genetics, diseases... to help patients withdraw from the disease. Shorten hospital stay, limit the risk of recurrence, improve quality of life and realize the dream of fatherhood.\nIn addition, IVFTA is the leading fertility center with a high success rate in the country, with the application of advanced technology and modern techniques such as: Application of platelet-rich plasma in internal treatment. thin uterine lining, endometrial failure, multiple consecutive miscarriages; Use mild ovarian stimulation regimens for women with low ovarian reserve (AMH), premature ovarian failure, and poor ovarian response; ERA Test evaluates the receptivity of the endometrium; immature egg maturation (IVM); intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI); Supports embryo hatching; preimplantation genetic testing (PGT); cryopreservation of gametes (sperm, eggs); Cryopreservation of tissue (testicular tissue, ovarian tissue)... along with advanced regimens, new drugs... contribute to increasing the success rate of IVF, ensuring reproductive health for patients.\nHopefully this article has provided enough information about Klinefelter syndrome to readers. If you notice that you have signs of illness, you should see a doctor as soon as possible. The sooner the disease is detected, the higher the prognosis for effective treatment. If readers still have questions that need answering, they can contact IVFTA-HCMC for detailed advice.",
