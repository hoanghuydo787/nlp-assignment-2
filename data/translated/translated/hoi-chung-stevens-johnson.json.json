    "content": "Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS): Causes, signs, treatment\n\nStevens Johnson syndrome is characterized by ulcers in the natural orifices of the body such as the eyes, nose, mouth, throat, urinary tract, etc. It is a rare disease, with an incidence of 2/1,000,000 people. 5% – 30% of deaths.\n\nWhat is Stevens-Johnson syndrome?\nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a serious skin condition characterized by red skin rashes that blister and then peel. The skin around the eyes, genitals and mouth are also affected. If unfortunately this condition occurs, in severe cases, the patient may have to be hospitalized for treatment. (first)\nMany people believe that SJS and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are two diseases, but others consider them to be one disease but with different levels of severity. Stevens Johnson syndrome causes less severe manifestations than TEN. For example, skin peeling in people with SJS can affect less than 10% of the body, while in people with TEN, the extent of the impact is up to more than 30% of the body. However, both of these conditions are potentially life-threatening.\nOther names for this syndrome include:\nLyell's syndrome; Stevens-Johnson/ toxic epidermal necrolysis; Stevens-Johnson spectrum toxic epidermal necrolysis; Stevens-Johnson due to medication; Stevens-Johnson caused by mycoplasma (if related to a specific cause)\n\nCommon symptoms\nStevens Johnson syndrome is characterized by ulcers in natural openings of the body such as the eyes, nose, mouth, throat, urinary tract... For women, vulvar and vaginal ulcers can occur. occurs with bleeding. In men, in addition to the usual locations, ulcers can also appear in the urinary tract with symptoms of burning and pain when urinating. Additionally, other symptoms include:\nErythema on the skin; Fever; Muscle pain; Cough; Skin peeling; Drooling (due to difficulty closing the mouth); Conjunctival congestion\n\nCauses of Stevens Johnson disease\nRisk factors for developing Stevens-Johnson syndrome may come from a combination of factors including environmental and genetics. While environmental factors can cause genes to be activated, the genetic cause comes from specific human leukocyte antigens (HLA), increasing a person's risk of developing SJS or TEN.\nMedicines are the main cause of this condition.\nIn addition, allergic reactions to drugs are a common cause of this syndrome. All drugs have the risk of causing allergies to varying degrees. Some drugs with a \"high\" risk of causing illness are: (2)\nAllopurinol; Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; Sulfonamide antibiotics; Aminopenicillin; Cephalosporin; Quinolone; Carbamazepine; Phenytoin; Phenobarbital and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) belong to the Oxicam family.\nOther less common causes include: viral infections (Herpes virus, HIV, hepatitis A), bacterial infections (encephalitis, meningitis, dental infections, pneumonia), parasitic diseases , immune diseases (lupus erythematosus...), endocrine disorders during pregnancy/menstrual disorders...\nThe duration of an allergic reaction also depends on the drug and the patient's reaction. Allergic reactions can occur immediately after taking the medicine, about 30 - 60 minutes, or after 3 - 14 days.\n\nSubjects susceptible to disease\nStatistics show that groups of people susceptible to Steven-Johnson syndrome include:\nChildren; Adults under 30 years old/other groups of people; Old person; The rate of men with Steven-Johnson disease is higher than that of women; The child has an infection (such as pneumonia); Adults who are using one of the above medicines or other medicines\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nAll drugs have the risk of causing allergies to varying degrees. Therefore, if after taking the medicine you see signs of itching or skin rash, you should stop taking the medicine promptly and re-examine immediately for specific advice from a doctor. This helps patients avoid the risk of facing serious complications, even death.\n\nSymptoms\nDeath is the most serious complication in cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Statistics in 2016 in Italy showed that the mortality rate due to SJS was 16.9%; due to TEN is 29.4%. In 2021, in Japan, the mortality rate is 13.6% with TEN. It is worth mentioning that these two countries both have advanced medical and resuscitation systems in the world. In addition, other complications include: sepsis, anaphylactic shock, multiple organ failure, pneumonia...(3)\n\nMethods of diagnosing SJS\nDiagnosis of Stevens-Johnson syndrome can be through the following ways:\nConsider the affected skin and mucous membranes (appearance of at least two ulcers in the skin areas surrounding the natural openings).; According to the patient's pain level; Degree of skin damage; Skin biopsy; In some cases, the doctor may prescribe blood tests to check for infection or allergies in the patient.\n\nHow is Stevens-Johnson syndrome treated?\nTreatment of Stevens-Johnson syndrome includes: (4)\nImmediately stop taking the medicine that causes the allergic reaction; Replace electrolytes with intravenous (IV) fluids; Use non-stick bandages on damaged skin; Use high-calorie foods to increase resistance to promote the healing process; Use antibiotics and antihistamines when necessary to prevent infection; Use pain relievers; Treatment in hospital/intensive care unit/burn room; The team of doctors involved in treatment may include dermatologists, intensivists, and ophthalmologists (in case of eye damage).; In some cases, treatment with IV immunoglobulin, cyclosporin, IV steroids, or amniotic membrane transplantation (for the eyes)\nPatients should increase their intake of foods that increase resistance to quickly restore health\n\nCan the disease be prevented?\nStevens-Johnson syndrome cannot be prevented because the main cause comes from oral medications. The best way to prevent this is to not use the drug that caused the allergic reaction. Because if you take that medicine a second time, there is a high risk of skin peeling, the progression will be more severe than the first allergy, and even face the risk of death.\nEach patient with Stevens-Johnson syndrome may exhibit different symptoms. The damaged skin may heal within a few weeks, but recovery can take several months if the patient has severe symptoms. Some long-term reactions may develop, including:\nSkin: dry, itchy, changes in skin color; Eyes: chronic swelling and/or dryness, chronic irritation, difficulty seeing, sensitivity to light (photophobia).; Excessive sweating.; Lung damage, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma.; Loss or deformation of nails; Hair loss (alopecia).; Dry mucous membranes, which can cause problems with urination; Chronic fatigue syndrome.; Having problems with taste\nIn addition, after being treated for Stevens-Johnson disease, patients should be careful to keep the blistered skin area clean. Clean with povidine or methylene blue if blisters are still open. If the blisters have crusted over, just keep it clean. Prioritize eating food groups that increase resistance so the body can recover quickly.\nDr. Dang Thi Ngoc Bich is the person who laid the first brick, building and promoting the work of both skin medical examination and treatment and skin aesthetics at the Tam Anh General Hospital system in Ho Chi Minh City. In particular, Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City has the advantage of modern machinery and equipment, a team of highly skilled doctors and technicians, and a convenient location for people to examine skin diseases and skin aesthetics. safe and effective.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with a Dermatologist at Tam Anh General Hospital System, you can choose from the following options:\nContact hotline 0287 102 6789 - 093 180 6858 (HCMC) or 024 3872 3872 - 024 7106 6858 (Hanoi) to register for a private examination with a specialist.; Register for an appointment at the link: https://tamanhhospital.vn/danh-cho-khach-hang/dat-lich-kham/; Send a message on Tam Anh General Hospital Fanpage.; Text message via Zalo OA of Tam Anh General Hospital.\nAlthough Stevens Johnson syndrome is quite rare, the mortality rate is quite high. Therefore, when you notice any signs of the disease, you should immediately go to the nearest hospital or medical facility for testing, diagnosis and timely treatment.",
