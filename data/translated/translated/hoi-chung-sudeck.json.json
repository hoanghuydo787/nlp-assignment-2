    "content": "Sudeck syndrome: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment\n\nSudeck syndrome is a rare condition that can occur at any age, most commonly between the ages of 40 and 60. Early detection of the disease is of great significance for treatment. When treated promptly, most patients will control their symptoms well, reducing many of the negative impacts of this syndrome on their health.\n\nWhat is Sudeck syndrome?\nSudeck syndrome or sympathetic dystrophic pain is a condition of pain and dystrophy due to dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to severe bone calcium loss, causing reduced mobility. The disease has typical symptoms such as burning pain, swelling of the limbs, skin disorders such as skin atrophy, increased sweating, and signs of vasomotor disorders.\n\nCauses of dystrophic pain\nMechanism of dystrophic pain syndrome: When there are frequent, chronic painful stimuli from the peripheral area, sympathetic nerve reflexes in the spinal cord area are likely to be disturbed. Because this sympathetic nerve area is disturbed, it causes sympathetic disorders in the peripheral area.\nSudeck syndrome often occurs after a triggering cause. Common causes include:\nShoulder, hand, neck injuries; diseases of the shoulder joint; cervical spine degeneration; Knee injury or after arthroscopic knee surgery; After performing surgery.; Carpal tunnel syndrome, myocardial infarction, stroke and breast cancer; Are using tuberculosis treatment drugs and barbiturates.\nWhen a fracture of the lower end of the radius or a fracture of the lower 1/3 of the forearm is not treated and anatomically perfectly adjusted, the patient is likely to have a misaligned cal. The misaligned cal position causes compression of the neurovascular bundle in the wrist, stimulating chronic pain. This is the trigger for Sudeck syndrome.\n\nSymptoms of Sudeck syndrome\nThe skin at the injury site will become smoother and lose wrinkles. When moving, the patient feels pain. The pain is not specific to a specific part but spreads almost throughout the injured limb. At that time, the joints are limited in movement. Due to movement, the limb will become swollen, hot, and red even though there are no signs of infection.\nThe pain appears continuously. This is considered a complication of a fracture or injury. However, the time this condition appeared was relatively late. Sudeck syndrome often occurs in a number of locations including the hands, fingers, feet and ankles, and shoulder area. Some other symptoms patients may face include:\nChanges in skin color: Sometimes dark red, sometimes pale or purple; Skin temperature is sometimes hotter and sometimes colder than the opposite side; Sweating is more than normal in the early stages, then it dries up again.; In the late stages, the body experiences problems such as muscle atrophy, dry rough nails, and brittle cracks; Hair grows strongly at first and then falls out.\nUpper limb dystrophic pain syndrome\nThis condition starts slowly and gradually increases. Some cases may have a sudden and rapid onset. Shoulder-hand syndrome goes through 2 stages:\nProlonged swelling phase: This phase lasts from several weeks to several months. The hand and part of the forearm hurt a lot and had many obstacles when moving. Swelling appears in the hand and part of the forearm. The skin is shiny, pinkish red, gradually turning purple, slightly wet, and hot to the touch. Joints and muscles are stiff and difficult to move. Shoulder pain, limited range of motion from mild to severe. The shoulder is completely immobilized; Atrophy phase: Pain gradually decreases, swelling decreases but atrophy gradually. The hands are atrophied, the skin is thin, smooth, purple in color, the hair falls out, the fingers curl up and are difficult to stretch, the wrists bend, and the hands are severely stiff. The shoulder is almost motionless, frozen but not painful. The above damage is likely to be permanent and irreversible.\nLower limb dystrophic pain syndrome\nAfter the trigger, the patient feels pain in his legs. The pain gradually increases, causing the patient to have to use a cane to move. The foot can be simply painful, or the entire foot can be paralyzed. X-ray results showed scattered osteoporosis.\nIn addition, patients may experience leg pain and swelling. The leg is paralyzed and cannot move, the whole foot is swollen, red and hot like inflammation, range of motion is limited due to pain and swelling. X-ray results showed total osteoporosis.\nAt the knee joint, there are many types of damage including severe swelling that is easily confused with knee arthritis, knee effusion, leg muscle atrophy, knee stiffness, thigh and leg muscle atrophy, and mild pain. At the hip joint, the patient feels pain, limited range of motion, and thigh muscle atrophy. X-ray results showed bone thinning and gradually increasing osteoporosis in the hip joint.\nDystrophic pain in the legs will be well controlled when treated promptly and properly, rarely leaving sequelae. The average time from the onset of the disease to good control of the disease condition for the foot is 12 months, 7 months for the knee joint and 5 months for the hip joint.\n\nDiagnosis of dystrophic pain caused by sympathetic nerves\nIf you notice signs of this condition, patients should quickly go to medical facilities for examination and treatment. The doctor will rely on clinical signs and some imaging test results to determine the correct condition and provide appropriate treatment. Clinical signs include:\nPain at many different levels: Patients feel pain ranging from tingling to burning or electric shock.; The pain gradually increases, with episodes of intense pain like a burn, changing with the weather and emotions. If the patient passively or actively moves the joints, the pain will increase.; Initial loss of function leads to stiffness due to fibrosis in the joint.; The affected area is initially edematous and then gradually has muscle atrophy, with fibrous adhesion at the joints.; There are signs of vascular disorders.\nThere is no specific test to diagnose the condition. Doctors may prescribe patients:\nMRI scan: Scan results help doctors observe and identify abnormalities inside the body, especially changes in tissues; X-ray: The results of the scan help doctors determine mineral loss in the bones. X-rays are often indicated in the later stages of the disease.; Sweat test: The doctor will check to see if one side of the body sweats more than the other; Temperature check: The doctor will check the temperature or blood flow at the site of injury compared to other locations in the body.\n\nTreatment of Sudeck syndrome\nCurrently, there is no cure for Sudeck syndrome. Doctors just stop at relieving the patient's symptoms. Some medications that doctors may recommend patients use as anesthetic creams include:\nLidocaine;; Antidepressants;; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs);; Anticonvulsants (pain treatment);; Corticosteroid medications such as methylprednisolone or prednisolone (to treat swelling);; Nasal spray to prevent bone loss;; Nerve blocking injections; ​; Pain relievers such as oxycodone morphine,; Hydrocodone and fentanyl;; Over-the-counter medications such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen (pain relievers).\nSome other treatments that can relieve symptoms include:\nPlace electrodes on the spinal cord, causing small electric shocks to relieve pain for the patient.; Instruct patients to practice physical therapy to help move more easily and improve pain; Conduct psychological therapy, guide patients on appropriate relaxation methods; The brace helps reduce pain at the injury site.\nWhen the pain does not improve, even when treating Sudeck syndrome with the above methods, the patient may be prescribed sympathectomy surgery. During surgery, the doctor will remove certain nerves around blood vessels to help improve blood flow.\nCenter for Orthopedic Trauma, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is where a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons gather such as: TTND.Prof.Dr.Nguyen Viet Tien; Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa; Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh; MSc. Tran Anh Vu; Dr. Do Tien Dung; Dr. BS.CK II Vu Huu Dung... This is also one of the pioneer units in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal diseases with modern techniques according to the world's leading advanced protocols.\nThe hospital is also equipped with a system of modern machinery and imaging equipment such as: Somatom Drive 768-slice CT scanner, new generation magnetic resonance machine Magnetom Amira BioMatrix, bone density measuring machine, ultrasound machine. minus…; Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss surgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table... to be able to detect injuries early and successfully surgically treat musculoskeletal diseases...\nTam Anh General Hospital also owns a spacious clinic system and high-class boarding area; modern rehabilitation area; Comprehensive post-operative care process helps patients quickly recover and stabilize their health after surgery.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Orthopedics Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nSudeck syndrome has a complicated progression, symptoms gradually increase, leading to dangerous complications such as loss of functional movement in the area of ​​injury and disability. When detecting signs of illness, patients need to quickly go to medical facilities for examination and appropriate treatment.",
