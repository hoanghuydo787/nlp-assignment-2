    "content": "What is immunodeficiency syndrome? Causes and symptoms\n\nImmune deficiency syndrome progresses silently but causes serious consequences. Checking your health, building a proper diet, resting, and exercising will help you improve your health and prevent common diseases. However, in many cases, it is necessary to have a health check-up at a medical facility for doctors to diagnose and treat promptly. Expert advice on articles: Doctor Pham Manh Hoan - Expert advisor to Tam Anh General Hospital.\n\nWhat is immunodeficiency syndrome?\nImmunodeficiency syndrome (Immune deficiency disorder) is a condition in which the body's immunity is impaired, leading to the body's inability to prevent and protect against attacks from microbial pathogens from external factors such as bacteria, viruses, mold, parasites...(1)\n\nClassification of immunodeficiency syndromes\n1. Primary immunodeficiency disease\nMany people are born with some immune defense system missing or an ineffective immune system that makes them susceptible to infection. This is primary immunodeficiency. (2)\nPatients with basic symptoms such as infections last longer and are more difficult to treat than some people with normal immune systems. They can also get infections that normal people don't get (opportunistic infections). However, signs and symptoms also vary depending on the type of immunodeficiency disorder and each person's constitution.\n2. Secondary immunodeficiency disease\nSecondary immunodeficiency is formed during development, symptoms are often easier to detect... There are many causes of secondary immunity including:\nChronic diseases (diabetes, kidney failure, cancer, etc.): chronic diseases cause the body to ineffectively synthesize nutrients that participate in the metabolic process to create antibodies against microorganisms. foreign bacteria. At the same time, chemotherapy and radiotherapy for cancer using corticosteroid drugs cause side effects that weaken the immune system.; In patients with injuries requiring spleen removal, the risk of infection is higher.; Drug addiction, HIV infection: lymphocytes are destroyed, reducing immunity, causing the body to increase the risk of infection, which can initially cause fever, then gradually worsen with damage to the brain and nervous system. genital, kidney, heart, cognitive impairment, etc. HIV infection can be diagnosed with antibody or antigen tests.; Staying in the hospital for a long time: physical inactivity, loss of appetite, worries about illness, hospital bills... are common problems when staying in the hospital for a long time. The combination of health problems and psychological fatigue causes cells to gradually become ineffective, leading to a weakened immune system.; Organ transplantation: in the postoperative period, immunosuppressive drugs play a key role in the success of organ transplantation. However, they inhibit all immune responses and contribute to post-transplant complications including: cancer cell growth, increased risk of cardiovascular disease and even death from uncontrolled infections. controllable.\nChronic disease is one of the causes of a weakened immune system\nMalnutrition: nutrition plays an important role for a healthy body. A long-term diet lacking nutrients, especially protein, can weaken the body's immune system.\nIn addition, aging cells over time lead to organ failure and synthesis of nutrients that do not meet the body's needs, making people susceptible to immunodeficiency. Especially in the elderly, the immune tissue system (such as the pituitary gland) shrinks, the number and white blood cells decrease, so the immune system is no longer effective, making it difficult to protect the body from pathogens. harmful.\n3. Common variegated immunodeficiency (CVID)\nIt is a basic immune system disorder, due to defects in a number of different but often unclear components, including humoral immunity. People with CVID have signs similar to agammaglobulinemia linked to genetic mutations on the X chromosome in developing infections, but onset tends to be later (usually between 20 and 40 years of age). (3)\n4. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)\nA primary disorder involving a combined deficiency of humoral and cellular immunity due to mutations in any one of many different genes. Most of these defects are autosomal recessive.\nMost children from birth to 6 years of age with combined immunodeficiency often have candida, persistent viral infections, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and diarrhea that slow growth. In addition, children may have exfoliative dermatitis, bone abnormalities, etc. If not detected early, SCID will cause death for the child.\n5. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD)\nThis is a primary immunodeficiency disorder associated with phagocytic cell defects. More than 50% of CGD cases occur in men due to X-linked recessive inheritance. In CGD, leukocytes do not produce hydrogen peroxide, superoxide and O2 complex activators because of the lack of NDAPH activity. oxidase causes the bactericidal function of phagocytic cells to fail. Therefore, bacteria and fungi do not die despite normal phagocytosis.\nChronic granulomatous disease often begins with recurrent abscesses during childhood. Many granulomatous lesions occur in the lungs, liver, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, and urinary tract. In addition, it also causes other problems such as pneumonia, lymphadenitis, anal abscess, stomatitis, and osteomyelitis.\nA weakened immune system makes you susceptible to bacterial and viral infections\n\nSymptoms of immune system deficiency disease\nWeakened immune system makes the body unable to protect itself against attacks from bacteria and viruses, making it susceptible to infection. Even inflammatory diseases that normal people are not infected with can still be contracted by people with weakened immune systems. People with immunodeficiency disorders are susceptible to infections, they experience inflammation from time to time, such as:\nPink eyes; Sinusitis; Oral thrush; Cold; Gingivitis; Pneumonia; Yeast infection.\n\nThe cause is a weakened immune system\nThe body's immune system includes the following organs: spleen, tonsils, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. Proteins and blood cells are also part of the immune system, helping to protect the body from harmful agents. When detecting an attacking agent, the body will produce antibodies to destroy the pathogens. During this process, some white blood cells engulf and destroy bacteria and other foreign materials. Additional proteins also support this process.\nWhen the immune system is weakened, white blood cells and especially T and B lymphocytes function abnormally, the body does not produce enough antibodies, causing harmful agents such as cancer cells, bacteria, Viruses and parasites attack strongly, causing the body to gradually weaken.\n\nSymptoms\nPrimary immunodeficiency is caused by genetic defects and is difficult to detect, often occurring in children with a variety of symptoms depending on the type they have. Even if not detected and treated promptly, the patient can easily die. Meanwhile, with secondary immunodeficiency, the body gradually loses the ability to defend itself or is weak in defense against harmful agents, causing health to gradually weaken.\n\nDiagnostic method\nWhen you notice that you are susceptible to illness and require prolonged treatment, you should go to a reputable medical facility to check whether you have immunodeficiency syndrome or not. The doctor will ask about your medical history, perform a physical exam, determine the number of white blood cells, T cells and immune levels to make an accurate diagnosis. If a T-cell abnormality is suspected, doctors may perform a skin test. Through this, small amounts of proteins from common infectious organisms (yeast) are injected just under the skin. If there is no reaction (swelling or redness) within 2 days, this may be a sign of disease caused by T cell abnormalities.\nYour doctor may also perform blood tests to determine your risk of genetic mutations that cause immunodeficiency disorders.\n\nHow to treat immunodeficiency?\nBased on the body's immunodeficiency status, the doctor will have appropriate treatment methods. Treatment is usually to prevent infection, treat infection, and enhance and improve the function of organs in the immune system. (4)\nDoctors may use antibiotics, antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir, acyclovir, interferon and immunoglobulin therapy to treat immune deficiency disorders.\nIn cases where the bone marrow does not produce enough lymphocytes, the doctor may request a bone marrow transplant to treat the disease.\nBased on the cause of the weakened immune system, the doctor will have appropriate treatment methods\n\nCan the disease be prevented?\nPrimary immunodeficiency syndrome is genetic so there is no way to prevent it, however, you can monitor your child for early detection, control and treatment. Meanwhile, secondary immunodeficiency can be prevented through reducing risk factors, lifestyle choices, and a healthy diet. You can do the following to improve your immune system and prevent infections:\nToilet\nClean your body every day, wash your hands thoroughly with soap after going to the toilet and before eating. At the same time, disinfect and sanitize the living and working environment, ensuring a clean and airy living space, preventing pathogens and viruses.\nTake care of your teeth at least twice a day, regularly gargle with salt water to kill bacteria, and protect the body's first immune organ.\nDiet\nBuild a healthy diet with foods that are safe for your health. You should eat all kinds of foods: vegetables. meat, fish, fruit,... to balance nutrition and prevent chronic diseases.\nPhysical enhancement\nExercising to release the body is an important activity but is forgotten by many people. Not only does it help you have a toned and slim figure, physical activity helps you have better physical strength, enhances your body's metabolism, thereby preventing common infections. However, if you are sick, you should consult your doctor for exercises suitable for your health and condition. Because the exertion during exercise also causes health deterioration, increasing the risk of infection.\nStress management\nSleep plays an important role in helping your body rest and restore strength after a long day of work. However, modern life with many worries and pressures makes it difficult for many people to get good sleep, leading to many health problems such as chronic diseases and infections. Therefore, you should take good care of your sleep, try to go to bed and wake up at a fixed time every day to ensure your body rests and reduces stress. Prolonged stress has a major impact on your immune system. Massage therapies, meditation, yoga, etc. will help you get rid of stress, improve your mental health, and avoid common infections.\nFace mask\nMasks are a common measure to protect you from flu-causing agents as well as common viruses. Even if you don't feel safe wearing a mask, you can limit contact with people who have the flu or other infections to limit infection.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has made people more aware of wearing masks. You should choose for yourself medical masks from reputable manufacturers. If you use a cloth mask, you should clean the mask and change it regularly to avoid pathogens from accumulating, growing and causing acute respiratory diseases.\nVaccine\nVaccines are a specific method that helps your body produce antibodies against harmful viruses.\nSpecifically, during the Covid-19 pandemic, vaccination with a full dose of vaccine helps alleviate symptoms and recover quickly. However, many people cannot receive the Covid-19 vaccine due to a history of severe allergies to any component of the vaccine; Conditions causing moderate to severe immunodeficiency syndrome such as: organ cancer or malignant blood diseases under active treatment, anti-rejection treatment after organ transplantation, primary immune deficiency diseases moderate and severe (DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich..),…\nCurrently, advances in medicine have given them the opportunity to use Evusheld monoclonal antibodies to prevent Covid-19, reducing the risk of infection and hospitalization. Tam Anh General Hospital system pioneered the world's first licensed AstraZeneca monoclonal antibody for Covid-19 prophylaxis to Vietnam, promptly protecting vulnerable groups of people against Covid-19 due to depression syndrome. decreased immunity.",
