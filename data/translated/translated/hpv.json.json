About 15 cases are considered \"high risk\" because they have the potential to lead to the most dangerous diseases in women such as cervical, vaginal, vulvar cancer, etc.\nHPV virus is the leading cause of cervical cancer\n\nWhat is HPV?\nHPV is the abbreviation for Human Papilloma Virus - the virus that causes papillomas in humans. There are about 100 types of HPV that affect different parts of the body. About 40 types of HPV can cause genital tract diseases including: vulva, vagina, cervix, penis, scrotum, as well as rectum and anus, etc. Among them, about 15 types are considered is at “high risk” for cervical cancer. (first)\nInfections caused by the HPV virus are often transmitted sexually or through skin-to-skin contact. Vaccination is an effective measure to help protect against HPV strains that can cause genital warts or cervical cancer.\n\nHow many strains of HPV are there?\nScientists have identified more than 100 different strains of HPV virus. Most of them are harmless, have no symptoms, and go away without treatment.\nThere are more than 40 strains of HPV virus that can cause genital and anal infections. Of these, 15 high-risk HPV strains are capable of causing various cancers, from cervical, anal to other genital cancers. Less dangerous strains can cause warts on the hands, feet (especially the soles), genital warts, etc. Some common HPV strains include:\nHPV 6 and HPV 11\nThese are low-risk HPV strains. They are involved in about 90% of genital warts. HPV 11 can also cause changes to the cervix.\nHPV vaccination is an effective way to prevent HPV 6 and HPV 11. Studies show the vaccine is 89-99% effective against HPV 6 and HPV 11 in people aged 9-26 years.\nIf you have HPV 6 or HPV 11, your doctor will prescribe medications such as imiquimod (Aldara, Zyclara) or podofilox (Condylox). These are topical medications that destroy genital wart tissue.\nHPV 16 and HPV 18\nHPV 16 is a high-risk HPV strain and usually does not cause any noticeable symptoms. This is the cause of cervical cancer - the most common cancer in women.\nHPV 18 is another high-risk HPV strain. Like HPV 16, it usually causes no symptoms but can lead to cervical cancer.\nHPV 16 and HPV 18 are the cause of about 70% of cervical cancer cases worldwide. HPV vaccination is a way to protect you against these two strains of HPV. (2)\n\nIs HPV contagious?\nAccording to Dr. Vu Huu Khiem, human papilloma virus (HPV) is very contagious. However, HPV is not transmitted through bodily fluids such as semen or saliva, but rather through skin-to-skin contact. This is most likely to happen during sexual intercourse, such as vaginal, anal, and oral sex. Infection can also occur if HPV comes into contact with mucous membranes (in the mouth, lips, anus, parts of the genital organs) or breaks in the skin, such as vaginal tears.\nIt is estimated that most sexually active people will be infected with HPV at some point. Condoms, when used correctly, help reduce the risk of HPV infection.\n\nSigns of HPV infection\nA body infected with the HPV virus will form warts in many different forms, depending on the type of HPV: (3)\nGenital warts: Appear as painless bumps that secrete fluid and cause itching. In women, genital warts mainly appear on the vulva but can also be found near the anus, on the cervix or in the vagina. In men, genital warts form on the penis and scrotum or around the anus.; Common warts: Appear on hands and fingers as rough, raised bumps. In most cases, this type of wart is only unsightly, but sometimes causes pain or bleeding.; Plantar warts: These are hard, rough warts, often appearing on the heels or soles of the feet, causing discomfort and itching.; Flat warts: These are warts with flat, slightly raised heads. They can appear anywhere. Children often get it on the face, women get it on their legs, and men tend to get it in the beard area.\nWarts caused by HPV infection can appear in many forms in many parts such as: Hands, feet, genitals,...\n\nCauses of HPV infection\nDr. Vu Huu Khiem said, HPV infection occurs when the virus enters the body, usually through an open wound on the skin. Meanwhile, genital HPV virus is transmitted through sexual contact (including vaginal sex, anal sex and other skin-to-skin contact in the genital area).\nIf you are pregnant and have HPV in the form of genital warts, your baby is at high risk of infection.\nWarts are very contagious. You will be easily infected by direct contact with warts or touching objects containing the HPV virus that causes warts.\nRisk factors for HPV infection include:\nHaving multiple sexual partners: The more sexual partners you have, the higher your risk of genital HPV infection. Not only that, having sex with someone who has many partners also increases the risk of getting the disease.; Age: Common warts occur mainly in children, while genital warts occur more commonly in adolescents and young adults.; Weakened immune system: People with weakened immune systems are more likely to be infected with HPV. The cause of weakening the immune system can be HIV/AIDS or immunosuppressant drugs (often used after organ transplant).; Damaged skin: Areas of skin that are exposed or have scratches are more susceptible to developing common warts.; Having unsafe contact: Touching another person's warts or not wearing protective clothing before coming into contact with surfaces that contain the HPV virus – such as public showers, swimming pools – can increase the risk. risk of HPV infection.\n\nWhat diseases can HPV cause?\nIf you are infected with the HPV virus and do not treat it completely, you are likely to experience complications such as:\nDamage to the mouth and upper respiratory tract\nSome HPV infections cause lesions on the tongue, tonsils, palate, larynx, and nose.\nCervical cancer\nNearly all cases of cervical cancer are caused by infection with the HPV virus. However, it takes 10-20 years or longer after infection with this virus for cervical cancer to develop. Vaccination to prevent HPV infection is the most effective way to protect yourself against this dangerous disease. (4)\nSymptoms of early-stage cervical cancer can be similar to other genital tract infections, so they are easy to ignore. Therefore, women need to be screened with regular cervical cell tests to detect abnormalities in the cervix that can lead to cancer. Experts recommend that women 21 - 29 years old should have a Pap test every 3 years, women 30 - 65 years old should continue to have a Pap test every 3 years or every 5 years if they have an HPV DNA test. same time. Women over 65 years old can stop testing if they have had 3 normal Pap tests in a row or 2 HPV DNA and Pap tests have shown no abnormal results.\nIn addition to cervical cancer, a number of other types of cancer have a precursor to the HPV virus including anal cancer, penile cancer, vulvar cancer, vaginal cancer,...\n\nMethod for diagnosing HPV virus infection\nThe following testing methods are often prescribed to diagnose HPV infection:\n1. Pap Smear test (also known as Pap test, cervical cancer smear test)\nThis is a cytological test to collect and analyze cells in the cervix, detecting structural and morphological abnormalities such as metaplasia, dysplasia, etc., which are the seeds of cancer cells, thereby helps detect disease early. Besides, some cervical cells are also used to test for HPV.\nTo perform this test, the doctor will use a speculum to gently insert it into the vagina, expanding and fixing the vaginal wall so that the cervix area can be clearly seen.\nNext, the doctor will use a wooden stick to take a sample from the cervix. These cells are spread onto half of the glass slide in the opaque part, spread thinly and in a single direction, gently and meticulously to avoid cell damage as well as cell clumping. Continue spreading cells on the remaining half of the slide, rotating the brush along the length of the slide. Place the second smear on top of the first smear, send to the laboratory to analyze the results.\nThis process lasts a few minutes and is usually painless. After taking the test sample, the woman may feel discomfort or light vaginal bleeding. This condition rarely occurs, but if it persists, you should immediately notify your doctor for timely intervention and treatment.\n2. Thinprep test\nThinprep is an improved cervical smear test compared to the Pap Smear test. To take a test sample, the doctor will use a cytology brush to take cell samples from the cervical area. Therefore, the amount of cells collected will be greater. The cells were washed in fixative and placed in Thinprep vials, then stored and brought to the laboratory. The specimen is processed completely automatically by extracting and spreading cells onto the glass slide. Finally, the Pathologist will conduct analysis and provide results.\n3. HPV DNA test\nHPV DNA testing uses an automatic DNA extraction system and modern technology to accurately analyze and determine the presence of HPV virus. This method does not confirm 100% whether women have cervical cancer or not, but based on the results obtained, it can detect the disease-causing virus existing in the body, thereby assessing the risk of disease. in the future to take effective preventive measures.\nUsually, the HPV DNA test is performed at the same time as the Pap Smear test or Thinprep test to detect and evaluate abnormal cells at risk of causing cancer early.\n4. Notes when performing HPV virus diagnostic testing\nIn order for the process of diagnosing HPV infection to yield accurate results, women need to remember important notes before performing the tests, including:\nDo not use vaginal lubricants within 24 hours before the test.; Do not perform the test during menstrual days because it may affect the quality of the sample collected. The most appropriate time for testing is at least 5 days after menstruation; Do not take the test within 48 - 72 hours after sexual intercourse.; Do not douche or affect the vaginal area within 2-3 days before the test.; You should immediately notify the doctor who ordered the test if you are taking medication or are in the process of treating a gynecological infection.\n\nTreatment of HPV infection\nIn many cases, HPV infection will go away on its own without any treatment. In fact, about 70 - 90% of people infected with HPV have their immune system clear the virus from their bodies.\nWhen treatment is needed, the goal is to relieve symptoms by removing warts as well as abnormal cells in the cervix. Treatment is usually:\nCryosurgery: Freeze the wart with liquid nitrogen.; Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP): Uses a special loop of wire to remove abnormal cells.; Electrocautery: Burning warts with electric current; Laser therapy: Uses high-intensity light to destroy warts and abnormal cells.; Topical medication: Apply medicated cream directly to the wart (be careful not to use non-prescribed wart treatments on the genitals).\n\nPrevent HPV infection\nUsing condoms correctly every time you have sex can help reduce your risk of HPV infection. However, condoms do not cover the entire genital skin. So it is not 100% effective in protecting you from the spread of HPV. People with genital warts should not have sex until the warts are completely removed.\nUsing condoms during sex helps reduce the risk of HPV infection\nSome other ways to reduce your risk of HPV infection include:\nHave safe sex, avoid having sex with multiple partners at the same time; Women should have a Pap/Thinprep/HPV DNA test annually or every 3 years to detect early abnormal changes in the cervix - signs of pre-cancer.; Men and women should stop having sex as soon as they know or think they have genital warts, then need to see a doctor and get thorough treatment.; Vaccination against HPV: In Vietnam, vaccines are circulating to prevent cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, pre-cancerous and dysplastic lesions, genital warts and diseases caused by HPV virus infection. The vaccine is indicated for women aged 9 - 26 years old, regardless of whether they have ever had sex or not. In addition, boys during puberty can also be vaccinated with this vaccine to prevent the risk of HPV infection leading to nasopharyngeal cancer, mouth cancer, tongue cancer, and male genital tract cancer (anus, penis,…).; Regular health screening to detect damage caused by HPV virus infection early.\n\nFrequently asked questions about HPV\n1. Is the HPV virus common?\nHPV is the name of a very common group of viruses. There are more than 100 strains of HPV. It is estimated that about 8 in 10 people will be infected with HPV at some point in their lives. However, it usually does not cause any symptoms and most people will never know they have it. HPV infection does not mean you will definitely get cancer.\n2. Does HPV infection during pregnancy affect the fetus?\nWomen who contract HPV during pregnancy may worry that the virus could harm the fetus, but in most cases it will not affect the developing baby. At the same time, no link was found between HPV and miscarriage, premature birth or other pregnancy complications.\nBesides, the risk of transmitting HPV to the baby during birth is very low. Most babies born to a woman with genital warts do not experience complications related to HPV. In rare cases, babies born to women with genital warts will develop throat warts. This serious condition is called respiratory papilloma, and your child may have laser surgery to prevent the warts from blocking their airways.\nIf the mother is infected with a strain of HPV virus that causes cervical cancer, the baby can still be born safely.\n3. Can HPV infection go away on its own?\nNot all human HPV infections are the same. It is necessary to distinguish between low-risk HPV leading to genital warts and high-risk HPV leading to pre-cancerous and cancerous cells. Usually, HPV goes away on its own without causing health problems. For most people with healthy immune systems, HPV will clear up on its own within 1-2 years. In the following cases, HPV may not go away on its own:\nYou are immunosuppressed - including people with HIV/AIDS or undergoing organ transplants using immunosuppressant drugs, with diseases requiring long-term high-dose corticosteroid treatment...; If you have low-risk HPV and the virus doesn't go away on its own, it can turn into genital warts. In that case, you need to be treated by cutting or burning them off.; If you have high-risk HPV, it will change the cells of the cervix, penis, anus or mouth, thereby developing pre-cancerous cells. If they are not controlled, monitored or treated, they will eventually lead to cancer several years later. This happens in about 10% of people infected with HPV.\n4. Does HPV cause cancer?\nCervical cancer is a common cancer in women related to the HPV virus. Most cases of cervical cancer are caused by this virus. In addition, vaginal cancer, vulvar cancer, penile cancer and anal cancer also originate from the HPV virus. HPV also increases the risk of oral and throat cancer. However, these types of cancer are less common.\n5. Who should get the HPV vaccine?\nHPV vaccination is recommended for ages 9-26. HPV vaccination in this age group offers more benefits, because many people have never been exposed to the HPV virus. To know whether you should get the HPV vaccine or not, you should consult your doctor for advice about the risk of new HPV infections as well as the benefits of getting vaccinated.

Pap Smear test (also known as Pap test, cervical cancer smear test)\nThis is a cytological test to collect and analyze cells in the cervix, detecting structural and morphological abnormalities such as metaplasia, dysplasia, etc., which are the seeds of cancer cells, thereby helps detect disease early. Besides, some cervical cells are also used to test for HPV.\nTo perform this test, the doctor will use a speculum to gently insert it into the vagina, expanding and fixing the vaginal wall so that the cervix area can be clearly seen.\nNext, the doctor will use a wooden stick to take a sample from the cervix. These cells are spread onto half of the glass slide in the opaque part, spread thinly and in a single direction, gently and meticulously to avoid cell damage as well as cell clumping. Continue spreading cells on the remaining half of the slide, rotating the brush along the length of the slide. Place the second smear on top of the first smear, send to the laboratory to analyze the results.\nThis process lasts a few minutes and is usually painless. After taking the test sample, the woman may feel discomfort or light vaginal bleeding. This condition rarely occurs, but if it persists, you should immediately notify your doctor for timely intervention and treatment.\n2. Thinprep test\nThinprep is an improved cervical smear test compared to the Pap Smear test. To take a test sample, the doctor will use a cytology brush to take cell samples from the cervical area. Therefore, the amount of cells collected will be greater. The cells were washed in fixative and placed in Thinprep vials, then stored and brought to the laboratory. The specimen is processed completely automatically by extracting and spreading cells onto the glass slide. Finally, the Pathologist will conduct analysis and provide results.\n3. HPV DNA test\nHPV DNA testing uses an automatic DNA extraction system and modern technology to accurately analyze and determine the presence of HPV virus. This method does not confirm 100% whether women have cervical cancer or not, but based on the results obtained, it can detect the disease-causing virus existing in the body, thereby assessing the risk of disease. in the future to take effective preventive measures.\nUsually, the HPV DNA test is performed at the same time as the Pap Smear test or Thinprep test to detect and evaluate abnormal cells at risk of causing cancer early.\n4. Notes when performing HPV virus diagnostic testing\nIn order for the process of diagnosing HPV infection to yield accurate results, women need to remember important notes before performing the tests, including:\nDo not use vaginal lubricants within 24 hours before the test.; Do not perform the test during menstrual days because it may affect the quality of the sample collected. The most appropriate time for testing is at least 5 days after menstruation; Do not take the test within 48 - 72 hours after sexual intercourse.; Do not douche or affect the vaginal area within 2-3 days before the test.; You should immediately notify the doctor who ordered the test if you are taking medication or are in the process of treating a gynecological infection."

In fact, about 70 - 90% of people infected with HPV have their immune system clear the virus from their bodies.\nWhen treatment is needed, the goal is to relieve symptoms by removing warts as well as abnormal cells in the cervix. Treatment is usually:\nCryosurgery: Freeze the wart with liquid nitrogen.; Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP): Uses a special loop of wire to remove abnormal cells.; Electrocautery: Burning warts with electric current; Laser therapy: Uses high-intensity light to destroy warts and abnormal cells.; Topical medication: Apply medicated cream directly to the wart (be careful not to use non-prescribed wart treatments on the genitals).",

            "subsection_content": "1. Is the HPV virus common?\nHPV is the name of a very common group of viruses. There are more than 100 strains of HPV. It is estimated that about 8 in 10 people will be infected with HPV at some point in their lives. However, it usually does not cause any symptoms and most people will never know they have it. HPV infection does not mean you will definitely get cancer.\n2. Does HPV infection during pregnancy affect the fetus?\nWomen who contract HPV during pregnancy may worry that the virus could harm the fetus, but in most cases it will not affect the developing baby. At the same time, no link was found between HPV and miscarriage, premature birth or other pregnancy complications.\nBesides, the risk of transmitting HPV to the baby during birth is very low. Most babies born to a woman with genital warts do not experience complications related to HPV. In rare cases, babies born to women with genital warts will develop throat warts. This serious condition is called respiratory papilloma, and your child may have laser surgery to prevent the warts from blocking their airways.\nIf the mother is infected with a strain of HPV virus that causes cervical cancer, the baby can still be born safely.\n3. Can HPV infection go away on its own?\nNot all human HPV infections are the same. It is necessary to distinguish between low-risk HPV leading to genital warts and high-risk HPV leading to pre-cancerous and cancerous cells. Usually, HPV goes away on its own without causing health problems. For most people with healthy immune systems, HPV will clear up on its own within 1-2 years. In the following cases, HPV may not go away on its own:\nYou are immunosuppressed - including people with HIV/AIDS or undergoing organ transplants using immunosuppressant drugs, with diseases requiring long-term high-dose corticosteroid treatment...; If you have low-risk HPV and the virus doesn't go away on its own, it can turn into genital warts. In that case, you need to be treated by cutting or burning them off.; If you have high-risk HPV, it will change the cells of the cervix, penis, anus or mouth, thereby developing pre-cancerous cells. If they are not controlled, monitored or treated, they will eventually lead to cancer several years later. This happens in about 10% of people infected with HPV.\n4. Does HPV cause cancer?\nCervical cancer is a common cancer in women related to the HPV virus. Most cases of cervical cancer are caused by this virus. In addition, vaginal cancer, vulvar cancer, penile cancer and anal cancer also originate from the HPV virus. HPV also increases the risk of oral and throat cancer. However, these types of cancer are less common.\n5. Who should get the HPV vaccine?\nHPV vaccination is recommended for ages 9-26. HPV vaccination in this age group offers more benefits, because many people have never been exposed to the HPV virus. To know whether you should get the HPV vaccine or not, you should consult your doctor for advice about the risk of new HPV infections as well as the benefits of getting vaccinated. (5)",
