    "content": "Hoarseness (hoarseness): Causes, symptoms and treatments\n\nHoarseness often occurs when shouting, talking too much or when you have a sore throat. But if the hoarseness has no clear cause and lasts more than 2 weeks, it could be a warning sign of an underlying health condition, such as laryngeal cancer, and you need to go to the hospital for examination - Doctor. CKII Tran Thi Thuy Hang - Head of ENT Department, Tam Anh General Hospital said.\n\nWhat is hoarseness?\nHoarseness (hoarseness) is a condition in which the voice changes, the sound is no longer clear and you often have to try to make sounds. This condition can go away on its own within a few days, but if it lasts more than two weeks for unknown reasons, you should go to the hospital for examination to prevent the risk of vocal cord damage or laryngeal cancer.\n\nWho is at risk for hoarseness (hoarseness)?\nHoarseness is very common, it is estimated that about 1/3 of the world's population experiences hoarseness at least once in their life.\nHoarseness can occur in both adults and children. However, in people who often have to use their voice continuously or at high volume, such as teachers, singers, coaches, etc., the risk of hoarseness is higher.\nIn addition, people with flu, sore throat, and cough often have laryngitis, which also causes hoarseness. In addition, hoarseness can also be a functional disorder that is not related to physical damage to the vocal cords.\n\nCauses of hoarseness\nSome of the most common known causes of hoarseness include:(1)\nTalking too much and too loudly: If you talk too long, cheer too loudly, sing too much, or speak at a higher pitch than usual, you may develop a hoarse voice.; Talking too much and too loudly: If you talk too long, cheer too loudly, sing too much, or speak at a higher pitch than usual, you can develop a hoarse voice.\nPhoto: Singers and MCs are people who are prone to hoarseness.\nAge: As you get older, the structure of the vocal cords degenerates and becomes less elastic, reducing vocal cord vibrations, making your voice more hoarse. Drink alcohol: Drinking too much alcohol can also cause hoarseness. Cold, sore throat, cough, sinus infection: When you have the flu, cough, sore throat or sinus infection, hoarseness will occur but may go away after you recover. Laryngitis: Allergies, colds or upper respiratory infections can cause the vocal cords to become congested, swollen and cause hoarseness. Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD): When too much stomach acid goes up into the throat, it causes laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Laryngeal reflux will damage the larynx and make your voice hoarse. Cysts and polyps: If there are benign polyps and cysts on the vocal cords, they will make your voice hoarse. Vocal cord paralysis: Vocal cord paralysis can lead to hoarseness. Causes of vocal cord paralysis can be due to trauma, cancer of the thyroid gland and mediastinum, infection, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and Parkinson's disease. Laryngeal cancer: Hoarseness that lasts more than 3 weeks without improvement after drug treatment can be one of the symptoms of laryngeal cancer. Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP/laryngeal papillomatosis): This disease causes non-cancerous tumors in the airways that cause hoarseness, the tumors are benign but easily recur. Dyspnea and voice disorders due to muscle tension: Excessive muscle tension in and around the larynx will prevent the vocal cords from opening and closing effectively.; Age: As you get older, the structure of the vocal cords degenerates and becomes less elastic, reducing vocal cord vibrations, making your voice more hoarse.; Drinking alcohol: Drinking too much alcohol can also cause hoarseness; Cold, sore throat, cough, sinus infection: When you have the flu, cough, sore throat or sinus infection, hoarseness will occur but may go away after you recover.; Laryngitis: Allergies, colds or upper respiratory tract infections can cause the vocal cords to become congested, swollen and cause hoarseness.; Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD): When too much stomach acid goes up into the throat, it causes laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Laryngeal reflux will damage the larynx and make your voice hoarse.; Cysts and polyps: If there are benign polyps and cysts on the vocal cords, they will make your voice hoarse.; Vocal cord paralysis: Vocal cord paralysis can lead to hoarseness. Causes: vocal cord paralysis can be due to trauma, thyroid and mediastinal cancer, infection, multiple sclerosis, stroke, Parkinson's disease.; Laryngeal cancer: Hoarseness that lasts more than 3 weeks without improvement after drug treatment can be one of the symptoms of laryngeal cancer.; Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP/laryngeal papillomatosis): This disease causes non-cancerous tumors in the airways that cause hoarseness, the tumors are benign but easily recur.; Dyspnea and voice disorders due to muscle tension: Excessive muscle tension in and around the larynx will prevent the vocal cords from opening and closing effectively.\n\nHow is hoarseness diagnosed?\nThe doctor will examine the nasopharynx and larynx to see if there is any damage in this area causing hoarseness. In addition, if abnormalities are detected, the doctor may order tests.\nSome tests to diagnose hoarseness often include routine laryngoscopy and stroboscopic laryngoscopy.(2)\nStroboscopic laryngoscopy: is an examination of the larynx using a flashing light from a fiber optic light source to record slow-moving video images of vocal cord activity, combined with a rigid or flexible laryngoscope. . This method allows checking the vibration of the vocal cords and the opening and closing activity of the vocal cords, clearly showing vocal cord lesions suspected of tumors or benign vocal cord lesions.\nPhoto: Patients should see a doctor if hoarseness lasts for more than 2 weeks without improvement.\n\nHow to cure hoarseness\nDepending on the cause of hoarseness, the doctor will prescribe appropriate hoarseness treatment methods. Specifically, if:\nHoarse voice due to shouting too much\nYou will need to reduce activities that require you to talk loudly and talk a lot. After a few days, your voice may return to normal.\nHoarseness due to sore throat, flu, cough, fever, gastric reflux, allergies...\nYou will be given flu medicine, cough medicine, sore throat medicine, anti-gastric reflux medicine, allergy medicine... Once your health is stable, your hoarseness will go away.\nHoarseness due to damage to the vocal cords\nYou may need vocal cord surgery to regain your voice. This surgery is performed by an ENT specialist, specializing in voiceology, at the hospital.\nHoarseness due to laryngeal cancer\nYou need to be treated for laryngeal cancer with surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or targeted methods... depending on the stage of your cancer.\n\nHow to prevent hoarseness\nFor common hoarseness conditions, you should:\nKeep your throat warm to avoid colds and sore throats; Avoid drinking wine/beer because high alcohol content can damage the throat and cause hoarseness.; Avoid smoking to prevent the risk of laryngeal cancer causing hoarseness.; Do not speak loudly or shout excessively as this can damage the vocal cords.; You should have regular health checks and screen for laryngeal cancer, thyroid cancer, and nasopharyngeal cancer.\nProlonged hoarseness warns of cancer\nDoctors warn that hoarseness can be a sign of laryngeal cancer, especially if after two weeks of treatment the condition does not disappear.\nAccording to Dr. Hang, laryngeal cancer that forms on the vocal cords often causes hoarseness or voice changes in the early stages, before additional symptoms such as difficulty swallowing or breathing appear. But for cancers that do not start on the vocal cords, hoarseness only occurs after these cancers have progressed to a later stage or have spread to the vocal cords.\nThus, laryngeal cancer progresses silently and has unclear manifestations, so regular cancer screening is very important in protecting health. In particular, if symptoms of hoarseness appear after 2-3 weeks of treatment but do not go away, you should immediately go to the hospital for examination to early detect potentially dangerous health conditions, especially vocal cancer. management – ​​Doctor Hang recommended.\n\nQuestions about hoarseness\nDuring the examination of the ear-nose-throat specialist, we encountered a number of customers' questions about hoarseness.
