    "content": "Vaginal (private area) dryness: Causes, symptoms and diagnosis\n\nVaginal dryness is a common problem in women at some point in their lives, affecting the quality of life and sex life of couples. How to improve vaginal dryness so as not to affect marital happiness? Let's listen to the sharing of MSc. Nguyen Thi Quy Khoa, Doctor of Obstetrics and Gynecology Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City in the article below.\n\nWhat role does vaginal discharge play?\nVaginal discharge, also known as vaginal discharge, is a white mucus produced by glands located inside the vagina and cervix. This fluid plays many important roles in the woman's reproductive system. It is like a \"broom\" that sweeps away dead cells and bacteria, keeping the vagina clean and preventing infection. .\nVaginal secretions also act as a lubricant, moisturizer and stabilize the pH of the genital canal, helping to protect the vagina from the development of pathogens. In addition, vaginal fluid also creates favorable conditions for sperm to easily move into the uterus, facilitating conception.\n\nWhat is vaginal dryness?\nVaginal dryness or vaginal dryness is a condition in which the vagina loses its normal moisture because the tissues in the vagina are dry, thin and have reduced secretions, causing women to feel uncomfortable and painful, especially difficult. in sexual activity.\nVaginal dryness makes women feel itchy, uncomfortable and painful during sex\n\nIs vaginal dryness common?\nVaginal dryness occurs at all ages, most commonly in postpartum women – AFAB (Assigned Female At Birth – a term for a person of any age or gender who is considered a girl after birth) or during menopause when estrogen levels decrease. (first)\nDoctor Nguyen Thi Quy Khoa said that the hormone Estrogen helps glandular cells develop, thickening the vaginal mucosa and secreting fluid to moisten the vagina. When Estrogen production is reduced, the vulvar vaginal mucosa becomes thinner and drier, less elastic and more vulnerable. This condition is quite common when women enter menopause, called vaginal atrophy.\nStatistics show that about 17% of women in the AFAB group aged 18-50 years old said they experienced vaginal dryness during sex, even before menopause. More than half of cases have vaginal dryness after menopause.\n\nCauses of dryness in women\nDoctor Quy Khoa shared that most cases of vaginal dryness occur due to decreased Estrogen levels, which naturally occurs as women get older, when women enter menopause. Menopause is considered when the menstrual cycle has ended and a woman is no longer able to get pregnant.\n\"When Estrogen levels decrease, the skin and tissues of the vulva and vagina become thinner and less elastic, which can cause the vagina to become dry,\" Dr. Quy Khoa added.\nDecreased estrogen levels are the main cause of vaginal dryness\nIn addition, some health conditions or medical treatments can also cause vaginal dryness, including: (2)\nAfter giving birth and breastfeeding your baby.; Side effects of birth control pills or any hormonal contraceptive method.; Improper hygiene of private areas, frequent vaginal douching; The period of foreplay and stimulation before sex is not long enough for enough vaginal fluid to be secreted to lubricate the vagina.; Have diabetes.; Suffering from Sjogren's syndrome - an autoimmune disorder that can cause dryness throughout the body.; Using anti-Estrogen drugs in the treatment of diseases such as uterine fibroids and endometriosis; Use antidepressants or antihistamines in treatments such as treating itchy eyes and runny nose.; Are receiving cancer treatment such as chemotherapy or hormone therapy.; Had oophorectomy.\nReference: Instructions for properly cleaning private areas\n\nSigns of vaginal dryness in women\nThe most common symptoms of vaginal dryness are:\nVaginal itching and infection: a dry vagina will prevent the resident benign bacteria from living, thereby causing disease-causing bacteria to easily penetrate the private area, causing an uncomfortable itchy feeling, causing Inflammatory conditions with symptoms of green or yellow vaginal discharge that may have a foul odor; In addition, due to the use of inappropriate feminine hygiene solutions or improper hygiene habits, washing too many times a day, douching deep in the vagina creates favorable conditions for harmful bacteria to penetrate and develops, leading to frequent and recurring infections; Vaginal burning and pain during sex: when the vagina is dry, it loses its normal moisture, leading to dryness, heat and burning pain in the vagina. When having sex, the period of foreplay and stimulation before sex is not long enough for enough vaginal fluid to be secreted, causing the vagina to not be lubricated enough, which can cause tissue damage in the vagina leading to bleeding. , hurt.\nVaginal dryness can make women afraid and avoid sexual intercourse because of pain or bleeding\n\nThe effects of vaginal dryness on health and life\nDryness in women can cause itching, pain, and dryness in the private area, especially during sex. Can even cause: (3)\nBleeding after sexual intercourse due to abrasion of the tissues in the vaginal wall; Pain in the vulva.; Recurrent urinary tract infections, more frequent urination; Susceptible to fungal infections; Reduced desire or fear of sex; Reduced moisture in the vagina leads to dryness in the vulvar area, which can make women feel uncomfortable when wearing underwear or during daily activities such as walking or sitting.\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nDoctor Quy Khoa reminded that vaginal dryness is rarely a sign of a serious illness, so women do not need to worry too much. However, you should immediately go to a medical facility to be examined by a doctor and given solutions if:\nVaginal dryness seriously affects daily activities; Negative impact on sex life and couple relationship; The condition does not improve with over-the-counter treatments; Symptoms of repeated or severe vaginal bleeding appear.\nWomen need to see a doctor immediately when symptoms of vaginal dryness appear to avoid affecting marital happiness\n\nHow is vaginal dryness diagnosed?\nTo find the cause of vaginal dryness, during the initial examination, the doctor will examine the symptoms and ask about medical history, medications or treatments that the woman is using.\nThe doctor may also suggest that women participate in some tests to increase diagnostic results, such as: (4)\nPelvic examination evaluates vaginal dryness by observing whether the tissue inside the vagina is thin, dry and red; Blood tests determine hormone levels or other health conditions that cause vaginal dryness.; Testing a sample of vaginal discharge rules out other causes, as well as checking for signs of infection.\n\nCan vaginal dryness be cured?\nAnswering the question of whether vaginal dryness can be cured, Dr. Quy Khoa said that women should talk and discuss with the treating doctor to be guided on the most appropriate and effective treatment method.\nCurrently, there are many lubricants that have non-hormonal ingredients, and are applied to the vagina to create local moisture that will help reduce dryness and discomfort. These lubricants can also bring the pH level of the vagina to normal, reducing the risk of urinary tract infections... Women should consult a doctor for advice on choosing a suitable lubricant for the vagina. Be careful not to choose lubricants that contain perfumes, herbal extracts or artificial colors because they can cause irritation to the private area.\nIn some cases, doctors may prescribe women to use Estrogen therapy in the form of pills, creams or rings to release Estrogen. Birth control pills are indicated in cases where women have other menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes.\nTam Anh General Hospital System Obstetrics and Gynecology Center brings together a team of highly qualified and experienced Obstetrics and Gynecology experts, possessing a modern machinery system, closely linked with other specialties in the hospital. Hospitals such as the Testing Center, Imaging Center, Endocrinology Department... provide individualized treatment regimens for each specific case... thereby thoroughly treating the root cause of vaginal dryness in women. Women, there are effective solutions to help women live happily, healthily and happily.\nMSc. Nguyen Thi Quy Khoa, Doctor of Obstetrics and Gynecology Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, has many years of experience and is ready to advise and accompany women in solving the problem of vaginal dryness.\nTo schedule an appointment with Obstetrics and Gynecology specialists at Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\n\nHow to prevent vaginal dryness?\nIn fact, women can prevent and control vaginal moisture well by:\nDrink a lot of water.; Clean private areas regularly and properly.; Do not use products that cause vaginal irritation; Do not use vaginal lubricants or moisturizers without a doctor's prescription to avoid adverse effects.; Have sex with enough quality foreplay to increase vaginal secretions, making lovemaking smoother and easier to reach orgasm.; Do not use condoms containing nonoyxnol-9 or N-9 because these are chemicals that can cause vaginal dryness.; See your doctor immediately when you have symptoms of vaginal dryness to get instructions from your doctor on how to intervene promptly and effectively.; Fully follow your doctor's instructions, do not arbitrarily use medication or stop prescription medications.; Follow up on schedule to have your health status monitored by a doctor.\nHopefully the above information has helped women better understand vaginal dryness so that they can go see a doctor and receive specific treatment instructions from the doctor.
