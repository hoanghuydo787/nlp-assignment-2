    "content": "Dry joints: Causes, treatment and prevention\n\nDry joints cause many inconveniences in the patient's daily activities, especially in the morning. Early examination and treatment will help patients quickly get rid of this condition and prevent dangerous complications.\n\nWhat is dry joints?\nArthritis is a condition in which the joints do not produce or do not produce enough lubricant when the articular cartilage functions. This leads to symptoms such as dry and stiff joints, a cracking sound when moving the joint... Joints that are often dry are the hip joint, shoulder joint, arm joint, especially the knee joint. (first)\n\nSome common dry joint locations\n1. Dry knee joints\nDry knee joint is a condition in which the knee joint makes a clicking or cracking sound every time you move, limiting the ability to move the joint, accompanied by pain, swelling, redness... Because the lubricating fluid in the joint is not secreted or not secreted enough. for lubrication. This condition can appear on one or both sides of the joint.\n2. Dry shoulder joints\nThe shoulder joint is a large joint in the body and has a high frequency of movement. Therefore, this joint is very susceptible to dryness. Patients with dryness in the shoulder joint will experience a cracking or clicking sound in the joint when moving, moving their hands or when massaging the shoulder.\n3. Dry hand joints\nHand joint dryness is a condition in which the articular cartilage of the hands has decreased lubrication. The cartilage layer gradually erodes, causing the hand bones to lose their protective membrane. The disease is often divided into 3 types including dry joints of the elbow, wrist and fingers.\n4. Dry hip joints\nThis is a condition where there is a decrease in lubricating fluid in the hip joint. This condition causes the hip joint to become stiff and difficult to open. The disease can appear in both the elderly and young people due to the influence of work characteristics, hip injuries, and living habits...\n\nReason\nCommon causes of dry joints include: (2)\nAge and osteoarthritis: The natural aging process can cause the joint capsule to not produce enough synovial fluid, thereby causing dry synovial fluid.; Nutritional imbalance: Imbalanced nutrition, vitamin and mineral deficiencies can reduce joint fluid production. This puts bones and joints at high risk of damage. Patients are very susceptible to bone and joint diseases, including dry joint fluid; Living habits: Abusing stimulants such as alcohol, smoking, a sedentary lifestyle or overusing joints, often moving in the wrong position... can also be one of the common causes. cause this condition.; Overweight and obesity: The more your body weight increases, the more pressure your joints will have to endure. This condition can destabilize the joint, making the joint vulnerable and increasing the risk of bone and joint diseases.\n\nSigns and symptoms of dry joints\nWhen it first begins, dry joint disease is often difficult to detect. Because the symptoms are often unclear. However, if paying attention, patients can still notice some unusual signs such as:\n1. Joint pain\nAt the onset, the patient will have mild, transient pain in the affected joint every time they perform contractions, stretches, rotate the joint, or change posture suddenly. Over time, joint pain appears with more frequency. The level of joint pain is now more intense, every time you exercise heavily, walk, run, jump...\n2. Joint stiffness\nIn addition to pain, patients also experience joint stiffness. Especially in the morning, this symptom will be more serious, making it very difficult to stretch the joint.\n3. Joints make sounds\nWhen performing body movements, the joints that become dry are usually the knee and shoulder joints. These joints will make clicking, crunching or cracking sounds. This is the most recognizable symptom of dry joints that needs attention.\n4. Limit movement\nWhen joints are severely dry, the patient's activities are often greatly limited. Joint flexibility is then also reduced.\nIn addition to the above symptoms of dry joints, some cases also have symptoms related to arthritis such as swelling, heat, and redness in the skin around the joints.\n\nIs dry joints dangerous?\nWhen suffering from dry joints, patients often feel pain, discomfort when moving, impaired health and unpleasant mood. In addition, if the disease is not treated early and properly, it can lead to many serious complications, negatively affecting the patient's health such as: (3)\nLimited joint range of motion; Pain and discomfort last a long time, causing negative effects on physical and mental health.; There is a high risk of joint deformity and muscle atrophy. In the case of dry knee fluid, the patient's legs can become crooked and they can walk with a limp.; The most severe complication of arthrosis is joint stiffness. Patients have a very high risk of losing mobility.\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nArthritis does not affect the patient's life. However, without early intervention, patients suffer many dangerous complications. Therefore, when symptoms last more than 1 week, you should quickly go to a reputable specialized medical facility to be examined and accurately determine the cause of dry joints, thereby providing early treatment and prevention. prevent complications.\n\nDiagnosis of dry joints\nClinical examination: The doctor examines the external manifestations of the joint, then asks the patient to perform a few movements to check the mobility and range of extension of the joint. The patient needs to provide information about issues related to medical history, affected joints, pain, etc. From there, the doctor will assess the severity of the disease. (4)\nBlood test: Purpose to diagnose the cause of dry joints and rule out other inflammatory joint diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, infectious arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout...). This method helps check the presence of bacteria in the joint, blood sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein... to determine and assess the condition of arthritis.; Imaging diagnosis: X-rays, CT scans or MRI scans may be indicated to check for bone spurs, subchondral bone damage, evaluate the extent of soft tissue damage, cartilage wear and other abnormalities. Otherwise, joint fluid secretion does not occur.\n\nMethods of treating dry joints\nDepending on the severity and specific cause, the doctor will create a treatment regimen suitable for each patient. Commonly applied dry joint treatment methods include:\n1. Use medicine\nIn the case of dry joints with pain and arthritis, the doctor may prescribe the patient to use some pain relievers, reduce inflammation, and increase lubricant secretion to improve dryness in the joints. When using these medications, patients need to strictly follow the doctor's instructions, avoid arbitrarily increasing/decreasing the dose, changing the medication, and extending the duration of medication.\nWhen abusing anti-inflammatory drugs for a long time, patients may experience side effects including stomach pain, fluid retention causing edema, blood sugar disorders, and affecting liver and kidney function. Drug abuse and improper treatment can lead to joint stiffness, joint adhesion, and even more serious disability. Dependence on anti-inflammatory drugs can potentially lead to an increased risk of osteoporosis, hypertension, diabetes and other metabolic diseases.\n2. Inject lubricant into the joint\nDoctors often inject Hyaluronic Acid lubricant into joints to improve joint dryness, reduce friction on bone ends, thereby helping joints smooth and reduce pain. However, this type of lubricant is only effective for a short time. The patient is forced to repeat the procedure many times.\nIn addition, joint injections need to be prescribed and performed by an experienced bone and joint specialist. Because just a small mistake when doing it can easily cause joint infection, even joint adhesion and muscle atrophy.\n3. Physical therapy\nPhysical therapy exercises are designed specifically for each patient under the guidance of a doctor or physical therapist. Exercise helps increase strength and flexibility for musculoskeletal joints. When improving the mobility of bones and joints, the fluid regulation in the joints will be more regular, thereby effectively reducing joint dryness from the inside.\n4. Surgery\nThe most serious case of dry joints is complete joint damage, with almost no articular cartilage covering the bone surface. At that time, medical treatments were no longer effective. To restore the normal functioning of joint cartilage, your doctor may consider appointing an artificial joint replacement.\n\nHow to prevent dry joints\nTo prevent dry joints, note:\nRegularly exercise and practice exercises with appropriate intensity.; Avoid sitting in one place for too long: Office workers need to regularly stretch, walk, stretch their knees... every 30 minutes to prevent the risk of dry joints.; Limit strenuous exercise: Need to arrange a balance between work and rest time. In addition, you should not carry too much heavy objects to avoid putting too much pressure on your joints, which can easily lead to injury.; Maintain a reasonable body weight: You should eat scientifically and exercise to lose weight when necessary.; Regularly massage to relax and stimulate increased mucus secretion in the joints.; Treat existing injuries and diseases; Supplementing glucosamine: This is also a very effective way to prevent joint diseases. However, supplementation requires a doctor's prescription to ensure safety.; Adopt a healthy diet: You should regularly supplement vitamin C, vitamin D, omega-3, antioxidants and calcium. They help prevent and treat inflammation and joint pain very well, while also preventing degeneration and stimulating effective lubrication of joint fluid.\n\nSome frequently asked questions\n1. Should you walk or exercise with dry knees?\nWhen the knee joint is dry, the patient often has pain when moving and has a clicking sound in the affected joint. What makes patients afraid of movement will put pressure on the knee joint, causing the disease to become more serious. However, light exercise and exercise with appropriate intensity can provide good support for circulatory activities and blood circulation.\nGood blood circulation in the knee joint will support the regeneration of joint cartilage and increase natural fluid secretion. Furthermore, proper exercise also helps increase the flexibility of bones and joints, prevents erosion and degeneration of articular cartilage, and effectively helps improve dry knee joints.\nProper exercise helps increase the flexibility of bones and joints, preventing the erosion and degeneration of joint cartilage\n2. Does osteoarthritis affect height?\nThere is currently no specific research information on how dry joints affect height. However, if this condition persists, it can cause serious bone and joint damage. The disease can cause joint deformities, causing crooked legs and a limp gait.\n3. Can okra cure dry joints?\nThere is a lot of information surrounding the issue of eating okra, foods high in mucus that can help increase lubrication in the joints, thereby allowing the joints to function smoothly and treating dry joints very well. However, this is just a rumor. Currently, there have not been any scientific studies confirming the correlation between okra and osteoarthritis.\nOkra is a healthy food because it contains two nutrients: vitamin K and folate. However, eating okra cannot help increase lubrication in the joints and treat dry joints as well as people think. Because the slime from okra will not go directly into the joints. They will be converted into small components by the digestive system and delivered to parts of the body.\nCenter for Orthopedic Trauma, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is where a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons gather such as: TTND.Prof.Dr.Nguyen Viet Tien; Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa; Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh; MSc.BS.CKII Tran Anh Vu; BS.CKI Tran Xuan Anh, MSc.CKI Le Dinh Khoa, MSc.BS Nguyen Quang Ton Quyen; Dr. Do Tien Dung; Dr. BS.CKII Vu Huu Dung... This is also one of the pioneer units in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal diseases with modern techniques according to updated international protocols.\nThe hospital is also equipped with modern machinery and imaging equipment such as: Somatom Drive 768-slice CT scanner, new generation Magnetom Amira BioMatrix magnetic resonance machine, Artis Pheno robot, densitometer. bones, ultrasound machines...; Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss surgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table... to be able to detect injuries early and effectively treat musculoskeletal diseases...\nTam Anh General Hospital also owns a spacious clinic system and high-class boarding area; modern rehabilitation area; Comprehensive post-operative care process helps patients quickly recover and stabilize their health after surgery.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Orthopedics Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nArthritis does not pose a danger to the patient's life.
