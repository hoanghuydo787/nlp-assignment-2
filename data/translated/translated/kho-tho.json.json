    "content": "Difficulty breathing, shortness of breath: Causes, symptoms and treatments\n\nHave you ever felt like you couldn't get enough air? If so, you have encountered a condition medically known as a phenomenon\nshortness of breath. It can be a sign of heart or lung diseases that require early diagnosis and intervention.\n\nDon't ignore difficulty breathing - a warning sign of many serious heart and lung diseases\n\nWhat is shortness of breath?\nShortness of breath, sometimes described as “air hunger” or shortness of breath (Shortness of Breath)  is a fairly common respiratory problem. On average, 1 out of every 4 people who come to see a respiratory doctor has difficulty breathing. This symptom causes the patient to always be in a state of lack of oxygen, fatigue, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, and interrupted breathing.\nAccording to Professor Ngo Quy Chau, shortness of breath and inability to breathe normally can range from mild to severe, from temporary to long lasting. Diagnosis and treatment need to correctly determine the cause of this phenomenon.\n\nSymptoms of difficulty breathing are common\nA healthy adult has a normal inhalation and exhalation rate of 20 times/minute (about 30,000 times/day). In case of vigorous exercise or a cold, your breathing rate will be faster or slower but you will not feel short of breath. (first)\nBe wary if you find yourself constantly experiencing the following symptoms:\nFeeling stuffy or suffocated;; Rapidly breath;; Chest tightness;; Rapid, shallow breathing;; Heart beating fast;; Wheeze;; Cough.\n\nCauses of difficulty breathing\nIn some cases, difficulty breathing is considered a normal phenomenon. That's when you exercise too hard, climb mountains/stairs too much, or work hard for long periods of time without resting. This condition will go away on its own after you stop the above physical activities. However, if the condition occurs with continuous frequency and is not caused by strenuous exercise, you are likely suffering from a medical condition.\nIf symptoms appear suddenly, it is called acute dyspnea. The cause is usually:\nExcessive anxiety and stress; Pneumonia; Choking or inhaling foreign objects blocking the respiratory tract; Allergy; Anemia; Exposure to high concentrations of carbon monoxide; Hypotension (low blood pressure); Pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the artery to the lungs); Lung rupture; Hiatus hernia; End-stage incurable disease\nIf a person experiences difficulty breathing compared to normal for more than a month, the condition will be classified as chronic. Causes may be due to:\nAsthma; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); Cardiovascular problems; Overweight – obesity; Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis – a disease that causes scarring of lung tissue\nIn addition, some other lung and heart diseases can also lead to shortness of breath. These diseases include:\nCroup (acute croup); Lung injury; Lung cancer; Pulmonary tuberculosis; Pleurisy (inflammation of the tissues surrounding the lungs); Pulmonary edema (occurs when too much fluid builds up in the lungs); Pulmonary hypertension; Sarcoidosis (clusters of inflammatory cells develop in the lungs); Cardiomyopathy (myocarditis, myocardial dilatation...); Heart arrhythmia; Heart failure; Coronary artery disease; Pericarditis (condition in which the tissues surrounding the heart become inflamed).; Covid-19; Shortness of breath and difficulty breathing after Covid\n\nSubjects prone to difficulty breathing\nBesides people with heart and lung diseases, the following people are at risk of getting the disease:\n1. Pregnant women\nMild shortness of breath is a very common symptom during pregnancy (2). There are many reasons leading to this phenomenon: pregnant women breathe faster due to an increase in the hormone progesterone (a hormone only secreted during pregnancy), the heart has to work harder, causing the mother to feel short of breath, tired, and hyperemic. Lungs decrease towards the end of pregnancy…\nPregnant women in the last months of pregnancy should rest a lot\n2. People with chronic diseases\nDyspnea can occur when the patient is experiencing the development of certain diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, liver and kidney diseases...\n3. Newborns\nUpper respiratory tract diseases causing acute dyspnea are a relatively common pediatric emergency. In addition, airway malformations, foreign body aspiration and epiglottitis are also common causes of difficulty breathing in newborns.\nNote: Babies' breathing rates are often faster than adults'. Normally, newborns breathe 30 - 60 times/minute, and slow down to 20 times/minute when sleeping. A 6-month-old baby's normal breathing rate will decrease to 25 - 40 times/minute. (3)\n\nDiagnostic method\nProf. Dr. Ngo Quy Chau said that doctors can make a diagnosis based on a comprehensive physical examination of the patient, along with a full description of the symptoms they experience. You need to let your doctor know how often your shortness of breath occurs, how long it lasts, and how severe it is.\nIn addition to the examination, the doctor will prescribe you to perform some of the following paraclinical tests to find the cause of the disease:\nChest X-ray and CT scan: to more specifically diagnose the condition, and evaluate the health of the heart, lungs and related systems.; Electrocardiogram (ECG): to identify any signs of a heart attack or other heart problems.; Spiral measurement test: to measure the patient's airflow and lung capacity, thereby identifying breathing problems.; Blood test: helps examine the level of oxygen in the blood as well as the blood's ability to transport oxygen.\nBlood tests are an important step in the patient examination and diagnosis process\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nSometimes, difficulty breathing can be a warning sign of a dangerous medical condition. Therefore, you need to see a doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms:\nThe condition occurs over a long period of time with no clear cause;; Dyspnea has a sudden onset but is very severe;; Loss of ability to function due to difficulty breathing;; Chest pain;; Nausea;; Difficulty or inability to breathe when lying down;; Swelling of feet and ankles;; Fever, chills and cough;; Wheeze.\n\nSymptoms\nShortness of breath is a result of hypoxia or hypoxemia, i.e. low oxygen levels in the blood. Therefore, if you are subjective to this condition without any treatment, the brain will not be provided with enough oxygen to function for a long time, leading to temporary or permanent cognitive impairment. Along with that comes a series of other dangerous complications such as brain damage, brain necrosis, stroke...\n\nTreatments\nFor complete treatment, you need to adjust your lifestyle, before proceeding with medical interventions. Specifically:\n1. Have a reasonable diet and exercise regimen\nIf overweight - obesity and lack of exercise are the causes of your shortness of breath, aim for a healthier diet and exercise regularly to bring your weight back to normal limits. In case you are suffering from a chronic disease, you should consult your doctor for advice on appropriate nutrition and exercise.\n2. Pulmonary rehabilitation\nIf you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other lung problems, you need care from a pulmonologist. You may have to breathe oxygen to improve; or conduct the \"Pulmonary Rehabilitation\" treatment. This is a \"lung exercise\" program, through which experts will guide you on breathing techniques to help your lungs work more effectively.\n3. Cardiac rehabilitation\nIf the cause of shortness of breath is related to the heart, it means your heart is too weak to pump enough oxygen-carrying blood to the body's organs. Cardiac rehabilitation can then help you manage heart failure and other cardiovascular conditions. In severe cases of heart failure, your doctor will prescribe an artificial pump to take over the task of pumping blood from the weakened heart.\n\nHow to prevent difficulty breathing?\nTo prevent shortness of breath, you need to adjust your lifestyle and practice beneficial habits such as:\nDon't smoke: If you don't smoke, don't ever touch it. If you have smoked for many years, quit smoking immediately. It's never too late, your lung and heart health will start to improve within hours of your last cigarette.; Environmental pollution and toxic chemicals in the air can also lead to respiratory problems. Therefore, you should get into the habit of wearing a mask every time you go out. Additionally, if you work in an environment with poor air quality, use a mask to filter out lung irritants, and make sure your workplace is always clean and well-ventilated.; Maintaining a reasonable weight will help you avoid some respiratory health problems\nMaintain a reasonable weight with scientific nutrition and exercise to prevent heart and lung diseases\nThe Department of Respiratory Medicine at Tam Anh General Hospital also coordinates closely with clinical departments (Respiratory, Surgery, Intensive Care, Cardiology, Endocrinology, Musculoskeletal, Emergency...) and paraclinical departments such as Laboratory departments (biochemistry, hematology, microbiology), Diagnostic Imaging Department, Cytopathology Center... create a closed process, helping to accurately diagnose medical conditions to develop treatment regimens. Reasonable treatment, shortening recovery time for patients.\nFor advice and to schedule an examination for respiratory diseases at the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Tam Anh General Hospital, you can contact:\nDifficulty breathing and shortness of breath can be signs of many diseases related to the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Therefore, if you are experiencing unusual and prolonged shortness of breath, you should immediately go to the hospital for examination. Having a scientific lifestyle and reasonable diet will help minimize this phenomenon and the risk of other dangerous diseases.",
