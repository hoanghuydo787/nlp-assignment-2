    "content": "No sperm: Causes, diagnosis and treatment\n\nStatistical results show that about 10-15% of cases\nno sperm\n among men with infertility. However, andrology experts believe that, if examined early and treated promptly and properly, men will not completely lose the opportunity to become fathers.\n\nWhat is azoospermia?\nAbsence of sperm (another name is azoospermia - Azoospermia) is a medical term used to describe the condition of not seeing sperm after centrifugation and viewing under a microscope with 400 times magnification.\nExperts often divide this condition into two types: obstructive azoospermia and non-obstructive azoospermia. Among them, the proportion of men with azoospermia not due to obstruction accounts for the majority, up to 40% of cases.\n\nCauses of azoospermia\nAccording to Andrology experts, Tam Anh General Hospital, the cause of azoospermia is directly related to two conditions due to obstruction or non-obstruction.\nThe cause is not due to blockage\nNo sperm due to diseases in the hypothalamus - pituitary gland: The hypothalamus - pituitary gland plays a very important role in controlling biological rhythms, body temperature, especially releasing and inhibiting hormones. pituitary hormones. If the hypothalamus - pituitary gland is damaged, it will lead to disorders in the release of hormones such as GnRH and gonadotrophin, causing azoospermia.; No sperm due to genetic problems including abnormalities in chromosome number (Klinefelter Syndrome, Down Syndrome, Noonan Syndrome...) or chromosome structure (such as Kallmann Syndrome, chromosome deletion Y, Y chromosome has 2 centromeres...)\nAzoospermia due to testicular causes includes no testicles (Anorchia), undescended testicles (testicles have not descended into the scrotum), Sertoli Syndrome (testicles cannot produce viable sperm), spermatogenesis agenesis ( testicles cannot produce fully mature sperm), testicular atrophy after mumps...\nCause of blockage\nThe second group of causes is the appearance of blockages in many locations such as the vas deferens, epididymis, and ejaculatory ducts, causing sperm to become blocked.\n\nSymptoms of azoospermia\nPatients may not have any symptoms or even know they have azoospermia until their attempts to conceive are unsuccessful. Other signs are often related to hormonal imbalance or genetic chromosomal abnormalities.\nIf not, you can rely on the following symptoms:\nLess sexual desire; Erectile dysfunction; Lumps, swelling or discomfort around the testicles; Little or no beard or hair\n\nDiagnosis of azoospermia\nDiagnosis of azoospermia is difficult to detect through external symptoms. Therefore, to diagnose the disease, doctors will mainly rely on semen testing methods.\nThe man's semen sample will be examined by centrifuge or under a microscope. In cases where semen volume is low, doctors must search for more sperm in the urine after ejaculation. The absence of sperm and immature germ cells in the semen suggests complete blockage of the vas deferens.\nIn addition, doctors will prescribe a number of additional tests:\nTest sex hormones, especially testosterone; Chromosomal testing; Computed tomography (CT scan) or ultrasound to check the shape and abnormalities (if any) of the reproductive organs.\n\nTreatments for azoospermia\nTreatment for azoospermia depends on the cause of the disease. Accordingly, Andrology experts can implement the following methods.\nInternally medical treatment\nPatients with azoospermia due to hypopituitarism (ie non-obstructive causes) can be treated with hormonal drugs. Hormonal medications include follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), clomiphene, anastrazole, and letrozole.\nSurgical treatment when indicated\nSurgical intervention will be applied to solve some patient problems that cause azoospermia due to reasons such as:\nVaricocele; Azoospermia due to blockage in the testicles; Azoospermia due to blockage in the epididymis; Blocked vas deferens; Widening of the seminal vesicle or seminal vesicle neck\nAssisted reproductive techniques\nTo serve reproductive support measures such as sperm injection and in vitro fertilization, doctors conduct the following reproductive support methods:\nPercutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration (PESA); Microepididymal sperm retrieval surgery  (MESA); Testicular sperm retrieval surgery (TESE); Microsurgery to remove sperm from testicles (Micro-TESE)\nIf the cause of azoospermia is due to genetic factors and can be transmitted to children, the doctor may recommend that the patient analyze the genetic factors of sperm before implementing supportive measures. fertilization aid.\n\nThings to do to support the treatment of azoospermia\nTo treat azoospermia effectively, Andrology experts recommend that patients should:\nComply with the instructions for taking the medicine at the correct time and dosage; Follow-up appointments as scheduled for close monitoring; Pay attention to your body's symptoms and notify your doctor when necessary; Build a healthy lifestyle, balanced nutrition, and appropriate exercise\nDepartment of Andrology, Tam Anh General Hospital System with a team of experts and doctors who are skilled, dedicated, enthusiastic, and confident in mastering the most advanced techniques with the support of machinery and equipment systems. Modern diagnostic imaging equipment such as: Somatom Drive 768-slice CT scanner, new generation magnetic resonance machine Magnetom Amira BioMatrix, ultrasound machine; Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss surgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table; Spacious facilities... will help detect early and have effective and quick treatment plans for azoospermia.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment for azoospermia with leading experts at the Department of Andrology, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:",
