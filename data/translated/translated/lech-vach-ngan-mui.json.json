    "content": "Deviated nasal septum: Causes, signs and treatments\n\nYour nasal cavity is seriously displaced, you feel difficulty breathing or poor breathing, you may be suffering from a deviated nasal septum. This is a structural disorder of the nose, due to the impact of the septum dividing the two nostrils, making it curved and misaligned, causing your nostrils to deform, with one nostril narrower than the opposite side. This article is expertly advised by Doctor Tran Thi Thuy Hang - Head of Ear, Nose and Throat Department - Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nWhat is a deviated nasal septum?\nA deviated nasal septum is a condition in which your nasal septum is moved significantly to one side, making the air passage on one side of the nose smaller than the other. Deviation occurs when the nasal septum dividing the wings of your nose is moved, causing your nose to become crooked and abnormally deformed. The normal rate of nasal septal stenosis does not affect health. However, if the misalignment is severe, it can cause health complications such as difficulty breathing or blocked nostrils.\n\nWhere is the nasal septum located?\nThe nasal septum is a part of the nasal structure located in the nasal cavity, dividing the two nasal cavities. The nasal septum is composed of cartilage and bone, about 8cm long starting from the tip of the nose to the nasopharynx.\n\nHow many types of nasal septum deviation are there?\nDeviated nasal septum has other names such as deviated nasal septum, narrowed nasal septum, nasal septal crest. To classify nasal septum deviation, doctors usually base on the degree of deviation as follows:\nDeviated septum on one side of the nose (C-shaped deviation): Often the nose is blocked on the side of the deviated septum.\nDeviation of nasal septum on one side\nDeviated septum on both sides of the nose (S-shaped): The deviated nasal septum is complex, it can be crooked to the left or to the right. If both sides of the nasal septum are crooked, the nose will be stuffy on both sides. .; Nasal septum spikes or crests: Commonly found at the junction of the bone and cartilage of the septum. Nasal septum spikes or crests can touch the nasal mucosa, causing bleeding and severe pain for the patient.; Septal thickening: This is a condition where the bone is thickened in the lower part of the septum.\n\nSigns of deviated nasal septum are common\nAbout 80% of people have a deviated nasal septum but don't know it. However, when you see the following signs, it proves that you have a deviated nasal septum. (first)\nStuffy nose\nYou find it difficult to breathe through your nose, your nose is blocked on one side or both sides. This condition of nasal congestion often occurs, but is mild so it is often easy to ignore. The congestion lasts a long time, even though your nose is not infected.\nHeadache\nThe headache can be on the right or left side, depending on which side the nose is crooked, or there can be pain in the eye socket on the same side as the crooked septum. In some cases, the pain can be on both sides and then spread to the posterior occipital area.\nFrequent rhinitis and sinusitis\nDeviated nasal septum causes blockage in the nostrils\nFrequent nosebleeds; Sleep; Reduced olfactory sensitivity; Sleep in one direction; Dryness on one side of the nose; Postnasal drip; Nose noise when inhaling or exhaling; Noisy breathing sounds during sleep in infants and young children; In severe cases, sleep apnea may occur\n\nCauses of deviated nasal septum\nNatural\nSome cases of deviated septum occur during the mother's pregnancy, the fetus develops and manifest clearly when the baby is born.\nNose damage\nSome injuries can cause the nasal septum to move out of its original position. In infants, this injury often occurs during childbirth. In children and adults, a variety of accidents can lead to nasal trauma and deviated septum. Being hit in the nose can cause a fracture of the main nasal bone with deformity of the nasal septum. Factors that increase the risk of nasal septum deviation include: Sports injuries, not wearing a seat belt when driving motor vehicles such as cars.\nDue to aging\nNormal aging of the human body can also change the structure of the nose and cause the nasal septum to curve to one side over time.\nDue to infection\nChronic inflammation of the nose, allergic rhinitis, and sinusitis make patients uncomfortable. Frequent nose wiping due to rhinitis at a young age, when the septum is not fully developed, can change the structure of the septum, leading to a crooked nasal septum.\nDue to failed rhinoplasty surgery\nMany failed beauty surgeries such as rhinoplasty and nose wing narrowing also push the nose to one side.\n\nMethod for diagnosing nasal septum deviation\nTo accurately diagnose the degree of nasal septum deviation, the doctor will perform a clinical examination and take medical history and symptoms.\nIn addition, in cases of severe deviation and many complications, the following imaging diagnosis will be indicated:\nUse specialized ear-nose-throat endoscopy tools to directly monitor the entire nasal septum, thereby diagnosing deviated nasal septum disease.; X-ray of the face: When X-ray of the face is taken, the image results will reflect the deviation of the bony septum.; Sinus CT scan: A CT scan with clear images helps doctors observe details inside the nasal cavity, including the narrowest and deepest part of the nose, and investigate complications of sinusitis due to deviation. caused by the septum.\nA CT scan of the face can check for nasal deviation.\n\nComplications due to deviated nasal septum\nDeviated nasal septum normally does not affect health, however, there are still a large number of people with deviated septum that go untreated, leading to serious complications. The cause is deformed nostrils, narrowing of the airway on one or both sides, affecting the respiratory system, thereby causing many consequences. (2)\nSusceptible to respiratory diseases: People with a deviated nasal septum cause the nose to be crooked to one side, the airway on one side of the nostril is narrowed or blocked, making the patient susceptible to respiratory diseases.; Sore throat: Prolonged and severe nasal congestion will cause the patient to breathe through their mouth, causing dry mouth; Sinusitis; Nosebleed; Sleep; Sleep apnea syndrome\n\nTreatment methods for deviated nasal septum\nMild deviated nasal septum does not require treatment. However, if there are symptoms such as nasal congestion, nosebleeds, or sinusitis, the patient needs to go to the hospital for timely examination and treatment by a doctor. Currently, there is no medication to straighten the septum. In most cases, deviated septum affects the function of the nose and sinuses, causes snoring, and frequent bleeding of the nasal vessels, requiring surgical intervention.\nDrug treatment\nDrug treatment mainly reduces symptoms of nasal congestion due to mucosal edema, rhinosinusitis, and allergic rhinitis.; Vasoconstrictor nasal drops: The drug's effect reduces nasal tissue swelling, helping the airways on both sides of the nose stay clear.; Nasal sprays containing corticosteroids: Nasal sprays can reduce swelling in the airways, limiting nasal discharge.; Antihistamines: Medications that help prevent allergy symptoms, including nasal congestion and runny nose.\nSurgical intervention\nSeptum correction surgery is a method often used by doctors when medical treatment with medication fails.\nThe patient is anesthetized, then the surgeon will separate the mucosa covering both sides of the nasal septum, then remove the deviated septum and restore the mucosa to its original position. When excess bone cartilage is removed, the septum and nasal passages will be straightened.\nWhen the surgery is over, the doctor places a soft sponge on one side of the nasal cavity to fix the septum. The patient will be taken to the recovery room until the patient regains consciousness. When the patient is awake, he or she can breathe through one nostril. The next morning, the soft sponge will be removed and breathe through both nostrils. Normally, patients are discharged from the hospital after 1 day and re-examined after 1 week. After septum surgery, patients may have mild nasal congestion, usually lasting 2 to 3 days. Avoid air-conditioning fans rotating directly on the face, gently spray nasal drops, and limit blowing the nose strongly.\nPatients should avoid running and jumping activities for 1 week after surgery. Patients can return to work or school within 2 to 3 days after surgery if they feel ready. (3)\n\nHow to prevent deviated nasal septum\nDeviated nasal septum can be prevented if the following measures are followed:\nLimit nose injuries: You should wear a helmet or mask when playing sports such as football, volleyball, and baseball. In addition, you need to wear a seat belt when riding a car.; Limit trauma during childbirth: Deviated nasal septum can occur due to trauma during childbirth. During natural birth, there may be collision of the fetus's nose and face with the mother's pelvis, causing narrowing of the nasal septum. In addition, during the abortion process, using an improper intervention device such as a forcep to perform a vaginal abortion can also damage the baby's nose.\nTo find out the cause and effectively treat nasal septum deviation, you can go to Tam Anh General Hospital System at the contact address: - Hanoi 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Bo De Ward, District 1. .Long Bien, City.
