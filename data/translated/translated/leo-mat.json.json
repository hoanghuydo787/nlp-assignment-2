    "content": "Stye: Causes, signs, diagnosis and prevention\n\nPeople with styes often experience redness, swelling, pain, and a feeling of grit in the eye, obstructing vision and making daily activities inconvenient. So what is a stye? Are styes contagious? How to treat styes?\n\nWhat is a stye?\nA stye is an acute swelling of the eyelid margin, which can be on the outside or inside of the eyelid. Styees are caused by infection with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, leading to redness, swelling, pain... Internal styes look like lumps or pustules at the edge of the eyelid [1]. Observing with the naked eye, a stye can easily be confused with a chalazion. This condition usually lasts 1-2 weeks and can go away on its own. Eye styes are often divided into 3 types:\nMultiple styes: multiple styes on one eyelid, both eyelids, or both eyes; Stye in the eyelid: grows inside the eyelid, usually due to infection from the meibomian gland. Meibomian glands are found in the upper and lower eyelids of the eyes. The gland has the function of secreting a layer of fat to moisten and lubricate the eye surface.; External stye: a stye that grows outside the eyelid margin due to infection of the gland of Zeis.\n\nCauses of stye\nStyes are often caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria (staphylococcus aureus bacteria) that infect eyelash follicles. Styes on the outer eyelids are often caused by blockage of sebaceous glands (Zeis) or sweat glands (Moll). The blockage occurs in the lash line and is red, swollen, painful, and develops into pustules. Styes on the inner eyelid are caused by blockage of the meibomian glands and pustules form on the inner surface of the eyelid. Styes can appear on the upper and lower eyelids.\nThe risk of eyelid margin infection causing styes is higher if the following factors are present:\nWearing contact lenses: While wearing and removing glasses, if your hands are not clean, you can easily transmit bacteria from your hands, causing eyelid infections and styes.; Poor hygiene: poor hygiene is a common cause of styes. The habit of rubbing your eyes can easily cause bacteria to come into contact with your eyes. Not washing your face or cleaning your eyes creates opportunities for bacteria that cause styes; Old or dirty eye makeup: Eye makeup tools left unsanitized for a long time can collect dust and bacteria. Makeup is a catalyst for dust and bacteria to come into contact with the eyes, causing swelling and infection, forming a stye.; Blepharitis, inflammation or infection of the eyelids: acute or chronic blepharitis. Blepharitis can cause swelling and pus under the eyelids; Rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis or diabetes.\nThe patient has a stye on the lower eyelid.\n\nSigns of stye\nA stye begins with a small, pale yellow pustule that develops at the base of the eyelash with surrounding congestion, induration, and edema [2]. After 1-2 days, the eyes may become watery and a bit scratchy. The inflammation can be severe sometimes with fever or chills. Checking the conjunctiva will see a small yellow area protruding above the stye. Sometimes a stye can rupture  or dissolve on its own. Fluid from a burst stye needs to be cleaned.\n\nMethod of diagnosing styes\nA stye that has just begun to develop is often difficult to recognize with the naked eye because there are no signs of inflammation [3]. If you suspect you have a stye, you should see an Ophthalmologist for timely examination and treatment. The doctor will prescribe the following diagnoses:\nMedical history: to determine symptoms and health problems contributing to the stye; Examine the outside of the eye: including eyelid structure, skin texture, shape and eyelashes; Evaluate the eyelid border: eyelashes, oil gland holes using a specialized eye examination machine.\n\nHow to treat styes?\nIn many cases, styes will disappear on their own without treatment. The following methods can be applied to treat styes at home [4]:\nApply warm compresses: with a clean cloth on the eyelids for 5-10 minutes. Do this 3-5 times a day, every day until the stye swelling reduces. Warm compresses have the role of softening tissue and facilitating the passage of oil glands; Gently exfoliates eyes.; Keep your hands clean, wash them after touching many objects and after going to the toilet.; Wash your face every day, wash the eye area.; Do not touch your eyes or stye areas with your hands; Do not squeeze pimples or try to squeeze styes. This will irritate or deform the cornea.; Do not wear makeup until the stye heals.\nIf home treatment does not help, the patient needs to see an Ophthalmologist for examination and appropriate treatment. Depending on the condition of the stye, the doctor may prescribe treatment with the following methods:\nUsing an anti-bacterial eye cream or ointment can help shorten its duration and severity. Some commonly used antibiotic ointments such as macrolides and erythromycin eye drops have the added benefit of lubrication. If the stye is swollen and puts pressure on the cornea, topical steroids can be used for a short time.; Systemic antibiotics are indicated when the infection spreads and progresses to periorbital cellulitis.; If oral antibiotics are not effective, minor surgery will be needed to make an incision and drain the fluid.; In some cases, a biopsy may be performed if cancer is suspected\nStaphylococcus aureus bacteria are the main cause of styes.\n\nHow to prevent eye styes?\nStyes cause pain, discomfort, affect vision, and make communication difficult. Below are methods to prevent styes [5]:\nKeep eyelids and eyelashes clean, remove eye makeup before sleeping.; Wash your hands before touching the area around your eyes.; Do not share eye makeup.; Change eye makeup every 3 months.; Keep contact lenses clean, do not wear contact lenses too much.; If you have blepharitis, you need to be examined and treated according to your doctor's instructions.; Do not share towels or household items with someone who has a stye.\n\nFrequently asked questions about styes\n1. Is a stye the same as a chalazion?\nStye and chalazion are two different diseases that are often difficult to distinguish [6]. Chalazions form around the sebaceous glands and between the eyelids. Chalazion is caused by the breakdown of secretions in leaking or blocked oil glands, causing swelling but little pain. Chalazion often develops into a painless granuloma that is considered a chronic, sterile inflammatory condition. While styes form due to bacterial infection in oil glands or eyelid margins.\n2. Can a stye go away on its own?\nA stye can heal on its own if you know how to take care of your eyes properly [7]. Keep your eyes clean and your eyelids clear. Do not touch the stye in the eye. You should shield your eyes from dust and dirt with protective glasses. In addition, warm compresses also help styes disappear faster when self-treating at home.\n3. Are styes contagious?\nStyes are not contagious, so there is no need to be afraid when contacting and communicating with someone who has a stye.\n\nWhat is the nutritional regimen when the eye has a stye?\nWhen the eye has a stye - the patient should supplement foods containing vitamins that are good for the eyes and increase resistance such as: vitamin A found in foods, carrots, spinach, spinach, spinach, pumpkin, sweet potatoes, bell peppers, liver, fish oil... Vitamin C is found in oranges, tangerines, strawberries, papaya... Vitamin E is found in tomatoes, pumpkin seeds, almonds, avocados...  Some foods help cool the body, Reduce inflammation such as: pears, watermelon, green beans, bitter melon, lotus seeds, chia seeds...\nPatients should avoid eating hot foods, which increase heat and easily cause inflammation. Patients with styes should limit some foods such as mango, longan, guava, spicy foods, onions, goat meat, seafood, etc. They should limit alcoholic beverages, gas, and lots of sugar, which weaken the body's immune system. body and body heat. Foods high in salt and processed are also not good for your health when treating a stye.\n\nHow to take care of an eye with a stye\nWhen you have a stye, the first thing to do is calm down. Do not rub your eyes, do not arbitrarily apply anything on your eyes that will make the stye condition worse [8]. Patients can self-care for styes at home in the following ways:\nGently wash your eyes, clean the eyelids to help clear them; Use a clean towel dipped in warm water, wring it dry and apply it to your eyes for 5-10 minutes.; Minimize touching your eyes with your hands. If you need to touch your eyes, wash your hands thoroughly.; Do not try to squeeze the stye as it will make the condition more serious, affecting vision and even damaging the eye.; Do not wear makeup until the stye heals.; Wash your face before bed to remove all dirt.\nThe Eye Department at Tam Anh General Hospital System is equipped with modern machinery and equipment and a team of highly qualified doctors and nurses to help protect your eyes.\nEye styes do not seriously affect health, however, in some cases, not taking good care of the eyes will cause complications that greatly affect vision. If you notice that your stye is swollen and painful, you should see an ophthalmologist for timely examination and treatment.",
