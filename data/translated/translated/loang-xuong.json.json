    "content": "Osteoporosis: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis, classification\n\nOsteoporosis is one of the common diseases with increasing age. If this disease is not detected early and treated promptly, it can lead to many extremely dangerous complications. The disease often progresses silently, without obvious symptoms. In some cases, the disease is only discovered when complications occur. Therefore, each individual should regularly have regular health check-ups and proactively equip themselves with knowledge about the disease to protect their health.\n\nWhat is osteoporosis?\nOsteoporosis (osteoporosis, brittle bones) is a condition in which bones continuously thin. Bone density gradually decreases over time, making bones more brittle, easily damaged and broken even with minor trauma. Osteoporotic fractures can occur in any bone. Among them, the most common are fractures of the spine, femur and forearm. Some bones, when broken, will not be able to heal, such as the spine and femur. These cases often require expensive surgical treatment. (first)\nThe disease often progresses silently. Patients may feel unclear pain, height loss, and hunchback and curvature of the spine. These are symptoms that are only discovered after a long period of time. In some cases, the disease is only discovered when there are signs of bone fracture.\nThe older you get, the more severe osteoporosis will become. As we get older, bone metabolism changes, causing disorders in bone formation and bone destruction, leading to reduced bone density.\n\nSigns of osteoporosis\nBone loss (reduced bone density) due to osteoporosis often has no obvious signs. Patients often do not know they have the disease until their bones become weak and break easily after minor trauma such as a twisted leg, fall, or impact. Common symptoms of the disease are: (2)\nReduced bone density: This condition causes the bones of the spine to collapse and fracture. Patients often suffer from acute back pain, loss of height, stooped gait, and hunchback; Bone pain: This is the most easily noticed symptom of reduced bone density. The disease will cause fatigue along the long bones, even pain all over the body like needles.; Pain in the weight-bearing bones of the body, these bones include: spine, lumbar, pelvis, hip, and knee. The pain recurs many times after injury. Patients often have long-lasting dull pain. The pain gradually increases when exercising, moving, standing or sitting for a long time; remission with rest.; Pain in the spine, waist or both sides of the ribs: This condition affects the intercostal nerves, femoral nerves and sciatic nerves. Back pain becomes worse when the patient exercises vigorously or suddenly changes position. Therefore, patients will have many difficulties when performing positions such as bending and turning completely.; Reduced bone density in middle-aged people can be accompanied by signs of varicose veins, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis...\n\nCauses of osteoporosis\nAge is the leading cause of reduced bone density. In addition, some of the following effects can also cause disease such as: (3)\nWomen entering menopause or having irregular menstrual cycles causing decreased estrogen levels are often at high risk of the disease. In men, low testosterone levels are also a cause of osteoporosis.; Unscientific diet, lacking nutrients, especially substances beneficial for bones and joints such as calcium, vitamin D, omega-3...; Side effects of drugs due to long-term use of corticosteroids and heparin, not following doctor's instructions; A sedentary lifestyle, not exercising, low activity levels, sitting a lot... can all lead to weakened bones and joints.; Stimulants such as alcohol, beer, and cigarettes are harmful agents that promote and weaken the bone and joint system; People who do heavy lifting and have to regularly lift heavy objects are at a higher risk of developing musculoskeletal diseases than normal people.; Not providing enough necessary calcium during the period of formation and development of the bone and joint system is also the cause of premature bone and joint weakness.; In addition, there are many risk factors that can lead to osteoporosis. Some factors can be changed, others cannot.\nRisks that cannot be changed include:\nGender: In women, especially postmenopausal women, the risk of osteoporosis is higher than in men of the same age. Because women have lower total bone mass and postmenopausal hormone changes.; Age: The older you are, the higher your risk of getting the disease; Body size: Thin, small women are often at higher risk of osteoporosis; Family history of someone having had the disease before; Women who reach menopause before age 45.; Have ever had a broken bone.; Suffering from other diseases: Endocrine diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease, Cushing's syndrome...; Caucasian or Asian race.\nModifiable risk factors include:\nSex hormones: Low estrogen levels can cause decreased bone density in women. Meanwhile, low testosterone levels can cause osteoporosis in men.; Dietary deficiencies in nutrients such as calcium and vitamin D.; Anorexia nervosa: An eating disorder that can lead to osteoporosis.; Long-term use of drugs such as corticosteroids and heparin; Activity level: People who are lazy to exercise or sit for long periods of time can cause weak bones.; Smoking: Smokers often have lower bone density than non-smokers. Therefore, smokers are more susceptible to the disease.; Drinking alcohol: Alcohol abuse can weaken bones, causing them to break easily.\n\nClassification of osteoporosis\nOsteoporosis is classified based on the cause of the disease. Based on bone density measurement results, doctors divide the disease into many different levels. Each classification will show the progression and severity of each patient.\nAccording to the cause of the disease, osteoporosis is divided into 2 types:\nPrimary osteoporosis\nIn this case, the development of the disease is directly related to age or menopause in middle-aged women. The disease mechanism begins with aging from osteoblasts.\nThis condition causes an imbalance between the number of newly regenerated bone cells and destroyed bone tissue, leading to reduced bone density. Primary osteoporosis includes:\nPostmenopausal (osteoporosis type 1)\nThe cause of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women is a decrease in the hormone estrogen. In addition, decreased parathyroid hormone production and increased urinary calcium excretion also contribute to bone density becoming thinner.\nType 1 osteoporosis mainly affects women between the ages of 50 and 55 and postmenopausal. Typical symptoms include:\nMineral loss of spongy bone; Fracture; Subsidence of vertebrae\nOld age (osteoporosis type 2)\nAs you get older, the risk of osteoporosis increases. Because of the calcium metabolism function, the nutrients needed for bones were gradually weakened, causing an imbalance in bone formation and bone destruction. The disease affects both men and women, especially people aged 70 and over. Type 2 osteoporosis has the following characteristics:\nGlobal demineralization: This condition occurs in both spongy and compact bones; Older people with osteoporosis are more likely to have complications than younger people, the most common being femoral neck fractures.\nSecondary osteoporosis\nSecondary osteoporosis often has a clearly identifiable cause. The onset of this osteoporosis condition is mainly related to chronic diseases in the body or incorrect medication use habits. Common causes of secondary osteoporosis include:\nHyperthyroidism; Diabetes; Acromegaly; Chronic liver disease; Have a history of gastric bypass; Hemochromatosis and other genetic diseases; The body is deficient in nutrients; Using diuretics for a long time or overusing drugs such as corticosteroids or heparin; Suffering from spinal diseases; Rheumatoid arthritis; Suffering from multiple myeloma (Kahler) and other cancers\n\nDetermine bone density\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has established standards for determining osteoporosis through bone density measurement (BMD) results. First, your BMD results will be compared with the BMD results of a healthy 25 - 35 year old person of the same gender and ethnicity as you. Standard deviation (SD) is the difference between your BMD and a healthy 25 - 35 year old person, called the T score.\nT-score within 1 SD (+1 or -1): Normal bone density.; T-score about 1 – 2.5 SD below average (-1 to 2.5 SD): Osteopenia; T-score about 2.5 SD or more below the average (more than -2.5 SD): Osteoporosis\nIn addition to the T-score, your BMD is also compared to the BMD of a healthy person of the same age (Z-score). The Z-score shows whether your bone density is lower or higher than that of healthy people of the same age, gender, height, weight and race. The Z score is evaluated as follows:\nZ score above -2.0: Normal; Z score = +0.5, -0.5 or -1.5: Popular with premenopausal women; Z score ≤ -2.0: Bone density is lower than the age group standard\n\nDiagnostic method\nOsteoporosis Measurement\nBone Mineral Density (BMD) is a technique that uses dual-energy X-rays (DXA or DEXA) or CT scans to determine calcium and mineral content in bones. Common areas where bone density measurements are performed are the spine, hips or forearm bones. The purpose of this diagnostic method is to detect problems with osteoporosis (thin, weak bones) and bone loss (reduced bone mass).\nCurrently, Tam Anh General Hospital system is a reliable address for you to feel secure in performing osteoporosis measurements. All machine systems at the hospital are new generation and advanced. Therefore, patients will receive results very quickly and with high accuracy. In addition, the hospital also has a team of experienced doctors with high expertise in the field of image diagnosis, who will provide accurate diagnoses through the results obtained.\nProdigi bone mineral density measuring machine (GE/Mexico) at Tam Anh General Hospital System\nThe osteoporosis machine system at Tam Anh General Hospital system not only has the function of measuring bone density to diagnose osteoporosis, but also integrates many important functions such as assessing the risk of bone fractures and calcification. ... The outstanding advantages of the machine compared to previous generations are the high-frequency dual-energy X-ray source, the OnePass one-time scanning feature that helps eliminate image distortion errors, and high resolution, thereby exporting images. High quality, clear.\nBlood and urine tests\nIn addition to measuring osteoporosis, your doctor may also recommend blood and urine tests. These tests will help check hormone levels and look for risks that increase bone loss such as vitamin or mineral deficiencies in the body.\n\nIs osteoporosis dangerous?\nWhen patients do not receive timely treatment or are treated improperly, complications of osteoporosis may appear such as: (4)\nFractures: Osteoporosis reduces bone density, making bones weak, brittle, and prone to breaking. In some cases, just a slight collision, bending over, coughing or sneezing can cause bone fractures. Because the spine, femur, forearm, arm, and leg bones are the bones that bear the most impact in the body. Therefore, when osteoporosis occurs, these are the bones that are most commonly affected. Femoral neck fractures, forearm fractures, and hip fractures are common conditions in elderly osteoporosis patients.; Vertebrae collapse: Vertebrae collapse due to osteoporosis can lead to permanent disability. In addition, this complication can cause nerve roots to be compressed, causing lasting pain. A large number of damaged vertebrae can cause spinal degeneration to progress faster.; Impaired mobility: People with osteoporosis may be permanently disabled. This condition reduces quality of life, especially in older adults. Patients often have to lie motionless in one place for long periods of time. This can lead to other complications such as pneumonia, necrosis, limb embolism...\n\nHow to treat osteoporosis\nTreat osteoporosis using a combination of non-pharmacological and medicinal methods\nMethod without using drugs\nDiet: Patients should supplement calcium-rich foods according to their body's needs and avoid drinking alcohol and smoking. In addition, you should also control your weight well, avoid being overweight or underweight; Lifestyle: You should exercise regularly to increase muscle flexibility. In addition, patients need to be careful in daily activities to prevent falls; Orthopedic devices and braces can be used to reduce pressure on the spine, bone ends, and hip bones.\nMethod of taking medicine\nWhen treating osteoporosis, patients need to supplement the body with enough calcium of about 1,000 - 1,200 mg/day and the necessary amount of vitamin D of about 800 - 1000 IU/day. In addition, doctors may prescribe patients to use additional anti-bone destruction medications such as:\nAlendronate: Fosamax plus or Fosamax 5600 (1 tablet/week).; Zoledronic acid is administered intravenously at a dosage of 5mg/100ml per year. The drug is contraindicated in patients with severe kidney failure and heart rhythm disorders; Calcitonin is often prescribed for patients with bone fractures or pain due to osteoporosis, dosage is 50 - 100 IU/day, needs to be used in combination with bisphosphonate group.; The selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), Raloxifene (Evista) is often prescribed for women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, at a dosage of 60 mg/day.; Other groups of drugs commonly used in the treatment of osteoporosis include:; Strontium ranelate (Protelos): Drug that enhances bone formation and inhibits bone destruction; Deca-Durabolin and Durabolin: Drugs that help increase anabolism.\nSee more: 4 popular drugs to treat osteoporosis today\nTreatment of complications\nComplications from osteoporosis can cause pain or bone fractures depending on the severity of the disease. To treat complications, many different methods are needed.\nPain treatment: Treatment is based on the pain relief ladder of the World Health Organization (WHO) combined with Calcitonin.; Fracture treatment: The doctor will apply treatment methods such as wearing a brace, injecting cement into the vertebral body, and replacing artificial vertebrae. In some cases, doctors may consider bone replacement or joint replacement surgery if indicated.\nLong-term treatment\nIn addition to the above methods, to improve treatment effectiveness, patients will need to undergo long-term treatment such as:\nMonitor and comply well with your doctor's instructions throughout the treatment process.; Re-check bone density periodically to evaluate treatment results.; People with osteoporosis should receive long-term treatment for about 3 - 5 years. After that, the doctor will need to re-evaluate the condition to recommend further treatment.\n\nHow to prevent osteoporosis\nTo slow down and prevent osteoporosis, in addition to identifying secondary causes of osteoporosis, you need to note:\nSupplement your body with enough calcium and vitamin D through your diet, consult your doctor for advice on appropriate supplements.; People in the risk group should have osteoporosis measured to check and early detect signs of osteoporosis.; Regularly exercise with appropriate intensity to build strong bones and increase muscle flexibility, especially for older people.; Do not smoke, abuse alcohol and stimulants to avoid harm to bones and joints.; When musculoskeletal problems appear (bone and joint pain, muscle pain, frequent cramps...), you should go to the hospital for timely examination and treatment.; Avoid overusing pain relievers and anti-osteoarthritis drugs, especially corticosteroids. Misuse of these drugs can worsen osteoporosis, leading to dangerous complications.; Be cautious when living and working to avoid unfortunate accidents.\n\nHow to care for sick people\nNutrition\nPeople with osteoporosis should have a healthy diet to control, prevent disease progression, and best support disease treatment.; Nutrition principles for people with osteoporosis need to ensure adequate amounts of vitamins, minerals, and calcium; Prioritize choosing fresh, clean food ingredients; When taking care of elderly patients, family members should grind food into small pieces and divide it into several meals a day. In addition, older people often have difficulty absorbing nutrients because their digestive system has aged. Therefore, family members can discuss with doctors about supplementing supplements and functional foods for patients.\nReference: What should you eat and avoid if you have osteoporosis?\nMove your body\nPeople with osteoporosis when exercising should pay attention to warming up before exercising and relaxing the body after exercising. Before exercising, you need to warm up for about 10 - 15 minutes with simple movements such as standing up, sitting down, jogging on the spot. After exercising, the patient should relax the body for about 5 - 10 minutes by relaxing the whole body and taking deep breaths. In addition, elderly patients should avoid exercises that have a strong impact on the bones, especially exercises that change positions suddenly.\nPrevent falls\nFalling is an extremely dangerous situation for people with osteoporosis. Therefore, in daily activities, patients need to pay attention to:\nAvoid going out alone, do not move on slippery, rocky, gravelly, bumpy ground; Make sure all areas of the house always have enough light.; The floor should be dry, clean, and tidy. Carpets or wooden floors can be used to avoid slipping and limit the risk of falling for patients.; Install additional handrails on stairs or bathrooms. Family members should stay next to the sick person to help move up and down stairs or when necessary.; Patients should wear shoes with anti-slip soles; Elderly patients should be careful when using drugs that cause dizziness or vertigo because they can affect movement and easily cause falls.; Regularly re-examine periodically\nOsteoporosis treatment can last about 3 - 5 years. Patients should maintain the habit of regular check-ups, use medication according to doctor's instructions, and re-measure bone density every 1-2 years. This will help assess disease progression and response to treatment. Through the examination results, the doctor will evaluate the overall condition of the disease and the level of osteoporosis, thereby recommending further treatment.\nCenter for Orthopedic Trauma, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is where a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons gather such as: TTND.Prof.Dr.Nguyen Viet Tien; Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa; Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh; MSc.

The Z score is evaluated as follows:\nZ score above -2.0: Normal; Z score = +0.5, -0.5 or -1.5: Popular with premenopausal women; Z score ≤ -2.0: Bone density is lower than the age group standard"
