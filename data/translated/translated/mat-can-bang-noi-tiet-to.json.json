    "content": "Hormonal imbalance: Causes, symptoms and diagnosis\n\nScientists determine that the human body has more than 50 hormones. The endocrine system produces hormones to control most important functions throughout the body, regulating metabolism, growth and development, mood, sexual function, reproduction... So what if What happens to the body when there is a hormonal imbalance? What are the causes, symptoms and diagnosis?\n\nWhat are hormones?\nHormones are substances that coordinate many different functions in the body by transmitting messages through the blood to organs, skin, muscles, and tissues. Hormones play an important role in health with about 50 types of hormones in the human body.\nDifferent endocrine glands make up the endocrine system. Hormones help control various functions in the body, including: metabolism, homeostasis, growth, development, sexual function, mood, reproduction, sleep cycles. (first)\n\nWhat is hormonal imbalance?\nHormonal imbalance is when the body has too much or too little of one or more hormones. With many types of hormones, if the body has too much or too little hormone level, it can cause major changes that affect health.\nIn some cases, patients with hormonal imbalance are only temporary, but there will be patients with chronic hormonal imbalance. In addition, some cases of hormonal imbalance require treatment to maintain physical stability and not affect health. Some common hormonal changes include:\nIrregular menstruation (menstruation): there are hormones related to the menstrual cycle; So if this imbalance occurs in the body, it will cause irregular menstruation. Hormonal disorders cause irregular menstrual cycles with symptoms such as: polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), amenorrhea.; Infertility: Hormonal imbalance is the cause of infertility in women. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the ovaries do not have mature ovarian follicles, causing anovulation, which can cause infertility.; Acne: caused by clogged pores. Hormonal changes, especially during puberty when oil glands are stimulated and hormones are highly active, causing many acne to form.; Hormonal acne (adult acne): occurs due to hormonal changes causing the skin to increase oil secretion. This condition often occurs during pregnancy, menopause or in people undergoing testosterone treatment.; Diabetes: when the pancreas does not produce or the body does not have enough insulin hormone or does not use insulin properly, it affects health.; Thyroid disease: hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone levels), hyperthyroidism (high thyroid hormone levels).; Obesity: some imbalanced hormones will signal the body's need for food or how the body uses energy, easily leading to weight gain in the form of fat storage. In case of excess cortisol hormone, low thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) also causes obesity.\nHormonal imbalance causes irregular menstruation, easily forming acne.\n\nCauses of hormonal imbalance in women\nWomen often experience hormonal imbalance at certain times such as: menstrual cycle, puberty, pregnancy, and menopause. In addition, living habits and environmental conditions also cause female hormone imbalance. Endocrine glands include cells located throughout the body that create, store, and release hormones into the blood. Different endocrine glands regulate different organs in the body. There are many causes of hormonal imbalance in women such as: (2)\nUnhealthy diet.; Too much stress causes stress; The body accumulates a lot of fat.; The pituitary gland has a tumor.; Diabetes.; Prader-Willi syndrome (rare disorder after birth, frequent feeling of hunger, this sign begins around 2 years of age).; Hereditary pancreatitis; Endocrine gland damage; Severe infection.; Toxins, pollutants, herbicides, pesticides.; Serious allergic reactions; Abuse of anabolic steroid drugs (increases protein in cells, stimulates muscle growth).; Only one active X chromosome (Turner syndrome causes heart and ovarian defects).; An overactive or ineffective thyroid gland; Phytoestrogen, estrogen from foods such as soybeans (too much estrogen can easily cause breast cancer, ovarian cancer, infertility, autoimmune disorders).; High glucagon levels (leading to diabetes-like symptoms).; High insulin levels in the body; Too much or too little parathyroid hormone to balance the amount of calcium in the blood).; Birth control pill.; Hormone replacement drugs.; Tumors or cysts are benign but also affect the endocrine glands.; Cancer.; Chemotherapy or radiotherapy.; Solitary thyroid nodules (non-fatal, including signs of nasopharyngeal cancer).; High levels of the hormone cortisol; Too little cortisol and aldosterone hormones (Addison's disease has many symptoms of female hormone imbalance such as: fatigue, sexual dysfunction).; Iodine deficiency.; Anorexia.; Medicine.; Ovarian cancer, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), premature menopause, hormone replacement drugs, birth control pills, premature ovarian insufficiency (POI – occurs when a woman's ovaries stop functioning normally before age 40, causing the body does not produce normal amounts of estrogen hormone or release eggs regularly, easily leading to infertility).\n\nIs endocrine imbalance dangerous?\nHave. Hormonal imbalance, if left untreated, will endanger your health and quality of life. Hormones help control and regulate the activities of organs and cells in the body. Common causes of hormonal imbalance are stress, diet, environment, lifestyle, and age. (3)\nHormone deficiency also seriously affects health. Low insulin levels in the body lead to diabetes causing blood sugar imbalance; Low DHEA hormone also causes depression and stress; Cortisol hormone levels increase or decrease due to anxiety and chronic stress. In particular, there are 4 types of hormones that have a greater direct impact on mental and brain health such as:\nEstrogen: hormone that helps regulate mood, growth, development, and the female reproductive system. This hormone also affects the endocrine system, bones, fat, and cardiovascular system. (4); Progesterone: hormone that improves anxiety and stress; Testosterone: hormone that regulates mood, strength, and sexual function (low testosterone levels also cause decreased sexual desire).; Thyroid: organ that regulates energy for the body.\n\nSymptoms of hormonal imbalance\nThe body has more than 50 different hormones with different important functions. Symptoms vary depending on which hormone imbalance is present. Symptoms of hormonal imbalance include:\n1. Affects metabolism\nMetabolism involves chemical reactions in the body's cells that help convert food into energy. Symptoms of hormonal imbalance affecting metabolism include:\nSlow or fast heart rate; Unexplained weight gain or loss; Tired.; Constipation.; Diarrhea or going to the bathroom more often; Numbness, tingling hands; High blood cholesterol level.; Depression, anxiety.; Cannot tolerate hot and cold temperature changes; Dry skin and hair; Thin skin.; Body fat is unevenly distributed; Dark skin in the armpits, groin or back of the neck (acanthosis nigricans).; Thirst, frequent urination.\n2. Signs of hormonal imbalance in women\nWomen are born with an imbalance in the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone produced by the ovaries or an excess of testosterone and male hormones. Sex hormone imbalance leads to symptoms such as:\nAcne appears a lot on the face, chest or back.; Hair loss.; Lots of body hair.; Feel hot inside body.; Irregular menstruation.; Reduced sexual function.; Vaginal atrophy and dryness.\n3. Signs of hormonal imbalance in men\nWhen men are born, an imbalance in testosterone produced by the testicles and other sex hormones will lead to symptoms such as:\nReduction or loss of body hair.; Erectile dysfunction (ED).; Gynecomastia (enlarged breast tissue).; Reduced sexual function.; Loss of muscle mass.\nHormonal imbalance symptoms vary depending on the hormone imbalance of the different endocrine snow.\n\nDiagnosis of endocrine imbalance\nEndocrine disorders lead to various symptoms. Some symptoms of hormonal disorders are easily confused with other medical conditions. Therefore, endocrine disorders are difficult to diagnose, so doctors will ask patients to perform a number of tests such as:\nThe test evaluates the amount of hormones in the urine or blood, to determine whether the hormone level is increased or decreased. Depending on the type of hormone, the time of taking the test is very important to avoid falsifying the results.; Diagnostic imaging tests such as ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging will be prescribed by the doctor when there are hormone abnormalities. In some cases, no visual abnormalities are detected in the endocrine glands, but the amount of hormones secreted is greatly disturbed.\n\nTreatment of endocrine imbalance\nDepending on the cause of the disease, the Endocrinologist - Diabetes specialist will apply different methods to treat hormonal imbalance.\nIf the patient has lower than normal hormone levels, the doctor will prescribe hormone replacement therapy. Depending on which hormone is deficient, the patient needs to take pills or injections.\nFor example, if the patient has low thyroid hormone levels (hypothyroidism), the doctor will prescribe synthetic thyroid hormone medication or if the patient has a growth hormone deficiency, a synthetic growth hormone injection will be required.\nIf a patient has higher than normal hormone levels, many different treatments can be applied depending on the cause of the disease. Treatment methods include: medication, surgery, radiotherapy or a combination of methods to improve the condition.\nIf a prolactinoma (a benign, non-cancerous tumor) causes excess prolactin hormone, your doctor will prescribe medication to shrink the tumor or surgery to remove it.\nBesides, patients also need to change their lifestyle to balance hormones such as: relaxing to control stress levels, exercising regularly to protect better health.\n\nHow to prevent hormonal imbalance\nAlthough hormonal imbalance cannot be prevented, having a healthy lifestyle also helps keep hormones healthy and balanced such as:\nMaintain a reasonable weight.; Have a scientific diet: Eat lots of fiber and healthy fats (coconut oil, fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, sardines...); Regularly exercise to increase resistance; Avoid tension and stress; Get enough sleep.; Regularly see a doctor for examination and control of underlying diseases (if any).; No smoking.; Avoid blue light at night: exposure to blue light from technological devices such as cell phones and computer screens will disrupt sleep. The body responds to blue light like daylight, adjusting hormones in response. Exposure to artificial light in the evening inhibits the hormone melatonin, affecting many functions in the body. Avoiding blue light helps regulate hormones, restoring natural circadian rhythms after better sleep.; Limit eating foods high in sugar; Drink green tea.; Avoid eating too much.\nRegular exercise helps balance hormones and strengthens resistance.\nDepartment of Endocrinology - Diabetes, Tam Anh General Hospital has modern technological equipment with many experienced doctors in examining and treating diabetes and other endocrine disorders. Patients coming here will receive specific advice about their condition to have an appropriate treatment regimen.\nHormonal imbalance can be difficult to identify because many of the symptoms are similar to other diseases. Therefore, when the body has any unusual symptoms, the patient should see an Endocrinologist - Diabetes specialist for examination to help balance hormones and better protect health.",
