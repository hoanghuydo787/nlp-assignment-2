Not everyone has insomnia after giving birth. However, it cannot be denied that this is an extremely common phenomenon in women after giving birth.\nPostpartum insomnia may disappear on its own after the baby is 2 months old. However, there are cases that will last a long time, leading to chronic insomnia, affecting the quality of life later.\n\nWhat is postpartum insomnia? Causes of postpartum insomnia\nAdults need 7 to 8 hours to sleep.
