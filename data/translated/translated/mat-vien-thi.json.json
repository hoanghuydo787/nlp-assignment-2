    "content": "Farsighted eyes: Causes, signs, diagnosis and prevention\n\nAbout 4.6% of children and 30.9% of adults globally have presbyopia [1]. So what are the causes, signs, diagnosis and prevention of presbyopia?\n\nWhat is Farsightedness (Hyperopia)?\nHyperopia is a common eye disease where close-up vision is blurred. Patients with farsightedness will often have an easier time seeing objects that are farther away (at least 6 meters or nearly 20 steps) but have difficulty seeing objects that are close. People with severe farsightedness may have blurred vision when seeing things around them, even at any distance.\nFarsightedness tends to run in families. Doctors can help patients correct the condition by measuring and recommending appropriate eyeglasses, contact lenses or surgery.\n\nHow does farsightedness affect vision?\nTo see clearly, light rays must pass through the front of the eye (cornea and lens). Then, the cornea and lens work together to bring light into the retina (back layer of the eye). The retina sends signals to the brain allowing people to see.\nHowever, for people with farsightedness, light entering the eye will shine behind the retina instead of entering the correct retina. This causes light rays to focus behind the retina, or in other words, distant objects appear clearly while near objects appear blurry.\nMost children are farsighted but their vision is not blurry. With mild farsightedness, most children see clearly both near and far. As you grow older, your eyes will develop and mild farsightedness will decrease or disappear completely.\n\nCauses of farsightedness in the eyes and risk factors\nThere are many factors that lead to farsighted eyes and genetics is only one part. If parents are farsighted, their children are also at risk of developing farsightedness. But if the parents are not farsighted, the child is still likely to be farsighted. Common causes of farsightedness in the eyes include:\nShort eyeballs: patients have relatively short eyeballs (from front to back). Doctors often call this condition “decreased axial length”; Flat cornea: the patient has a flatter cornea than expected.\nThe cornea is the transparent outer layer of the eye that bends light entering the eye and helps it reach the retina - a thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye. A slightly curved cornea bends light entering the eye at the right angle to reach the retina.\nBut if the cornea is too flat or the distance between the front and back eyes is too short, it will be imbalanced. As a result, light enters the eye but does not reach the target of the retina. The light rays are not focused but stay behind the retina, making nearby objects look blurry. Sometimes, other parts of the eye can be adjusted to help see clearly, but with higher levels of farsightedness, the eye needs the help of glasses or other methods to focus.\nEye anatomy\n\nSigns of farsightedness in the eyes\nPeople with presbyopia may not notice any problems with their vision. But if the eye muscles need to work harder for the patient to see, symptoms of farsightedness will appear in the eyes such as:\nBlurred vision, especially near objects; It is more difficult to see at night.; Eye strain (including burning and pain in or around the eyes).; Difficulty reading, squinting when reading; Complications of farsighted eyes; Strabismus; Myopia\n\nCan farsightedness be cured?\nFarsightedness can be corrected through surgery that changes the shape of the cornea or lens to redirect light to the retina. [2]\nEyeglasses and contact lenses also help correct vision without surgery. LASIK provides a permanent solution for presbyopia because vision will only be corrected as long as glasses or contact lenses are worn.\n\nDiagnosis of farsightedness in the eyes\nFarsightedness is diagnosed with a basic eye exam that includes:\nVision test: the doctor asks to read a chart in the room. If the test shows farsightedness, the doctor uses a retinoscope to see the light reflected from the patient's retina. In addition, doctors also use a phoropter – a testing device to help decide the best prescription for glasses or contact lenses.; Refraction test: to determine whether the patient has vision problems such as nearsightedness, farsightedness or astigmatism. The doctor uses different instruments and asks the patient to look through several lenses to test near and far vision. In addition, the doctor will put drops in the eyes, dilating the pupils to check eye health. This makes the patient's eyes more sensitive to light for several hours after the examination, allowing the doctor to see wider angles inside the patient's eyes.; Keratometry: This method supports the diagnosis and treatment regimen for corneal diseases such as refractive errors and keratoconus. This is a useful method for planning appropriate treatments such as eyeglasses, contact lenses, and surgery. In addition, this is also a way to evaluate changes over time in the corneal surface.; Slit lamp: this is a comprehensive eye exam. The patient sits in a chair facing the light slit, with his chin and forehead resting on the support column. The doctor will use this instrument to observe details of the eye and determine if there are any abnormalities. The doctor can discuss the results with the patient immediately.\n\nHow is farsightedness treated?\n1. Eyeglasses\nThe lenses in eyeglasses help correct presbyopia by changing the way light focuses on the retina. This helps improve vision caused by farsightedness. There are a variety of lens types including monofocal, bifocal, trifocal and progressive multifocal. The degree of farsightedness determines the type of lenses the patient needs and how often they should wear them. [3]\n2. Contact lenses\nContact lenses work like eyeglasses. Glasses will correct the bending of light as it enters the eye. But the contact points are smaller than the lenses in glasses and are located right on the surface of the eyeball. The glasses come in a variety of materials and styles including soft and hard, gas permeable, combined with spherical, toric, multifocal and single-angle designs. Contact lenses are safe, comfortable and convenient but can cause dry eyes and eye infections.\n3. Surgery\nThese surgical procedures correct farsightedness by reshaping the curvature of the cornea. Surgical methods include [4]:\nLaser assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK): the doctor creates a thin, hinged flap into the cornea. Then, a laser is used to correct the curves of the cornea to help correct presbyopia. Recovery from LASIK surgery is usually faster and less difficult than other corneal surgeries.; Laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK): the doctor creates an ultrathin flap in just the outer protective layer of the cornea (the epithelium). The doctor then uses a laser to reshape the outer layers of the cornea, changing its curve and then replacing the epithelium.; Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK): This procedure is similar to LASEK, except the surgeon completely removes the epithelium and then uses a laser to reshape the cornea. The epithelium is not replaced but grows back naturally, conforming to the new shape of the cornea.\nThe lenses in eyeglasses help correct farsightedness.\n\nHow to prevent farsightedness in the eyes?\nThere is no way to prevent farsightedness, patients need to have regular eye examinations so that doctors can promptly treat them.\nHowever, some lifestyle habits can help keep eyes healthy such as:\nEat a nutritious diet: nutrients like vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E and lutein help protect vision.; Get regular eye exams: doctors check for eye problems before symptoms appear.; Wear sunglasses, even on cloudy days: choose sunglasses that can block 99% or more of the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation.; Rest your eyes regularly: looking at a screen for long hours can strain your eyes and lead to computer vision syndrome. Make small changes to your routine to help prevent or reduce discomfort.; Control chronic health conditions: some conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure can affect vision if left untreated.; Prevent eye injuries: wear protective eyewear when doing certain activities such as playing sports, mowing the lawn, painting or using products with toxic fumes.; Do not smoke: smoking is not only harmful to your health but also has a negative effect on your eyes.; Use appropriate corrective glasses: lenses optimize vision and regular eye exams ensure the strength of glasses is suitable for the patient's eye condition.; Use good lighting: ensure enough light to see clearly.; Reduce eye strain: look away from computers, books and other eye-focused activities every 20 minutes for 20 seconds at a distance of 6m.\nIt is normal for eyes to gradually age. Patients over 40 years old with farsightedness often need to wear reading glasses sooner. Finally, the patient needs to see a doctor for an examination and choose suitable eyeglasses or contact lenses so the patient can see more clearly. Tam Anh General Hospital with experienced and highly specialized ophthalmologists helps the examination, diagnosis and treatment process be appropriate for patients.\nFarsightedness is the condition of seeing distant objects more clearly than near objects. Through this article, we hope that patients will understand more about farsighted eyes. Patients know the causes, signs, diagnosis and prevention of eye diseases.",
