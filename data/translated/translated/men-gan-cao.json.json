    "content": "High liver enzymes: Levels, complications and prevention\n\nHigh liver enzymes can be a warning sign that the liver is not working normally. When liver cells are damaged or inflamed, they release enzymes into the blood, causing high liver enzymes.\n\nWhat is high liver enzymes?\nFirst of all, we understand that liver enzymes are proteins that the liver produces, which help speed up chemical reactions in the body, including: producing bile and substances that help blood clot, break down food and toxins. , while also fighting infections. (first)\nThe amount of this protein in the blood is an indicator of good liver health. However, high liver enzyme levels do not always indicate liver damage or serious disease.\nElevated liver enzymes are often a warning sign of liver inflammation or damage\nSometimes, factors such as hormonal changes or reactions to medications can temporarily increase liver enzyme levels. Elevated levels caused by these factors will usually return to normal in about 2 to 4 weeks without treatment.\nCommon liver enzymes include:\n–  Alanine transaminase (ALT)\n– Aspartate transaminase (AST)\n– Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)\n– Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)\nElevated liver enzymes are often a warning sign of inflammation or damage to liver cells such as: Hepatitis or liver diseases. Accordingly,  when liver cells are inflamed or damaged, they release liver enzymes into the blood, at higher levels than normal, increasing liver enzymes in blood tests.\nHigh liver enzymes can be detected during routine blood tests. In most cases, liver enzyme levels are only slightly and temporarily increased. Elevated liver enzymes are also not a sign of a serious, chronic liver problem.\n\nLiver enzyme levels are elevated\nAccording to doctors, there are 4 common liver enzyme indexes divided by age and gender. Accordingly, normal indexes are determined as follows:\n– ALT (or GPT) less than or equal to 35 UI/l (for men) and less than or equal to 25 UI/l (for women)\n– AST (or GOT) less than or equal to 35 UI/l (for men) and less than or equal to 25 UI/l (for women)\n– GGT from 5-60 UI/l\n– ALP from 35-115 UI/l\nIncreased liver enzymes more or less do not reflect the severity of liver damage, but increased liver enzymes mean our liver is having problems. Therefore, when someone takes a test and finds high liver enzymes, they should see a doctor and promptly get advice on examination and treatment.\n\nCauses of increased liver enzymes\nThere are many reasons why liver enzyme levels change. Some causes are temporary and will resolve on their own. Some other causes are more serious and require medical treatment. (2)\nCauses of increased liver enzymes include:\n– Certain medications: Certain medications, including acetaminophen, antibiotics, and some cholesterol-lowering drugs, can also increase your liver enzyme levels.\n– Herbal supplements: Supplements such as iron, vitamin A, comfrey and chaparral can increase liver enzyme levels.\n– All types of hepatitis: Any type of hepatitis (including hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C,  D, E, autoimmune hepatitis) causes hepatitis and is the cause of liver disease. elevated liver enzymes.\n– Alcohol: Drinking a lot of alcohol can also increase your liver enzyme levels.\nDrinking too much alcohol can easily cause liver enzymes to increase\n– Fatty liver disease: Heavy alcohol use, obesity and metabolic syndrome and a variety of other factors can cause fatty liver disease. Regardless of the cause, fatty liver disease will increase your liver enzyme levels.\n– Wilson's disease: inherited copper metabolism disorder causing copper deposition in the liver.\n– Hemochromatosis: This is a rare condition that occurs when your body accumulates too much iron. High levels of liver enzymes can be a symptom of this condition.\n– Cirrhosis: Cirrhosis is a condition of chronic liver damage. This damage causes liver enzyme levels to increase.\n– Liver cancer: Cancer affects liver enzyme levels.\nThyroid disease: Hyperthyroidism can sometimes cause high liver enzyme levels.\n\nIncreased liver enzymes may be accompanied by the following symptoms:\n1. Itchy skin\nItching is a symptom of chronic liver disease, which can be caused by elevated liver enzymes, but not everyone with elevated liver enzymes develops this disease. It must be distinguished from itching due to allergic mechanisms, which are very common in people without liver disease. (3)\nYou may have itching in your lower arms or it may be itchy all over your body. If it itches a little and goes away soon, there's no need to worry. However, constant itching can interfere with sleep and lead to a variety of other problems. When itching occurs, it is also a serious health concern.\nItching is one of the symptoms of high liver enzymes.\n2. Digestive disorders\nPeople with high liver enzymes leading to cirrhosis often have some characteristics of digestive dysfunction, causing serious impacts on the patient's nutritional status, quality of life and health.\nCommon symptoms of digestive disorders in people with high liver enzymes may be related to factors and severity of liver disease, leading to a decrease in daily food intake, contributing to the deterioration of nutritional status in the patient. cirrhosis.\n3. Jaundice\nJaundice occurs when there is too much bilirubin (a yellow pigment) in the blood – a condition called hyperbilirubinemia. In patients with hyperbilirubinemia, abnormally high liver enzyme levels must be differentiated from liver damage due to cholestasis. Jaundice can indicate a serious underlying condition so prompt diagnosis is essential. Rapid determination of the cause relies on taking an appropriate history, physical examination, and interpretation of serum and biochemical tests. Liver biochemical results will indicate whether jaundice is related to elevated liver enzymes and intrinsic liver diseases.\n4. Stool is light yellow\nLight yellow stools can be a sign of liver problems, related to elevated liver enzymes. Normal stools vary in brown color, mainly due to your diet. If your stool is pale yellow or clay-colored, we are likely having problems with the biliary system, including: gallbladder, liver and pancreas.\nThe liver releases bile salts into the stool, making the stool brown. In cases where the liver does not produce enough bile, or the flow of bile is obstructed and cannot exit the liver, the stool color may become pale.\nOccasional light yellow stools may not be a cause for concern. But if it happens often, you could have a dangerous liver disease. At this time, you need to see a specialist for advice and treatment.\n\nHow to treat elevated liver enzymes\nTreatment for elevated liver enzymes depends on the cause. In many cases, liver enzyme levels return to normal within about a month. You may need to switch medications, stop taking supplements, or cut back on alcohol, but you won't need a treatment plan.\nIn other cases, your doctor may need to treat a condition that causes elevated liver enzyme levels by ordering more tests, such as imaging tests, to get a better look at the liver, or blood tests. . Or a liver biopsy may be required. Depending on the results the treatment will depend on the final diagnosis.\nIf you're concerned your liver enzyme levels may be elevated, you may want to consider making some lifestyle changes at home, such as:\n– Reduce alcohol intake or completely eliminate alcohol from your diet\n– Be cautious with medications and supplements\n– Stay active, including regular exercise\n– Try to add foods good for the liver to your diet and maintain a moderate weight.\n\nDangerous complications of high liver enzymes\nElevated liver enzymes are a serious warning sign of the patient's health. If not controlled and treated promptly, the patient's life can be in danger. Elevated liver enzymes over a long period of time will cause a number of dangerous complications such as cirrhosis, liver inflammation, and even liver cancer.\nLiver cancer is a dangerous complication of elevated liver enzymes\nSymptoms of increased liver enzymes are often difficult to recognize, especially in cases where liver enzymes only increase 2 times, there will often be no warning signs, so many people take it lightly, thereby putting their health at risk.\nFor people who regularly use alcohol and stimulants, liver cells can be destroyed, causing serious consequences. In the long term, cancer complications can occur, affecting life.\n\nHow to prevent high liver enzymes\n– Do not drink alcohol, or drink in moderation.\n– Absolutely do not share needles or items contaminated with blood.\n– Eat healthy, scientifically, increase the consumption of foods that are good for the liver.\n– Fully vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.\n– If the patient has diabetes, they should manage blood sugar well.\n– Use caution when using any medications or supplements you are taking.\n– Monitor your weight and maintain it at a reasonable level.\n– Exercise daily to improve overall health.\nHigh liver enzymes have many different causes, including liver disease and medications. Increased liver enzymes in some cases may also be temporary. If your blood tests show high levels of liver enzymes, talk to your doctor to find the cause and treatment.",
