    "content": "Metapneumovirus: Causes, targets and prevention\n\nHuman metapneumovirus is a respiratory virus that spreads rapidly in winter and early spring (1). Similar to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), this strain of virus causes upper respiratory tract infections and can cause dangerous complications (pneumonia, bronchitis, etc.) when left undetected and undetected. Treat properly. (2)\n\nWhat is Metapneumovirus?\nHuman Metapneumovirus (Human Metapneumovirus – hMPV) is a strain of the Paramyxovirus family (same family as respiratory syncytial virus) discovered in 2001 by scientists in the Netherlands. This is one of the viruses that causes acute respiratory infections in all ages, including upper respiratory tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections.\nSome scientific studies have shown that about 10-12% of children suffer from respiratory diseases caused by Metapneumovirus. Most of these cases are under 5 years old, of which about 5-16% of children have lower respiratory tract infections (pneumonia). (3)\nAccording to BSNT's share. Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao, pediatrician, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi: \"In the first months of 2023, cases of disease caused by Metapneumovirus tend to be more severe than in previous years. Currently, about ⅓ of cases of patients infected with Metapneumovirus in children are hospitalized with difficulty breathing, respiratory failure and requiring oxygen ventilator support.\n\nCauses of Metapneumovirus infection\nHuman Metapneumovirus can be transmitted directly from one person to another through virus-containing droplets released from the body by the patient when coughing, sneezing, running nose, talking, etc. This is also the way main transmission of this virus strain.\nIn addition, Metapneumovirus can survive for a long time in the air, on surfaces, objects and enter the body when we collide or come into contact with them.\n\nSubjects at risk of Metapneumovirus infection\nRespiratory infections caused by Metapneumovirus in children under 5 years old can cause dangerous complications if not detected and controlled properly.\nRespiratory disease caused by Metapneumovirus has a higher risk of occurring in the following subjects:\nChildren under 5 years old, especially newborns;; Elderly people, over 65 years old;; People with weakened immune systems: have a history of lung disease, asthma, emphysema, etc.; COPD patients;; People who are undergoing chemotherapy or have had organ transplant surgery...\nRespiratory infections caused by Metapneumovirus in children under 5 years old can cause dangerous complications if not detected and controlled properly.\n\nSymptoms of Metapneumovirus in humans\nAfter Metapneumovirus infection, patients will usually show symptoms after about 3-5 days of incubation. These symptoms are quite similar to the common cold, including:\nCough;; Stuffy nose, runny nose;; Sore throat;; Mild fever.\nAfter that, the disease can become more severe and turn into lower respiratory tract infection with symptoms such as:\nHigh fever;; Wheezing;; Cough with thick phlegm;; Shortness of breath;; Purple skin;; There are signs of respiratory failure.\n\nHow to diagnose Metapneumovirus infection\nRespiratory tract infections caused by Metapneumovirus can be diagnosed by testing\nTo diagnose respiratory infections caused by Metapneumovirus, the doctor will first check the patient's health status and medical history. Your doctor may then order tests to determine the specific cause of your condition. Performing testing will help detect the virus early, thereby supporting the process of diagnosis, prognosis and establishing appropriate and effective treatment regimens.\nTo perform this method, the doctor may perform a bronchoscopy and take a sample of secretions from the patient's nose or throat. The fluid sample will be tested for rapid antigen or PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing.\n“Currently, at Tam Anh General Hospital, Panel 2 testing for respiratory allergens is often performed to detect viruses that cause respiratory diseases, including Metapneumovirus. This test will usually have results within 24 hours. Therefore, the process of examination and selection of treatment methods is done quickly, patients have a better prognosis,\" Dr. Phuong Thao added.\nRespiratory tract infections caused by Metapneumovirus can be diagnosed by testing\n\nTreatment of human Metapneumovirus\nDiseases caused by Metapneumovirus currently have no specific treatment. Currently available treatments are mainly aimed at treating symptoms including:\nAntipyretic. In case the patient has a high fever, over 38.5 degrees, the doctor can give the patient Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen at the appropriate dose to lower body temperature;; Perform nasal decongestion method, can use aerosol medicine;; Replenish water and electrolytes;; Perform nebulization if the patient experiences spasms;; Support breathing with oxygen when the patient has respiratory failure. If the patient has severe respiratory failure, the patient will be supported with mechanical ventilation;\nIn addition, at Tam Anh General Hospital, to support the treatment of diseases caused by Metapneumovirus, doctors will combine other supportive measures such as physical therapy to support breathing and nutritional treatment to improve the patient's physical condition. core.\n\nMetapneumovirus complications in humans\nUsually, cases of disease caused by Metapneumovirus infection are mild. The disease can self-limit after about 7 days with appropriate care and treatment support. However, in some severe cases the disease can cause complications such as:\nBronchopneumonia;; Severe pneumonia causing respiratory failure;; Bronchiolitis.\nThese complications are often at higher risk in people with underlying medical conditions. For example, in patients with underlying bronchial asthma, when infected with Metapneumovirus, the disease can trigger acute asthma attacks of varying severity, threatening the patient's life.\n\nPrevention of human Metapneumovirus\nBeing fully vaccinated and limiting contact in crowded places is the best way to prevent disease caused by Metapneumovirus.\nBeing fully vaccinated and limiting contact in crowded places is the best way to prevent disease caused by Metapneumovirus.\nCurrently, there is no vaccine to prevent Metapneumovirus. Therefore, to reduce the risk of respiratory diseases caused by Metapneumovirus, proactively implementing good disease prevention methods is extremely important. These methods include:\nFollow a nutritious diet;; Provide enough water for the body every day;; Get fully vaccinated to increase resistance and reduce the risk of disease;; Create an airy and clean living environment;; Implement measures to reduce contact such as: wearing masks when going to crowded places, limiting going to crowded places when there is an epidemic,...; Regularly clean and disinfect household surfaces, personal belongings and children's toys; Develop the habit of washing your hands every day, especially after going to the bathroom and before eating;; Exercise and play sports regularly every day.\nFor more information about care and health issues, you can contact the hospital at:\nIn general, Metapneumovirus cases are often mild and can go away on their own through treatment and home care. However, in some cases the disease can still seriously affect the health and threaten the patient's life. Therefore, when there are any signs of serious illness (continuous high fever, difficulty breathing, cyanosis, dehydration, etc.), the patient needs to be taken to the hospital for immediate treatment support.",
