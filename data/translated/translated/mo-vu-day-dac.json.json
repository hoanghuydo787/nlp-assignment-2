    "content": "What is dense breast tissue? Causes, diagnosis, significance and risks\n\nIf your recent mammogram shows you have dense breast tissue, you may wonder what this means for your breast cancer risk. Doctors say dense breast tissue makes breast cancer screening more difficult and increases the risk of breast cancer. So what is dense breast tissue? What are its causes, diagnosis, significance and risks?\n\nWhat is dense breast tissue?\nDense breast tissue is detected on a mammogram. This is a normal and common finding, especially in young menstruating women.\nBreast tissue includes milk glands, milk ducts, connective tissue, and fatty tissue. On mammograms, women with dense breasts have more connective tissue than fatty tissue.\nOn a mammogram, breast tissue is not dense, dark and transparent. Dense breast tissue appears as a solid white area on a mammogram, making it difficult to detect lesions on the breast.\n\nHow does dense breast tissue affect density?\nThere is an increased chance that breast cancer may go undetected with a mammogram, as dense breast tissue can hide underlying cancer.\n1. Dense breast tissue makes it difficult to see cancer on mammograms\nDense breast tissue (fibrous and glandular) appears white on a mammogram. Tumors and cancers are also white. So, dense tissues can make them more difficult to see. In contrast, fatty tissue looks almost black on a mammogram, so it's easier to see a white lump if most of the breast is fatty tissue. [first]\n2. Women with dense breast tissue have a higher risk of breast cancer\nIt is still unclear why breast tissue thickening is associated with breast cancer risk. It may be because dense breast tissue has more cells, which develop into abnormal cells. [2]\nDense breast tissue appears white on a mammogram.\n\nCauses of dense breast tissue\nIt's unclear why some women have more dense breast tissue and others don't.\nYoung people: your breast tissue tends to become less dense as you get older, although some women can develop dense breast tissue at any age.; Low BMI: Women with less body fat often have denser breast tissue than obese women.; Use of hormone therapy: women who use combination hormone therapy to relieve the signs and symptoms of menopause are more likely to have denser breast tissue.\n\nSigns and classification of dense breast tissue\nThe doctor analyzing your mammogram will determine the ratio of non-dense tissue to dense tissue and prescribe the degree of breast density.\nThe degree of attenuation was described using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). The degree of breast tissue density is often recorded by letters:\nA – Almost entirely adipose tissue: the breast is almost entirely adipose tissue. About 1 in 10 women have this result.; B – Scattered fibrous breast tissue: scattered areas of fibroglandular density but most of the breast tissue is not dense. About 4 in 10 women have this result.; C – Heterogeneous dense breast tissue: density is not uniform, most breast tissue is dense. About 4 in 10 women have this result.; D – Extremely dense breast tissue: extremely dense indicates that nearly all of the breast tissue is dense. About 1 in 10 women have this result.\nIn short, women with breasts classified as type C or D are considered to have dense breast tissue. Half of women who have mammograms have dense breasts.\nDense breast tissue increases the risk of breast cancer.\n\nHow to diagnose dense breast tissue?\nThere is some evidence that additional tests may increase the likelihood of detecting cancer in dense breast tissue [3]. Additional breast cancer screening tests include:\n3-D mammogram: Tomosynthesis uses X-rays to collect multiple images of the breast from many angles. The images are synthesized by a computer into a 3-dimensional image. Mammography centers are transitioning to incorporate 3D mammography as part of standard mammography technology.\nAdvantage:; It is estimated that about 1 additional cancer per 1,000 women is detected.; Done at the same time as a standard mammogram.; Reduces the need for additional examination of non-cancerous areas of concern.; Useful in evaluating dense breast tissue.; Cons: Exposure to additional radiation, although levels are still low.\nBreast MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): uses magnets to create images of the breast. MRI does not use radiation. Women at high risk of breast cancer, who have genetic mutations that increase the risk of cancer, are recommended to have a breast MRI.\nAdvantages: An estimated 14 additional cancers are detected per 1,000 women. No additional radiation exposure. Popular.; An estimated 14 additional cancers per 1,000 women were detected.; No additional radiation exposure.; Popular.; Cons: Likely to find areas of concern that aren't cancerous, but require additional imaging or a biopsy. Request contrast injection. The test is expensive and may not be covered by insurance unless there is a high risk of cancer.; Potentially finding areas of concern that are not cancerous, but require additional imaging or a biopsy.; Request injection of contrast material.; The test is expensive and may not be covered by insurance unless there is a high risk of cancer.\nBreast ultrasound: uses sound waves to analyze tissue in suspicious areas on a mammogram.\nAdvantages: Estimated to detect 2 - 4 more cancers per 1,000 women. No additional radiation exposure. Popular.; It is estimated that 2 - 4 more cancers will be detected per 1,000 women.; No additional radiation exposure.; Popular.\nCons: Likely to find areas of concern that aren't cancerous, but require additional scans or biopsies. Quality depends on the experience of the performer; Potentially finding areas of concern that are not cancerous, but require additional scans or biopsies.; Quality depends on the experience of the performer.\nHalf of women who have mammograms have dense breasts.\n\nTreating dense breast tissue has a risk of breast cancer\nThere is currently no clear evidence that reducing breast density reduces the risk of breast cancer. For women with dense breast tissue, they should see a doctor for advice to screen for breast cancer risk.\n\nPrevention and care for breast thickening\n1. Get a mammogram every year\nMost breast cancers can be seen on mammograms even in women with dense breast tissue. Therefore, regular mammograms are very important. [4]\nEven if women have a normal mammogram, they should still know what their breasts normally look and feel like. Whenever there are changes, you should immediately go to reputable medical facilities for examination.\nBreast self-examination helps women recognize abnormal breast changes early.\nMaintain appropriate weight: if you are at a normal weight, try to maintain it. If you are overweight, you should talk to your doctor about healthy weight loss strategies by reducing your calorie intake.\nRegular physical activity: try to exercise regularly for at least 30 minutes a day. If you do not regularly exercise, you should consult your doctor to come up with a suitable exercise schedule.\n\nFrequently asked questions about dense breast tissue\n1. Is dense breast tissue a risk factor for breast cancer?\nDense breast tissue is not considered an abnormal breast condition or disease but it is a risk factor for breast cancer. Women with dense fibroglandular tissue have a higher risk of breast cancer than women with fatty breasts. This risk is separate from the effect of dense breast tissue on mammogram readability. [5]\n2. Should women with dense breasts be screened for breast cancer?\nDepending on each person's condition, the doctor will order ultrasound, mammography, and MRI to screen for breast cancer. [6]\nMost breast cancers can be seen on a mammogram.\nTherefore, women need to pay attention, check themselves and immediately visit reputable medical facilities for timely detection. At the Breast Surgery Department, Tam Anh General Hospital brings together leading experts and good doctors with many years of experience to help patients feel secure in their treatment.\nDense breast tissue is not too much to worry about, but the higher the breast density, the higher the risk of breast cancer. Hopefully through the above article, women can better understand the causes and diagnosis of dense breast tissue. At the same time, you will also know how to self-examine, monitor and have regular examinations to promptly treat related mammary diseases.",
