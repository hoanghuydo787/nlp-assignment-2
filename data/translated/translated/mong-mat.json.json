    "content": "Pterygium (pterygium): Causes, symptoms and prevention\n\nPterygium is an overgrowth of the conjunctiva, mainly caused by long-term exposure to UV rays. In mild cases, the patient's eyes may be red, swollen and uncomfortable. If pterygium develops, vision will be obstructed or blurred. So what are the causes, symptoms and how to prevent pterygium?\n\nWhat disease is pterygium (pterygium)?\nPterygium (pterygium) is the proliferation of conjunctival cells forming a wing-shaped or triangular area protruding from the white of the eye. The disease develops from the corner of the eye, then spreads outward or towards the cornea. Pterygium can affect 1 or 2 eyes but usually does not occur at the same time. [first]\n\nHow are ocular pterygium classified?\n1. According to the World Health Organization (WHO)\nGrade 1 – Pterygium extends to the edge of the cornea.; Grade 2 – Pterygium extends to between the edge of the cornea and the edge of the pupil.; Grade 3 – Pterygium invades the pupil edge; Grade 4 – Pterygium invades and covers the pupil.\n2. According to the degree of invasion into the cornea\nRelative to the center of the cornea, pterygium in the eye has 3 levels:\nGrade 1 (<2mm),.; Grade 2 (2 – 4mm).; Grade 3 (> 4mm).\n3. According to anatomy\nBased on the radius of the cornea, pterygium in the eye has the following 4 levels:\nGrade 1 – The pterygoid tip extends through the corneal limbus.; Grade 2 – The pterygoid tip is less than 1/2 of the corneal radius.; Grade 3 – The pterygoid tip extends beyond 1/2 of the corneal radius.; Grade 4 – The pterygium encroaches on the pupil.\n4. According to the level of prognosis\nBased on prognosis, pterygium in the eye has 2 types:\nProgressive pterygium has a serrated head, thick body, many blood vessels and easily recurs after surgery.; Fibrous pterygium has a round head, solid white color, does not progress and rarely recurs.\n\nCause of dreamy eyes\nSome common causes of pterygium include [2]:\n1. Ultraviolet rays\nPeople whose jobs spend a lot of time outdoors are at high risk of developing pterygium.\n2. Genetics\nSome researchers say that patients with a family history of pterygium have a higher risk than others.\n3. Other risk factors\nPatients with a history of dry eyes: If the patient has or is having dry eyes, they are susceptible to pterygium; Exposure to irritants: Dust, sand and wind can aggravate dry eyes.\nPterygium can increase in size and spread to the cornea, causing blurred or double vision\n\nCommon signs of pterygium\nCommon signs of pterygium in patients that are easily recognizable are as follows [3]:\nA small pink patch slightly protruding above the eye.; Red, irritated or swollen eyes; Dry, itchy or burning eyes; Feeling like there is sand or grit in the eyes.; Eyes filled with tears.; When pterygium increases in size and spreads, causing blurred or double vision (if pterygium develops on the cornea).\nIf your eyes feel itchy or uncomfortable and you see a growth on the surface of your eye, see an ophthalmologist as soon as possible. Pterygium is benign and can be treated. If left for a long time, the disease will cause discomfort and affect future vision problems.\n\nSubjects susceptible to pterygium (pterygia)\nAnyone can get pterygium, but age, gender and geographic location characteristics can increase the risk:\nPeople between 20 and 40 years old are more likely to have dreamy eyes.; Men are 2 times more likely to have pterygium than women; People living near the equator are at higher risk due to exposure to stronger ultraviolet light.\n\nAre pterygium in the eye dangerous?\nPterygium in the eye in the early stages does not affect vision but is not aesthetically pleasing. Symptoms in the early stages may include irritation, itching or burning, which patients can use eye drops to treat. Patients should avoid exposure to sunlight and wind to reduce stimulation of larger pterygium development. Small pterygium that stops growing is relatively harmless and may not require further treatment. [4]\nHowever, in some cases, pterygium can develop and obstruct vision or distort the shape of the cornea and cause blurred vision (astigmatism). In this case, surgery is recommended.\nPterygium is not cancerous – a benign tumor. Therefore, pterygium only develops locally, only affects vision and does not spread to other parts of the body. However, go to the hospital for an examination to rule out serious diseases, such as conjunctival or iris tumors.\n\nHow are fatty pterygium and pterygium in the eye different?\nFatty pterygium and pterygium can be identified through the following characteristics [5]:\nPterygium is a white or yellow tumor that appears on the white of the eye. The tumor does not overlap the cornea and does not have any symptoms.; Pterygium is a growth in the size of the conjunctiva, has many blood vessels inside and can spread to the cornea.\n\nHow to diagnose pterygium in the eye?\nTo diagnose pterygium, the doctor will use a slit lamp. This device helps doctors examine the patient's cornea and iris lens. Additionally, your doctor may need additional tests such as:\nVision test: Check the patient's vision to see whether the letters or symbols on the chart are 6 meters away; Evaluate corneal shape: Use a computer to create a 3D map to take a panoramic view of the cornea to detect abnormalities.\nThe doctor may take pictures of the patient's eyes to monitor changes in the development of the pterygium over time. Additionally, other tests may be ordered to rule out other conditions, such as cancers affecting the eyes.\nMaster Doctor Pham Huy Vu Tung, Ophthalmology specialist, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City\n\nMethods of treating pterygium in the eye\nTreatment will depend on the severity of the individual condition. Treatment methods for pterygium in the eye (cloud pulling) include:\n1. Eye drops\nEye drops are often used to treat mild irritation and soothe the cornea. For severe conditions, an ophthalmologist may prescribe steroid eye drops for a short time and must be prescribed in small doses and frequency by the doctor. This medication only relieves symptoms and is not a cure.\n2. Surgery\nSurgery is the only treatment that can remove pterygium. Pterygium should be removed before the disease develops on the cornea. Pterygium in the eye, when spreading to the cornea, can cause corneal scarring and permanently affect vision.\n3. Protection against ultraviolet radiation\nIf the pterygium is small, painless and does not cause vision problems, the patient should wear a hat and sunglasses when exposed to outdoor sunlight. Protecting the eyes from UV radiation will prevent the development of pterygium. In addition, patients can use sunglasses to help shield their eyes from ultraviolet rays entering the eyes.\n\nHow to prevent dreamy eyes?\nTo prevent dreamy eyes, each person should take the following measures:\nActively protect your eyes from ultraviolet radiation by wearing a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses with lenses designed to block ultraviolet rays when outdoors. When going out, you need to wear sunglasses to block wind, dust and sand.; Avoid dry or warm climates, smoky and windy environments, as they can cause inflammation and worsen pterygium symptoms, such as dryness and irritation of the eyes.; Regularly notice if there are any changes in your eyes. If you have a pterygium, regularly observe its size, color and shape. In addition, when you notice any unusual symptoms in your eyes, go to the hospital for timely diagnosis and treatment by a doctor.; To minimize the risk of recurrence after pterygium surgery, it is necessary to limit exposure to ultraviolet rays.\nOphthalmology Department, Tam Anh General Hospital has a team of doctors with high expertise and many years of experience in treating eye diseases. In addition, with a system of modern machinery and equipment imported genuine from European and American countries, it helps improve the condition of pterygium effectively.\nHopefully, through the above article, each person will not feel confused or worried if they have pterygium (pterygia). However, if the patient notices that pterygium is increasingly growing, causing uncomfortable symptoms and lack of eye aesthetics, please go to the hospital so that an ophthalmologist can diagnose and provide an effective treatment regimen.",
