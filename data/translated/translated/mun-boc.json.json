    "content": "What is cystic acne? Identification characteristics of common types today\n\nAcne conglobata is a rare form of acne but is more severe than other types of acne. Abscesses deep under the skin can join together, create scars or cause facial disfigurement if not treated properly.\n\nWhat is cystic acne?\nCystic acne is a condition of large, lumpy, inflamed acne with nodules (cystic nodules). Acne spots develop deep under the skin, spread and are large in size. Cysts can also progress to pus and can cause abscesses. The abscesses can connect and form larger pockets, or create  “tunnels” under the skin. The pus coming out has a foul smell.\nAlthough cystic acne is considered a serious dermatological condition, medical treatments can help treat acne, reducing the risk of scarring. Patients need to see a dermatologist to get appropriate treatment for their acne condition.\nCommon places for acne to appear: on the shoulders, chest, upper arms, buttocks, face and thighs.\n\nSymptoms of common types of cysts\nCystic acne is manifested as red, hard, swollen pimples around the pimples, with yellow or white fluid and pus inside the pimples, painful to the touch, easy to break and leave long-lasting dark spots.\nAcne is classified according to mild, moderate or severe severity. In addition, acne is also classified according to the nature and morphology of acne, including:\n1. Acne has a nucleus\nCystic acne often appears in large clumps, without white heads; feels hard and painful to the touch. Acne is located deep in the skin and hair follicles, so treatment time is longer than other acne. If treated incorrectly, acne will spread to the surrounding skin and easily recur.\n2. Cysts without cores\nIn contrast to cystic acne, cystic acne without a nucleus has the shape of a large lump, without a white tip; hard, rough and painful to the touch, especially when the acne is swollen. In fact, this type of acne has a core but is located deep under the skin and hair follicles, making it difficult to treat.\n3. Acne is calloused\nWhen acne is not completely removed, it will hide deep under the skin, causing hardened acne. Easily visible signs are dry, hard acne cores and black pimples; causes uneven skin tone and loss of aesthetics.\n4. Acne with pus\nThe cause is due to bacterial colonies forming on skin that is in a state of severe inflammation. At first it was just a hard nodule, then it swelled with pain. When a pimple bursts, the secretions include pus and blood. This type of acne easily leaves dark spots and pitted scars.\n5. Acne has fluid\nAcne is characterized by the presence of fluid inside, including pus and blood. Vesicles often appear on the eyelids, around the mouth, lips, lips, etc., causing redness, swelling, pain, and itching.\n6. Acne with blood\nThe easily recognizable shape is large round pimples, containing pus and blood inside, with a round white pus tip. Acne with blood is common during puberty. When acne bursts, if not treated properly, it can spread to the surrounding skin, causing new acne to grow, and the acne skin condition becomes even more serious.\n7. Whitehead acne\nWhitehead acne is quite similar to milk acne in young children, often growing in T-zone locations such as the forehead, nose, cheeks, chin; back, shoulders... Acne forms from a reaction between bacteria and immune cells surrounded by red, inflamed tissue. Occurs at all ages. Acne that lasts for a long time will form acne.\n\nDevelopment stage of acne\nImage of acne on skin\nStage 1: Acne is attacked by bacteria, turning into small, cystic acne; Stage 2: The pimple swells, then forms a nucleus, containing white or yellow pus; Stage 3: The pimple matures and bursts, possibly accompanied by blood.\n\nCauses of acne\nAs with most types of acne, there is no definitive answer as to why cystic acne develops. Cystic acne often begins as typical acne, gradually becoming more severe. Sometimes acne appears quite suddenly, long after the previous acne has been cured. (first)\nCauses considered include:\nBecause the body overreacts to Propionibacterium acnes bacteria (acne-causing bacteria) and causes severe inflammation and acne development.; Sex. Cystic acne often occurs in men, especially white men, and is usually between the ages of 20 and 30. Acne can progress for many years. Cystic acne is uncommon in women and rare in children or the elderly.; Trigger factor. Cystic acne tends to form due to a trigger. Because it often occurs in men, testosterone is considered a contributing factor to acne formation.; Bodybuilders use anabolic steroids (to help improve physical fitness). If you develop severe acne and use steroids during exercise, let your doctor know about this so that acne can be treated effectively.; Other agents such as androgen hormones and thyroid medications. Polycystic ovary syndrome in women may be a potential cause. Cystic acne also occurs in men treated with testosterone and may appear after treatment.; Genetic. Common acne can be hereditary, especially severe forms of acne such as cystic acne. Cystic acne also commonly appears in people with associated hidradenitis suppurativa and pyoderma gangrenosum.\n\nShould acne be squeezed?\nDo not squeeze acne. The reason is that when you use unsanitary hands to squeeze acne, bacteria from your hands will enter the open wound, causing inflammation of the pores and that area of ​​skin. The infection becomes severe and spreads deep under the skin and can form an abscess. At that time, treatment will be difficult and may leave scars after treatment.\n\nWhen should I see a doctor?\nFor acne, you should see a doctor if you have tried other treatments but have not found them effective. In addition, patients should also see a doctor when they notice acne spreading deep under the skin; Acne appears along with joint pain, nausea, fever, diarrhea...\n\nTreatments\nThe Dermatologist will consider the lesions and family history of dermatological diseases or inflammatory skin conditions.; Tests that can be considered include blood count to know the level of infection, dermatoscopy to know oily skin condition, vascular proliferation and skin pigmentation.; As for treatment, options include simple (over-the-counter) treatment, medication, or surgery. However, over-the-counter medications such as salicylic acid or topical medications are not applicable to cystic or cystic acne because they only treat the upper layers of skin. Therefore, your doctor may recommend a combination of topical medications, prescription oral medications, and scar medications.\n1. Treatment is simply with topical medication\nTreatment alone will not be effective for acne. Therefore, dermatologists recommend combining it with oral medications for better results. The most popular options include: benzoyl peroxide (removes sebum, dead skin cells), corticosteroids (reduces inflammation)…\n2. Oral medications\nOral antibiotics treat acne; Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and anti-swelling drugs; The prescription acne medication isotretinoin is commonly used to treat cystic acne. It works by blocking excess sebum in pores.; Topical retinoids are not as effective as oral retinoids. Note, do not use retinoids for women of childbearing age. (2)\nOther medications include: minocycline, tetracycline or doxycycline. Tetracycline should not be combined with oral isotretinoin because it can cause increased pressure inside the skull.\nIf no response to the above medications, dapsone or infliximab, carbon dioxide laser (with or without isotretinoin) may be prescribed.; If advanced cystic acne does not respond to the above treatments, another option is external beam radiation.\nWomen with cystic acne who are taking birth control pills or anti-androgens may benefit from acne relief. Testosterone or certain hormone medications may be helpful in treating acne.\nTreatment of acne needs to be based on the type of acne and the level of damage caused by the acne\n3. Surgical treatment of scars\nYour doctor may recommend surgery to treat scars if they are severe; Indications for use of steroids to reduce inflammation; Skin grafting techniques can be used to treat scars by taking tissue from other areas of the body to fill the affected area.; Both surgery and skin grafting help reduce discomfort and cosmetic concerns in patients.\n\nComplications of acne can occur\nAs the skin condition heals, dark spots may appear. Your dermatologist may recommend treating your scars with dermabrasion or chemical peels.; Deformation of damaged skin can be a serious complication of acne. Therefore, patients should treat acne as soon as possible, the less risk of developing deformities or scars due to tissue breakdown and deformation.; Acne after treatment can leave behind acne scars. Acne contains keratin, the main component of the external skin structure; Side effects associated with drugs such as Accutane (depression, especially in adolescents; pregnancy complications, sun sensitivity, sunburn); Isotretinoin (dry facial skin, lips; nosebleeds; unusual mood changes; do not use during pregnancy)…\n\nCare and prevention\nClean your face and body every day with gentle shower gel and shampoo products. For facial skin, gently wash with warm water and gentle cleanser twice a day to remove excess oil. You should wash with clean hands or a clean, soft wet towel, do not use a dry towel to avoid friction that can cause further irritation to the skin.\nAvoid using products that can irritate the skin such as cosmetics or sunscreen. In particular, do not touch your face, do not squeeze acne... to avoid worsening acne, leading to infection or scarring.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with a Dermatologist at Tam Anh General Hospital System, you can choose from the following options:\nRed, swollen cystic acne is the most serious condition among all types of acne. Therefore, it is necessary to take care of the skin and treat it properly to avoid possible complications such as causing facial deformation, affecting aesthetics, creating negative psychology, low self-esteem, etc.",
