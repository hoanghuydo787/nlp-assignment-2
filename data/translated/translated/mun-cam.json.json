This causes clogged pores, leading to acne; Inappropriate skin care products: using cosmetics or facial cleansers for the wrong skin type, a skin condition that seems simple but is a silent \"killer\" that causes the skin to increase or decrease sebum secretion, affecting the skin process. secretion of pores.
