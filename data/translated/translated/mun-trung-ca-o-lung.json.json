The bacteria that cause back acne from here also have favorable conditions to multiply and attack.; Not showering after sweating a lot: This is one of the poor hygiene habits that not only increases the risk of acne on the back, but also other areas such as the chest, arms, and neck. In addition to acne, not cleaning the body when sweating a lot also leads to many other skin diseases.; Using inappropriate products: Some cosmetic products such as shampoo, shower gel, lotion, etc. can cause skin irritation or affect the skin's sebum secretion, causing the skin to become more oily.
