    "content": "Acne: Causes, symptoms and risks you need to know\n\nAcne is a chronic inflammation of the sebaceous hair follicles. The disease is common in hospitals and dermatology departments. Acne occurs at all ages but is most concentrated in teenagers.\n\nWhat is acne?\nAcne is a form of sebaceous follicle disease, with skin lesions caused by increased sebum secretion, deposited in the pores, accompanied by inflammation in the sebaceous follicles. The disease occurs in all ages, especially acne during puberty, or people with oily skin. (first)\nIf not treated properly and do not comply with treatment, the disease becomes more severe, leaving sequelae that are difficult to treat, causing the patient to feel guilty, have low self-esteem in communication, and reduce work efficiency.\nIn all cases, acne needs to be treated early, properly and sufficiently at medical facilities to reduce its severity and completely suppress the disease. From there, prevent and reduce the loss of aesthetics caused by acne scars.\n\nMechanism and causes of acne formation\nThe mechanism that causes acne is determined by the following 4 factors:\nIncreased sebum secretion: includes endocrine factors and non-endocrine factors (soap, having oily skin, increased level of sebum secretion...).; Sebaceous duct keratinization disorder: narrows or even blocks the sebum drainage pathway, causing sebum stagnation.\nWhen the hair follicle, especially the neck of the sebaceous gland, becomes keratinized, causing the sebaceous secretion duct to narrow, causing sebum to stagnate in the lumen of the sebaceous gland. If superinfection does not occur, the sebum condenses into acne (about 30 days). If superinfection occurs, the sebaceous gland will produce pus, the infection spreads to other sebaceous glands, causing cystic acne and inflammatory acne.\nBacteria: streptococcus, staphylococcus and especially Cuti Bacterium acnes in the sebaceous ducts. This is the most important bacteria in the pathogenesis of acne. It is an anaerobic gram-positive bacteria that grows best in pH conditions of 5-5.6 and temperature of 30-37 degrees Celsius. The human body has an increased sebum secretion and thickened hair follicles. The residue is a condition for anaerobic bacteria to grow. Among them, Cuti Bacterium acnes plays a major role in the development of acne; Inflammation: appearance of acne-causing bacteria, creating biological substances. These substances activate the complement system and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, causing folliculitis.\nAcne often appears in skin areas with many oil (sebaceous) glands such as the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders. Hair follicles are connected to oil glands.\nThe cyst wall can swell and create whiteheads or blackheads due to enlarged pores. To the naked eye, blackheads can look like dirt stuck in pores. However, acne forms because pores are clogged with accumulated oil and bacteria, and when exposed to air, they turn dark brown.\n\nSymptoms of acne formation\nDepending on the severity of acne, the signs of acne will be different: (2)\nWhiteheads are caused by clogged pores; Blackheads are caused by enlarged pores; Small red, tender bumps (papules); Pimples (pustules), are papules with pus at the tip; Large, solid, painful lumps under the skin (nodules); Pain, pus under the skin (cystic lesions)\nAcne often appears on the face, forehead, chest, upper back, and shoulders.\n\nComplications of acne\nComplications of acne often occur in people with darker skin, including:\nScars: Complications of pitted skin (acne scars) and thickened skin (keloid scars) can persist long after the acne has healed.; Skin changes: after acne clears, the affected skin area may be darker (hyperpigmentation) or lighter (hypopigmentation) than before the acne.\n\nRisk factors for developing acne\nBesides the causes, the risk factors below also contribute significantly to promoting the occurrence and severity of acne. These include:\nBesides the main causes, acne is also caused by lifestyle, diet...\n1. Age\nDuring puberty, hormones are not balanced, causing sebaceous glands to become overactive, leading to clogged pores and acne. After age 20, the hormones have stabilized, acne will decrease and appear less frequently. However, acne, even cystic acne, pus... still occurs in people after the age of 20. Causes can come from environmental factors, stress, eating greasy foods...\n2. Hormonal changes\nMale hormones (androgens), especially testosterone, stimulate sebum secretion, high doses of progesterone have a stimulating effect, low doses have an inhibitory effect. High doses of estrogen have an inhibitory effect. Pituitary hormones directly stimulate the sebaceous glands. The above factors explain the relationship between acne, which often occurs during puberty or is related to the menstrual cycle.\n3. Genetics\nIf both parents have acne, there is a chance that their children may also have acne.\n4. Cleansing\nOverusing soap stimulates increased sebum secretion, increasing the risk of acne formation.\n5. Environment\nAnimal fats in the environment, fast food restaurants, and mechanical workers are regularly exposed to engine lubricants, humidity, and ultraviolet rays. Increased moisture on the skin surface in hot and humid climates can increase the severity of acne, due to blockage of sebaceous follicle ducts.\n6. Diet foods\nLow glycemic index diet. Cutting out processed meat and refined carbs can help reduce acne damage.; Dairy products: the consumption of some dairy products, and dairy products, appears to aggravate acne. However, non-dairy dairy products (such as cheese) do not appear to worsen acne.; Fats and fatty acids: omega -3 and omega-6 fatty acids may help reduce acne.; Vegetarianism: Although vegan and vegetarian diets may have many health benefits, there is little evidence that they help treat acne.; Probiotics: Although probiotics found in yogurt, fermented foods, supplements, etc. can help improve acne, experts have yet to see the benefits of probiotics. in the treatment of this dermatological condition.\n7. Friction or pressure on the skin\nThe process of rubbing objects such as phones, mobile phones, helmets, necklaces, backpacks too tightly... or regularly wearing masks or poor quality masks, affecting the skin is also considered a causes of acne.\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nIf prolonged self-care measures don't clear your acne or your acne becomes severe, see a dermatologist to find a regimen that's right for each individual.\nFor women who often suffer from acne, often having acne outbreaks one week before their menstrual period or using birth control methods, the acne can go away on its own without treatment.; In older adults, the sudden onset of severe acne may signal an underlying condition that requires treatment.; The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that some over-the-counter acne lotions and cleansers can cause serious reactions. Although these reactions are quite rare, you should pay attention to redness, irritation or itching that occurs in areas where medication or cream has been applied.; In addition, if you experience symptoms such as fainting; shortness of breath; swelling of the eyes, face, lips, or tongue; tight throat… after using skin care products, you should seek emergency medical attention.\n\nTreatments\nTreatment of acne depends on the condition and severity of the acne:\n1. Mild level\nPatients can use over-the-counter creams, cleansers, or topical treatments to treat acne. Common ingredients found in acne creams and gels include:\nBenzoyl peroxide: helps dry out acne, prevents new acne from forming and kills acne-causing bacteria; Salicylic acid: helps exfoliate the skin, preventing pores from being clogged by acne-causing bacteria.\nNew generation skin scanner at Dermatology Department - Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, supporting the diagnosis of dermatological problems including acne\n2. Moderate level\nIf after a few weeks of over-the-counter acne treatment the symptoms still do not go away, the patient should see a dermatologist. Your doctor may prescribe medications to help relieve symptoms and prevent scarring.\nIf you have moderate acne, your dermatologist may recommend:\nBenzoyl peroxide (prescription dosage); Antibiotics (such as erythromycin or clindamycin); Retinoids (like retinol)\nIn some cases, your doctor may recommend an oral antibiotic or hormonal birth control to help control acne.\nUsually, patients use antibiotics for a short time, so the body does not form resistance and the body is susceptible to infection.\nSeverity level\nFor severe acne, your dermatologist may recommend a combination of one or more of the following treatments:\nOral antibiotics; Benzoyl peroxide; Topical antibiotics; Topical retinoids\nA dermatologist may also recommend hormone control medications or oral isotretinoin, also known as Accutane. This is a type of vitamin A used in the treatment of severe acne. The medicine can cause serious side effects. Therefore, doctors only prescribe it when other treatments are ineffective.\n\nLifestyle and prevention\nAlthough you cannot completely prevent acne, you can take steps at home to reduce the risk of acne occurring. Specific jobs include: (3)\nWash your face daily with an oil-free cleanser; Use an over-the-counter acne cleanser to help remove excess oil.; Use makeup that is water-based or labeled “hypoallergenic” to reduce clogged pores and acne.; Avoid skin care and makeup products that contain oils.; Remove makeup and clean skin thoroughly before going to bed.; Take a shower or wash your face after exercising.; Tie your hair (if it's long) so it doesn't obscure your face; Avoid wearing hats, tight headbands, and clothing in acne-prone areas; Maintain a balanced diet and drink enough water.; Reduce stress.\nIn addition, dermatologists can give advice and instructions on \"personalized\" skin care to prevent acne.",
