    "content": "Fungus of the external auditory canal: Causes, signs and treatments\n\nFungal external auditory canal is an infection of the external auditory canal caused by fungal agents. If not treated promptly, the disease can progress seriously and can cause perforated eardrums, affecting hearing.\nExternal ear canal fungus is a common disease, more common in immunocompromised patients\n\nWhat is external ear canal fungus?\nFungal external auditory canal is an infection of the external auditory canal caused by fungal agents. This is a fairly common ear, nose and throat disease, causing persistent discomfort for the patient if not treated properly.\nThe disease often appears in tropical climates with high humidity. Although the symptoms usually only occur in the external auditory canal and are not life-threatening, they can progress to severe causes perforating the eardrum, causing hearing loss, and invasive temporal bone infection if not recognized and treated promptly. .\n\nWhich patients are susceptible to fungal infections of the external ear canal?\nMSc.BSc.CKI Ho Van Huu, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, said that Aspergillus and Candida fungi are two common agents that cause fungal diseases of the external ear canal. The disease can occur at any age and can affect one or both ears at the same time.\nWhen there are impacts that change the ear canal environment, it can lead to fungal infection of the external ear canal, for example:\nPatients with earwax plugs;; Chronic perforated otitis media with symptoms of persistent ear discharge;; Patients after surgery have ear canal shaping;; Prolonged use of antibacterial ear drops;; Patients undergoing radiotherapy to the head and neck area;; Damage to the ear canal due to injury or the habit of cleaning the ear or using headphones or hearing aids;; People who like to play water sports;; People with skin diseases related to the outer ear or fungal diseases in other organs;; Immunocompromised patients change the normal bacterial flora in the ear canal, creating opportunities for fungi to grow.(1)\n\nSigns of fungus in the external ear canal\nDoctor Ho Van Huu said that the clinical manifestations of external ear canal fungus are very diverse, patients may have no symptoms and are only discovered by chance through otoscopy. Some cases may experience symptoms, including:\nItchy ears;; Ear discharge: often has a foul smell and is cloudy;; Ear pain: increased by stimulation such as pulling the earlobe or pressing on the ear flap; can cause temporomandibular joint pain;; Tinnitus: feeling of fullness in the ears;; Hearing loss: when fungal plaques block the ear canal.\nExternal ear canal fungus can cause tinnitus and hearing loss\n\nDiagnosis method of external ear canal fungus\nDoctors exploit symptoms and otoscopy to diagnose external ear canal fungus. Otoscopic images include: ear canal swelling, congestion, pus in the ear canal, and especially characteristic fungal filaments or blue, black and white fungal plaques. In some cases, ear fungus has no symptoms or only has simple symptoms of prolonged ear itching, discovered accidentally through otoscopy, seeing fungal filaments growing on the earwax base.\nWhen determining the causes of ear pain and ear discharge, the doctor will prescribe appropriate treatment for cases of bacterial external otitis media, acute otitis media, chronic cholesteatoma... (2 )\nEndoscopic image of fungal external otitis\n\nComplications of fungal disease of the external auditory canal\nExternal ear canal fungus rarely causes complications. However, for immunocompromised patients such as HIV, diabetes, long-term corticosteroid use, cancer chemotherapy patients, etc., ear fungus can develop, symbiotically with bacteria or not. leading to complications such as perforated eardrum causing hearing loss, invasive mastoid necrosis causing mastoid otitis and in more severe cases can spread to the intracranial cavity causing meningitis.\n\nMethods of treating fungus in the external ear canal\nAccording to Dr. Ho Van Huu, the treatment method for external ear canal fungus is mainly topical treatment, specifically: removing and cleaning fungal pus, then using ear drops containing fungicide ingredients, rarely needed. to antibiotics and oral antifungals.\nIf the patient has an irritating fungal discharge causing ear inflammation, some accompanying topical medications can be used to eliminate the fungus and reduce symptoms.\nIn some cases, short-term pain relievers, anti-inflammatory, and anti-allergy medications can be used to quickly reduce symptoms.\nIn immunocompromised patients, if not responding to topical therapy, combination with oral antifungal medication as prescribed by the physician may be necessary.\nWhen there are complications of invasive necrotizing external otitis, the doctor may prescribe surgery to clear the fungus, combined with taking systemic antifungal medication.(3)\nWhen there are complications of invasive necrotizing external otitis, the doctor may prescribe surgery to clean the fungus\n\nHow to prevent fungal diseases of the external ear canal\nTo prevent fungal diseases of the external ear canal, doctor Ho Van Huu advises that everyone should clean their ears properly. When swimming, use earplugs and dry your ears afterward. Do not damage the ear and do not share earwax removal tools to avoid infection.\nIn immunocompromised patients, careful ear care and regular ear examination are required. Early detection of ear infections helps timely treatment, avoiding complications that cause eardrum perforation or temporal bone infection that spreads to the intracranial cavity.\nDiabetics with ear fungus should control their blood sugar levels to prevent complications of the disease.\nPatients after mastoid surgery to widen the ear canal should have their ears checked regularly to clean wax and ear scales, if any.\n\nFrequently asked questions about external ear canal fungus\n1. Is outer ear fungus contagious?\nOtitis externa is a fungal infection. The disease can spread from person to person if exposed to the fungus, especially in immunocompromised patients.\nSharing earwax removal tools increases the risk of fungal infection. Ear surgical instruments that are not thoroughly sterilized can also lead to this risk.\n2. Is external ear fungus dangerous?\nTypically, fungal infections of the external auditory canal only cause persistent discomfort limited to the patient's external auditory canal. Although rare, the disease can have invasive complications that cause bone destruction, mastoid infection, temporal bone infection if not treated promptly, and infection that spreads to the intracranial cavity can cause meningitis.\nMeningitis is a threat to life, especially in children and people with immunodeficiency diseases.\n3. Can external ear fungus go away on its own?\nFungal infections of the outer ear rarely go away without treatment. Patients need to see a doctor to receive appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The treatment regimen is usually clean ears combined with treatment with antifungal ear drops. In cases of complications of infection of the mastoid and temporal bones, surgical intervention may be required.\nExternal ear canal fungus is a fairly common Ear, Nose and Throat disease in our country due to hot and humid climate conditions, which are favorable for fungi to grow and cause disease. Due to its difficult to treat and persistent nature, with easy recurrence, patients need to be treated early and properly to avoid prolonging the disease, causing complications that affect hearing and even threaten life. External auditory canal fungi can cause complications of mastoiditis and temporal bone inflammation in immunocompromised patients.\nDoctor Ho Van Huu emphasized that treating fungal infections of the external ear canal with medication must be prescribed by a doctor. You should not buy antibiotics yourself to avoid antibiotic resistance when treating infections. after that.",
