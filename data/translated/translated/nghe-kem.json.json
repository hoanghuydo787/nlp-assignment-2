    "content": "What is hearing loss? causes, signs and treatments\n\nHearing loss (hearing loss) is becoming a common health problem. According to statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), it is estimated that about 5% of the population, equivalent to 360 million people worldwide, have hearing loss, including 32 million children under 15 years old. The number of people with hearing loss is also increasing due to the influence of many different causes. This article is expertly advised by Doctor Tran Thi Thuy Hang - Head of Ear, Nose and Throat Department - Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nWhat is hearing loss?\nHearing loss (hearing loss) is a condition in which a patient can hear sounds, but very poorly or may not be able to hear someone speak, even when they are using normal speech, or may only hear sounds very big. Hearing loss is also known as hearing loss, or hearing loss. On the subjective pure tone audiometry chart, hearing loss occurs when the hearing intensity of the ear is ≥ 25 dB (decibels).(1)\n\nSubjects often suffer from hearing loss\nHearing loss can appear at any age, however, the older you are, the higher the risk of hearing loss. About 80% of hearing loss occurs in older people. For people from the age of 60 onwards, there are few people who do not have hearing loss or whose hearing ability has not decreased compared to when they were young. In addition, hearing loss also occurs in children and people who work in noisy environments...\n1. Elderly people\nHearing loss affects more people over the age of 55-60 years old. However, hearing loss can appear after age 30, then every 10 years, the level of hearing loss gradually increases. The reason is that as people age, their organs will age, including the auditory nerve, which will also age or be completely destroyed. This leads to a decrease in the ear's ability to receive and transmit information, thereby causing hearing loss.(5)\nPeople working in noise environments: According to research, the dangerous sound intensity for the ears is from 85 decibels. Therefore, any loud sound with high intensity and prolonged duration can cause damage to structures in the ear, leading to hearing loss. People who work in noisy environments will suffer from hearing loss. Typically: Miners, carpenters, quarrymen, welders, builders, train drivers, people working in factories.\nLearn more about the causes, signs and treatments for hearing loss and hearing loss in the elderly.\n2. Sick people\nHearing loss is partly caused by diseases affecting the ears, especially related to infants and young children with ear infections and nasopharyngitis with ear complications. Typically, otitis media, inner ear inflammation, and meningitis. Research in the UK confirmed that among 432 children with meningitis in the UK, 59 children (13.7%) had hearing loss, of which 46 children (78%) had permanent sensorineural hearing loss, the remaining children had hearing loss. sensorineural deafness or unstable deafness. In addition, people with cardiovascular diseases, blood pressure and diabetes also have hearing loss because these diseases can obstruct blood flow to the ears.\n3. People have to take medicine\nSome medications have side effects that cause tinnitus, which can lead to hearing loss. In addition, drugs used to treat tuberculosis, cardiovascular disease, and cancer also have the effect of causing hearing loss in long-term users.\n4. People with injuries\nPeople with head and ear injuries can cause temporary or permanent hearing loss. Head trauma will cause perforation of the eardrum, fracture of the temporal bone and affect the structure of the inner ear, which can lead to hearing loss. However, hearing loss due to head injury is often detected late.\n\nCauses of hearing loss\n1. Hearing loss due to genetics\nGenetics is currently the leading cause of congenital hearing loss in children. Statistics show that about 50% of all cases of congenital hearing loss are due to genetics. There have been a number of studies that confirm that families with a parent who has hearing loss have a higher chance of having a hearing loss than other children.(2)\n2. Complications when the mother is pregnant\nMothers suffering from certain infections such as Rubella and syphilis during pregnancy can cause hearing loss or deafness in the children they give birth to. In addition, mothers taking drugs during pregnancy such as aminoglycosides, cytotoxics, antimalarial drugs and diuretics have the risk of causing congenital hearing loss. In addition, premature babies with low birth weight are also in the group of children with hearing loss due to pregnancy complications.\nEar infection, abnormal bone growth or tumor: If you have an ear infection, have an abnormal tumor in the outer or middle ear, or any complications of abnormal bone growth can also cause hearing loss.\n3. Perforated eardrum\nLoud explosion, sudden change in pressure, poking the eardrum with a sharp object. Infectious ear infections cause perforated eardrums.\n4. Earwax accumulation\nEarwax can block the ear canal and prevent the transmission of sound waves, thereby causing hearing loss.\n5. Medicine\nParticularly, antibiotics used to treat infections can affect the cochlea and vestibule such as gentamicin, streptomycin, and tobramycin. These drugs can kill bacteria but also cause hair cell death, thereby causing hearing loss.\n\nClassification of hearing loss\nSimulates the structure of the human ear\n1. Conductive hearing loss\nUsually the result of damage to the outer and middle ear. At that time, the sound transmission system including the earlobe, ear canal, eardrum and ossicles is damaged, so it no longer has the function of transmitting sound from the outside to the inside.\n2. Sensorineural hearing loss\nThis is a phenomenon in which the conduction organs function normally but the inner ear is seriously damaged. From there, the sound transmitted to the ears is not received and does not send information to the brain. This disease is often caused by damage to the cochlea, commonly found in the elderly, people working in noisy environments, and congenital deafness.\n3. Mixed hearing loss\nA mixture of conductive hearing loss and sensorineural hearing loss. Patients will suffer damage to many locations such as the outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear.\n\nSymptoms of hearing loss\nHearing loss has many symptoms to recognize, but the most typical is difficulty understanding what other people are saying and asking them to repeat or speak louder. People with hearing loss will have symptoms such as:\nFeeling voices and other sounds become smaller; Difficulty understanding other people's words, especially in crowded, noisy places; Hearing confused information, difficulty distinguishing sounds; Ears have ringing, squeaking, etc. or sounds that are not real; Frequently ask others to repeat, speak more slowly, and speak more clearly; Increasing the volume of phones, televisions, and radio speakers makes others uncomfortable because it is too loud; Can't keep up with the conversation because I don't understand what the other person is saying\n\nHow to treat hearing loss?\nCurrently, methods to restore hearing for patients depend on the cause of the phenomenon. For example, a normal person's sudden hearing loss may be due to a lot of earwax. Just removing the earwax will restore hearing. People with perforated eardrums can have surgery to repair the eardrum, however, according to Doctor Tran Thi Thuy Hang - Head of Ear, Nose and Throat Department - Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, there are also many patients with sensory organ degeneration. In the inner ear, a cochlear implant is required to regain hearing.(3)\nEarwax removal: By suction or a small tool with a ring on the end. Surgery: Surgery includes eardrum repair and ossicular chain correction. If the patient has repeated infections with persistent fluid, the doctor may insert a tympanostomy tube to help the ear drain fluid. Hearing aids: If hearing loss is due to inner ear damage, hearing aids will be helpful. Cochlear implant: Unlike hearing aids that amplify sound and direct it into the ear canal, cochlear implants help replace the function of damaged parts and directly stimulate the auditory nerve . This method was born in the 70s and has been widely deployed since the 90s. In Vietnam in the early 2000s, it was deployed in many hospitals. In particular, Tam Anh General Hospital applies modern equipment to cochlear implants, hearing loss treatment after ear surgery, achieving high efficiency in supporting patients to recover hearing after surgery. ; Earwax removal: By suction or a small tool with a ring on the end.; Surgery: Surgery includes eardrum repair and ossicular chain correction.

Adults also need to proactively protect their ears when working in noisy environments. Hearing loss in particular is very dangerous if it occurs in young children and infants and without timely intervention, it can lead to deafness and poor language development. Therefore, to prevent hearing loss we need to pay attention to the following: (4)\n1. Need to screen and test hearing function\nCurrently, Vietnam is among the countries with a high frequency of hearing loss but it is detected late due to not being screened for timely detection. With the development of medicine, it is now possible to measure ear function to check whether a patient has hearing loss or not, how severe it is, and what the cause of hearing loss is. Typically, Tam Anh General Hospital deploys soundproof rooms imported from Korea that meet 35 dB soundproofing standards, equipped with Resonance meter systems from Italy and Natus from the US that can measure hearing objectively, gently, without Cause pain with many different methods:\nMonotone audiometry Tympanometry OAE cochlear acoustics ABR brainstem electroaudiometry; Monotone audiometry; Tympanometry; Measure OAE cochlear sounds; Electro-auditory brainstem ABR measurement\nDoctor examines patient's ears\n2. Screening for hearing loss in children\nAccording to statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2020, more than 5% of the population will have hearing loss, of which children account for 9%. Therefore, early detection and screening plays an important role in the results of hearing loss intervention in young children.\nNewborns: Newborns need a hearing screening before leaving the hospital. If the child does not pass the screening test, parents must take the child to an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist for a hearing test. Older children and children: Children show symptoms of hearing loss, parents should take the child to the hospital for timely examination. Children at high risk of hearing loss or developmental delay should have their hearing tested between 2 and 2.5 years old. Prevention during pregnancy: before and during pregnancy, it is necessary to be fully vaccinated to avoid viral infections in the first 3 months of pregnancy that cause birth defects and deafness.; Newborns: Newborns need a hearing screening before leaving the hospital.

Children at high risk of hearing loss or developmental delays should have their hearing tested from 2 to 2.5 years old.; Prevention during pregnancy: before and during pregnancy, it is necessary to be fully vaccinated to avoid viral infections in the first 3 months of pregnancy that cause birth defects and deafness.\n3. Need to care for and clean ears regularly\nEar cleaning is the best way to limit earwax clogging the ear canal. However, we must know how to properly clean our ears and not arbitrarily poke and remove earwax with sharp objects because it can damage the structure of the ear and even cause a punctured eardrum.\n4. Wear headphones properly\nPupils, students, and office workers should limit wearing headphones that play loud music. When wearing headphones, you should wear them at a moderate level. You should let your ears rest after a period of wearing headphones.\n5. Need ear protection\nWhen living or working in places that are too noisy or loud. We can use noise-canceling earplugs.\n6. Regularly examine and test your hearing\nAccording to research, after the age of 30, hearing will begin to decline, then every 10 years, hearing will decrease by one level. Regular hearing tests are needed to ensure hearing ability, performed for both adults and children.\nSee more hearing testing methods for children at Tam Anh General Hospital.\nTo get a hearing examination, you can go to Tam Anh General Hospital System at the contact address: - Hanoi 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Bo De Ward, Long Bien District, City.

In the long term, if the disease is not treated, people with hearing loss are at risk of depression because they withdraw into themselves and rarely communicate. Particularly for infants and young children, if hearing loss is not detected promptly, it will lead to lifelong defects in language and speech. Therefore, having a hearing test at the hospital is very important.",
