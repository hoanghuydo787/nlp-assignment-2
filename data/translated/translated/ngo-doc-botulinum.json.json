    "content": "Botulinum poisoning: Symptoms, causes and prevention\n\nIn Vietnam, we continuously encounter cases of botulinum poisoning after eating vegetarian pate, pork sausage, fermented fish... Botulinum poisoning is a serious poisoning.\nJust 0.03 mcg injected into a vein is enough to kill a 70kg person\n.\nSo what are the symptoms of botulinum poisoning? What are the causes and how to prevent them?\n\nWhat is Botulinum bacteria?\nBotulinum bacteria (Clostridium Botulinum, abbreviated C.botulinum) is a rod-shaped, anaerobic gram-positive bacteria that can only grow in an oxygen-deficient environment.\nIn 1895, the C.botulinum bacteria was first recognized and isolated by Emile Van Ermengem when he discovered a group of botulism diseases after eating ham.\nClostridium botulinum bacteria produce spores, which are mobile, heat-resistant and exist everywhere in the environment: soil, dust, mud, feces...\n\nWhat is Botulinum toxin?\nBotulinum toxin is a protein produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. This is the most powerful deadly poison ever known, the lethal dose when injected is about 1.2-1.3 ng/kg and 10-13 ng/kg when inhaled. Under hypoxic conditions, C. botulinum bacteria produce spores and then excrete toxins. There are 7 main types of Botulinum toxin,Â  designated: A, B, C, D, E ,F, G; Of which 4 groups A, B, E and F (rare) cause disease in humans. (first)\nC. botulinum bacteria do not grow in acidic conditions (pH less than 4.6), so toxins are not formed in acidic foods. However, even lower pH levels do not decompose any previously formed toxins. Food preservation methods that combine low temperature, salt content and/or appropriate pH will help prevent bacterial growth as well as the formation of toxins.\nBotulinum toxin has been found in many foods, including vegetables stored in low-acid environments such as green beans, vegetables, mushrooms and beets, canned foods, fermented fish, salted fish and smoked meats, and meat products such as ham and sausages.\n\nWhat is botulinum poisoning?\nBotulinum poisoning is a serious illness, with symptoms that may include drooping eyelids and abnormalities involving the muscles of the face, eyes and throat. Bacteria produce toxins (toxins) that attack the nervous system, causing muscle weakness and paralysis. If left untreated, botulinum poisoning can be fatal. (2)\nThe most common types of botulinum poisoning include:\nFood poisoning: occurs when a patient eats food contaminated with Clostridium botulinum spores. When food is stored improperly, bacteria can grow. When bacteria grow, they release toxins into food. Food poisoning often occurs when home-made canned food is due to improper preservation or storage or businesses that do not ensure food safety. Other sources of food poisoning include:\nOil infused with herbs. Potatoes baked in foil. Canned cheese sauce. Bottled garlic. Canned tomatoes. Carrot juice. Food is kept warm or not stored in the refrigerator.; Oil infused with herbs.; Potatoes baked in foil.; Canned cheese sauce.; Bottled garlic.; Canned tomatoes.; Carrot juice.; Food is kept warm or not stored in the refrigerator.; Infant botulism: occurs when babies ingest Clostridium botulinum spores. These spores develop into bacteria, colonize the child's intestines and release disease-causing toxins. Honey contaminated with spores is also the cause of illness in some cases. This is why doctors advise against giving children honey before they are at least 1 year old.\nWound poisoning: rare, when Clostridium botulinum spores enter an open wound, they grow and release toxins into the blood. Wound poisoning can occur in people who inject drugs. In some cases, the toxin develops after surgery or serious injury.\nTreatment-induced poisoning: occurs when a patient is injected with an overdose of botulinum toxin to treat wrinkles and migraines. Beauty treatments - Botox injections to remove wrinkles leading to Botulinum poisoning are very rare. And it's best for women to only get Botox injections when prescribed by dermatologists - cosmetic specialists, at reputable, licensed hospitals/facilities.\nWhen food is stored improperly, bacteria can grow and release toxins into the food.\n\nSymptoms of botulinum poisoning\nSymptoms of botulinum poisoning in infants can range from mild to severe, including:\nDrooping eyelids (ptosis).; Drooling.; Weak cry.; Eat slowly or poorly; Reduced reflexes.; Constipation.; Shortness of breath.\nSymptoms of botulinum poisoning in older children and adults often involve the muscles of the face, eyes, and throat. If left untreated, symptoms will spread to other parts of the body. Signs appear from a few hours to a few days after ingesting botulism spores. Symptoms include:\nDrooping eyelids (ptosis).; Double or blurred vision; Dry mouth (xerostomia).; Stutter.; Difficulty swallowing.; Shortness of breath.; Weakness or paralysis of the arms or legs; Nausea and vomiting.\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nFor botulinum poisoning, symptoms usually begin 12 - 36 hours after eating contaminated food. (3)\nIf the patient has symptoms of poisoning, even if the cause has not been determined, they should see an emergency doctor immediately.\n\nIs botulinum toxin dangerous? symptoms\nBotulinum poisoning can paralyze muscles, especially swallowing and breathing muscles. Although antitoxins are helpful in many cases, some people still die from respiratory problems and infections. In addition, other complications due to botulinum poisoning include:\nExtreme fatigue.; Long-term weakness.; Shortness of breath.; Pneumonia and infection.; Nervous system problems.\nBotulinum poisoning can paralyze muscles, especially swallowing and breathing muscles.\n\nHow to diagnose botulinum poisoning\nTo diagnose botulinum poisoning, the doctor will conduct a test to find toxins in the patient's blood, stool or vomit. Suspected food samples should also be tested for toxins.\nOther tests that need to be performed include:\nCT-Scan/MRI brain.; Cerebrospinal fluid testing.; Test neuromuscular function (electromyography).\nTest results may take several days. Therefore, doctors usually begin treatment immediately if poisoning is suspected.\n\nHow to treat botulinum poisoning?\nDepending on the cause and severity of poisoning, doctors use many different treatment methods. The most effective treatment is antitoxin, which should be administered to the patient as soon as possible after symptoms begin. However, the antidote does not heal what has already been damaged. The patient may need to be treated in the hospital for several weeks or even months.\nPatients with symptoms of severe respiratory failure may need to be mechanically ventilated and monitored in the ICU, until respiratory muscle weakness improves.\nFor patients with poisoned wounds, doctors will perform surgery to remove the poisoned wound. At the same time, the patient will be given antibiotics to treat the infection.\n\nHow to prevent botulinum poisoning:\nFor food poisoning:\nRefrigerate food within 2 hours of cooking. Proper refrigeration will prevent bacteria from creating spores.; Cook food thoroughly; Avoid food containers that show signs of spoilage or swelling. This may be a sign produced by bacteria.; Sterilize home canned foods in a pressure cooker at 250 degrees F (121 degrees C) for 30 minutes.; Throw away preserved foods that have a foul smell.; For poisoning in infants:; Do not give honey to children under 1 year old; Breastfeed to slow the progression of the disease if botulinum poisoning develops.\nFor wound poisoning:\nDo not abuse injectable drugs.; See a doctor to treat the wound when there are signs of infection such as redness, pain, swelling and pus.; Clean wounds contaminated with dirt and soil; For iatrogenic poisoning: Botox injections should only be administered by a licensed physician.\nRefrigerating food properly will prevent bacteria from creating spores that cause botulinum poisoning.\nBotulinum causes death if not treated promptly. Most patients who are diagnosed and treated promptly can recover completely and function normally throughout their lives. Tam Anh General Hospital with its Emergency Department and Intensive Care Department brings together leading experts, experienced and highly specialized doctors, and quick response to emergencies to help the examination, diagnosis and treatment process. Timely treatment for patients.\nBotulinum is a serious disease that attacks the body's nervous system, causing muscle weakness and paralysis. Botulinum poisoning is rare but if left untreated, it can be fatal. Through this article, we hope that patients will understand the symptoms, understand the causes and know how to prevent this dangerous disease.",
