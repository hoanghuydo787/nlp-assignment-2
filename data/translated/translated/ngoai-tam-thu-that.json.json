    "content": "Ventricular extrasystole: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis, prevention\n\nVentricular extrasystole is one of the most common causes of irregular heartbeat. If the patient does not have other cardiovascular diseases, ventricular extrasystole will not lead to serious complications. On the contrary, it is necessary to treat the disease thoroughly to prevent arrhythmia complications.\nThere are many causes of arrhythmia, including ventricular premature beats\n\nWhat is ventricular extrasystole?\nVentricular ectropion is a phenomenon in which the heart beats too early because the ventricles automatically beat, disrupting the heart's normal rhythm. A heart with ventricular extrasystole will have a normal beat, an extra beat, a slight pause, then a stronger than normal beat. The heart must take in more blood during pauses, creating more force for the next beat. This process can occur randomly or repeat with a determined frequency. (first)\n\nSymptoms of ventricular extrasystole\nIn the mild stage, ventricular extrasystoles often show few or no symptoms. As the disease progresses, it can cause abnormal sensations in the chest, palpitations, feeling of missed beats, tightness in the throat, tightness in the chest, skipped beats, dropped beats; accompanied by dizziness, pain and discomfort in the chest...\nIf you experience any of the above symptoms, see a cardiologist for advice, examination, and appropriate diagnostic tests.\n\nCause of ventricular extrasystoles\nPeople of all ages can experience ventricular extrasystoles. In most cases of infrequent ventricular extrasystole, the underlying cause cannot be determined. Meanwhile, with repeated ventricular extrasystoles, the cause is often due to: (2)\nSome medications such as decongestants, antihistamines...; Alcohol or drug abuse; Stimulants such as caffeine, tobacco; Increased adrenaline levels in the body due to strenuous exercise or excessive anxiety; The heart muscle is damaged due to diseases such as congenital heart disease, coronary artery disease, heart failure, cardiomyopathy...; Some endocrine disorders such as hyperthyroidism\nAbuse of alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco increases the risk of ventricular extrasystoles\n\nAre ventricular extrasystoles dangerous?\nVentricular extrasystoles themselves can be a manifestation of serious cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure, coronary artery disease..., which are diseases with a risk of death. On the other hand, too much ventricular extrasystoles over time will reduce heart function leading to heart failure. (3)\n\nDiagnostic method\nTo diagnose ventricular extrasystoles, the doctor will need to ask information about symptoms, medical history, medications the patient is taking, and lifestyle. The examination includes taking a medical history and listening to the heart. After that, the doctor may order a number of additional important laboratory tests to diagnose ventricular extrasystole, including: (4)\nElectrocardiogram (ECG or EKG): This is a paraclinical test that records the electrical activity of the heart, showing whether the heart is beating too fast or too slow. The electrocardiogram recording process usually only lasts a few minutes and does not cause pain or discomfort to the patient.; ECG 24-48 hours: Some patients will be prescribed continuous ECG monitoring at home to increase the ability to detect ventricular extrasystole, especially cases that occur infrequently. The patient will wear a continuous electrocardiogram monitoring device for 24-48 hours or longer. The information will then be compiled and analyzed by doctors to make the most accurate diagnosis.; ECG stress test: You are asked to walk on a rolling mat parallel to the continuous ECG measurement. This test often helps detect certain exercise-related arrhythmias.\nPatients undergo electrocardiographic stress testing when ventricular extrasystole is suspected\n\nMethods of treating ventricular extrasystole\nMost patients with mild ventricular extrasystoles with few symptoms usually do not require treatment. However, patients need to be periodically re-examined to monitor the progression of the disease. On the other hand, patients with multiple ventricular extrasystoles, severe symptoms, or ventricular extrasystoles due to severe heart disease will require treatment. In the case of treating this ventricular extrasystole, the doctor may use some drugs to slow the heart rate or antiarrhythmic drugs. In many cases when the patient does not respond to medication or does not want to take medication, doctors can perform intervention to eliminate the rhythm generator in the ventricles through high-frequency radio waves with a fairly high success rate.\nIn all cases, patients are recommended to change their lifestyle, rest to reduce stress, and stay away from tobacco, alcohol and stimulants.\n\nPrevention of ventricular extrasystoles\nTo prevent ventricular extrasystoles and improve heart health, you should:\nKeep a diary: If you frequently experience ventricular extrasystole, keep a daily diary of when your symptoms appear. This helps identify foods, drinks or activities that are precipitating factors that cause ventricular extrasystoles, thereby effectively preventing them.; Limit the use of stimulants: Caffeine, alcohol, tobacco and stimulants make ventricular extrasystoles occur more often. Therefore, limiting or avoiding the use of these substances will contribute to reducing symptoms of ventricular extrasystoles.; Control stress: Frequent anxiety and stress can trigger irregular heartbeat. Therefore, you need to learn how to balance your emotions and eliminate stress from your life.\nArrhythmia and Cardiac Electrophysiology Department, Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital diagnoses and treats heart rhythm disorders such as atrial fibrillation, tachyarrhythmia, bradyarrhythmia, sinus node failure , ventricular premature beats... using modern techniques such as catheter ablation; Placement of pacemakers (1 chamber, 2 chambers), implantable defibrillators (ICD), cardiac resynchronization machines (CRT-P; CRT-D)... The center brings together a team of experienced and certified doctors and nurses. Equipped with advanced machinery systems, helping to accurately diagnose and support doctors in choosing appropriate treatment methods for each patient.\nVentricular extrasystole, if it exists alone, is not a life-threatening disease. But when another cardiovascular disease is present, it can cause serious complications if not well controlled. It is important to determine the cause of ventricular extrasystoles, so that effective treatment and prevention measures can be taken.",
