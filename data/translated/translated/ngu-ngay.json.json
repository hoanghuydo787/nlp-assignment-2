    "content": "Snoring: Causes, signs and prevention\n\nSnoring is a fairly common condition, occurring in about 57% of men and 40% of women. Snoring can be harmless, but it can also be an underlying medical condition that needs treatment. Snoring is a sound made during sleep due to the vibration of different parts of the upper respiratory tract. Snoring is one of the main symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea. Snoring can also be linked to underlying cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, etc., so this condition needs attention. Early examination and treatment can be helpful in preventing complications caused by snoring.\nSnoring is a condition in which you unconsciously make noise while sleeping.\n\nWhat disease is snoring?\nSnoring is a condition in which you unconsciously make noise while sleeping.\nSnoring is a hoarse sound made in the throat during sleep. Sounds range from very soft, barely audible noises to extremely annoying noises that can be loud enough to affect the next room.\nSnoring often causes discomfort for people sharing the same bed or room. Sometimes, snoring even causes discord with them.\n\nCauses of snoring\nAccording to MSc.BSc.CKI Nguyen Thi Huong - Doctor of Ear, Nose and Throat Department, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, the cause of snoring can be explained as follows:\nPathogenesis of snoring\nWhat is the reason for snoring? Snoring is the result of vibration of the soft tissues of the nasopharynx caused by airflow, especially the soft palate. As in any other structure, vibration in the nasopharynx develops depending on interacting factors, including mass, muscle strength and associated neck structures as well as the velocity and direction of air flow.\nThe fact that a person does not snore while awake suggests that sleep-induced muscle relaxation may be part of the cause of snoring. Because muscle tone is the only component of vibration that can change during sleep, while tissue volume and associated structures do not change.\nWhen muscle tone is reduced, the airways cannot be kept open in response to the negative pressure in the lung caused by inhalation, and the upper airway narrows. This will increase local airflow velocity (for a given inhaled volume), thereby promoting wheezing and snoring.\nSnoring is more likely to occur in airways that have been damaged by structures, including:\nSmall chin, receding chin;; Deviated nasal septum;; Fat;; Big tongue;; Nasopharyngeal tumor.\n\nCauses of snoring while sleeping\n1. Due to primary snoring\nPrimary snoring is snoring that is not accompanied by awakening or excessive arousal, but causes airflow restriction, oxygen desaturation, or arrhythmia during sleep. It even occurs in people who are not sleepy during the day.\n2. Due to breathing disorders during sleep\nSnoring is often a symptom of sleep-disordered breathing, which ranges from obstructive upper airway syndrome to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Each type has similar upper airway obstruction pathophysiology but differs in the severity and consequences of airway obstruction. The consequences are mainly related to sleep disorders.\nPatients with obstructive sleep apnea have ≥5 episodes of apnea or hypopnea (with each episode lasting at least 10 seconds) per hour during sleep.\nApnea/hypopnea index [AHI]) accompanied by ≥1 of the following signs:\nDaytime sleepiness, unintentional sleepiness, restless sleep, fatigue or insomnia;; Waking up holding your breath, gasping for breath, or choking;; Bedmates often complain of loud snoring, interrupted breathing, or both while the patient sleeps.\nSleep apnea can be classified by severity:\nMild: 5 to 15 episodes/hour;; Average: 16 to 30 waves/hour;; Severe: >30 episodes/hour.\nObstructive upper airway syndrome may cause daytime sleepiness or other manifestations suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea. But with some episodes of apnea/hypopnea or oxygen desaturation and therefore does not fully meet the criteria for obstructive sleep apnea.\nAlthough snoring itself is not harmful to your health, obstructive sleep apnea can have consequences, such as high blood pressure, stroke, arrhythmia, kidney failure.\n3. Risk factors for snoring\nOld;; Fat;; Use of alcohol or other sedatives;; Chronic nasal congestion or congestion;; Small or receding jaw;; Male;; Premenopausal women;; Pregnancy;; Abnormal structures can block airflow. For example, large tonsils, deviated nasal septum, nasal polyps, enlarged tongue, enlarged soft palate, lateral pharyngeal stenosis;; Snoring can also be caused by family factors such as genetics or sleeping habits.\nObesity is one of the common causes of snoring\n\nSigns of snoring\nWhat are the signs of snoring? People who snore will make vibrating, rattling, and noisy sounds when breathing.\nMSc.BSc.CKI Nguyen Thi Huong said that in patients with sleep apnea, there may be other symptoms of snoring such as:\nOften stop breathing, startle awake when sleeping; (1); Drowsiness during the day;; Morning headache;; Weight gain;; Waking up in the morning tired and sluggish;; Waking up in the middle of the night;; Don't concentrate during the day.\n\nMethods for diagnosing snoring\nAccording to Nguyen Thi Huong, MSc.BSc.CKI, your doctor may perform some tests or perform a sleep study to diagnose the severity of snoring, especially if the doctor suspects sleep apnea. Sleep. An Ear, Nose and Throat specialist can examine the patient's nose, throat and neck to diagnose the cause of snoring.\nTo find out if your snoring may be caused by a health problem, your doctor may ask questions about:\nSnoring volume and frequency;; Sleeping positions that make snoring worse;; Problems caused by impaired sleep, including feeling sleepy during the day or difficulty remembering or concentrating;; Any signs of apnea during sleep.\n\nHow to cure snoring?\nMSc.BSc.CKI Nguyen Thi Huong said, to treat snoring includes general measures to manage risk factors plus physical methods to expand the airway and/or immobilize structures. relate to.\n1. General measures\nSome general measures can be used to treat primary snoring. Their effectiveness has not been well evaluated, mainly because the perception of snoring is very subjective; however, some specific patients may benefit.(2)\nMeasures include:\nAvoid alcohol and sedatives in the hours before bed;; Keep your head high when sleeping, it is best to use a bed or body positioning devices such as a mattress or sleep in a side lying position;; Lose weight, avoid obesity;; Treat nasal congestion with decongestants and/or corticosteroid sprays.\n2. Wear an anti-snoring device\nThese devices should be fitted by specially trained dentists.\nSide effects include temporomandibular joint (TMJ) discomfort, misaligned teeth, and excessive salivation, but most patients respond well to treatment.\n2.1 Mandibular traction devices\nThis is the device most commonly used by snoring patients. It helps move the lower jaw and tongue forward relative to the upper jaw and thus increases the airway diameter during sleep. These devices can be adjusted incrementally after the initial installation to optimize results.\n2.2 Tongue retainer\nThis device uses suction to maintain the tongue in an anterior position.\nA recently developed detachable tongue muscle stimulator can be used during the day. This device helps improve tongue muscle function in patients with snoring or OSA.\n2.3 CPAP devices\nCPAP devices maintain constant positive pressure in the upper airways through a small mask applied over the nose or nose and mouth. By increasing the size of the upper airway, CPAP prevents narrowing or collapse of the upper airway during sleep. Therefore, this device is very effective for OSA and effective for primary snoring.\n3. Surgery\nBecause decreased nasal ventilation promotes snoring, surgery can help correct specific causes of airway narrowing. They can be nasal polyps, tonsil hypertrophy, deviated septum...\nVarious pharyngeal surgeries that alter the structure of the palate and sometimes the uvula have been developed to treat obstructive sleep apnea. Some are also helpful for non-apnea snoring.\n3.1 Pharyngeal plastic surgery\nThis is a procedure under general anesthesia that involves reconstructing the uvula, nasopharynx, and pharyngeal wall to increase the size of the airway. Pharyngoplasty can be effective for snoring, but its effects are likely to be short-term, lasting a few years.\n3.2 Coblator and laser assisted surgery (LAUP)\nThis surgery is laser-assisted and less invasive than pharyngoplasty. It works to reduce the size of the uvula and soft palate to widen the airways.\n3.3 Plastic surgery with injections\nFor injection plastic surgery to treat scleroderma, medication is injected into the submucosa of the soft palate to reinforce and the uvula to reduce the size of the fatty tissue of the posterior pharyngeal wall and base of the tongue.\n3.4 Surgery to strengthen the palate\nA probe is used to apply heat energy to the soft palate and cauterize it. This method helps strengthen the soft palate to prevent it from narrowing the airway.\n\nMethods to prevent snoring\nChanging habits, activities and lifestyle can help prevent snoring.\nControl weight, avoid obesity;; Do not drink alcohol or smoke;; Avoid tension, stress, staying up late;; Thorough treatment of nose and sinus diseases, mouth and throat diseases, and respiratory diseases.\n\nFrequently asked questions about snoring\n1. Is snoring dangerous? What are the signs of snoring?\nAccording to MSc.BS.CKI Nguyen Thi Huong, whether snoring is dangerous or not, whether snoring is a disease depends on its type, severity and frequency.\nMild snoring: Occasional snoring that usually does not require medical treatment. Its main impact is on bedmates or roommates who may be disturbed by occasional noise.; Mild snoring: Occasional snoring that usually does not require medical treatment. Its main impact is on bedmates or roommates, who may be disturbed by occasional noise.\nPrimary snoring: Primary snoring occurs more than three nights per week. Because of its frequency, it can cause more discomfort to the person sharing the bed. However, it is not usually considered a health concern unless there are signs of sleep disruption or sleep apnea. In that case, the patient may need to have some laboratory tests done to diagnose the cause.; Primary snoring: Primary snoring occurs more than three nights per week.

In that case, the patient may need to have some laboratory tests done to diagnose the cause.\nSnoring related to obstructive sleep apnea: Snoring related to OSA is more worrisome from a health perspective. If OSA is left untreated, it can greatly impact a person's sleep and overall health. Uncontrolled OSA is linked to dangerous daytime sleepiness and serious health conditions including cardiovascular problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, and depression.; Snoring related to obstructive sleep apnea: Snoring related to OSA is more worrisome from a health perspective. If OSA is left untreated, it can greatly impact a person's sleep and overall health. Uncontrolled OSA is linked to dangerous daytime sleepiness and serious health conditions including cardiovascular problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, and depression.\n2. Is snoring contagious? Is snoring genetic?\nSnoring is not a contagious disease but can be hereditary. For example, if your family has a history of obesity, you are also at risk. Obesity is one of the causes of snoring.\n3. How to reduce noise when snoring\nIn addition to using a number of devices to help reduce snoring, snorers can sleep separately in a soundproof room to reduce the impact of snoring on others.\n4. When is it necessary to treat snoring?\nIf snoring is a symptom of sleep apnea, the patient needs to be treated early to avoid dangerous complications.\nMSc.BSc.CKI Nguyen Thi Huong recommends that patients should go to the hospital when:\nSnoring occurs three or more times per week;; Snoring is very loud or uncomfortable;; Snoring accompanied by gasping, choking or snorting sounds;; Obesity or recent weight gain;; Daytime sleepiness;; Lack of concentration;; Morning headache;; High Blood Pressure;; Teeth grinding at night;; Frequent urination at night.\nPatients should go to the hospital for examination when snoring occurs more than 3 times a week\n5. What should you eat and drink to reduce snoring?\nPeople who snore need to limit eating too much dinner and not eating before bedtime to help improve snoring.\nSnoring can be benign, but it can also pose many health risks if it stems from sleep apnea. If snoring is frequent and lasts for more than a few months and does not improve, the patient needs to go to the hospital for examination, find the cause and get early treatment to avoid complications that negatively affect health.",
