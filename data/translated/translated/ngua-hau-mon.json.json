    "content": "What disease is anal itching? Causes, symptoms and prevention\n\nAnal itching is a common unpleasant symptom, stemming from many different causes. In most cases, effectiveness can be improved by taking medication and changing daily lifestyle. However, to minimize some unwanted medical problems, as soon as patients notice any unusual signs, they should immediately contact their doctor to find effective solutions.\n\nWhat disease is anal itching?\nAnal itching is a condition in which the skin in or around the anus becomes irritated, leading to uncomfortable itching. In most cases, it is usually a sign that this area is infected. The intensity of itching and the degree of inflammation tend to increase when the anus is directly damaged by scratching or exposure to moisture. In case the itching progresses intensely and appears with symptoms of pain and burning, the patient may not be able to bear it.(1)\nAnal itching is divided into two main types, including:\nPrimary anal itching: This type is often the most common, with no clear cause.; Secondary anal itching: This type comes from many different causes such as infection, contact dermatitis...\n\nCauses of anal itching\nAnal itching occurs due to many different reasons, typically including: (2)\n1. Pinworm infection\nPinworms are parasites with a small body size, white or light gray color, and grow and reproduce based on nutrients taken from the host. The main habitat is the patient's intestines and rectum, laying eggs around the anus at night, causing itching. Pinworms enter the digestive tract through dirty food or unsanitary utensils. This condition occurs most commonly in children.\n2. Due to anal fistula\nAnal fistulas are tears in the mucosa or anal canal, causing fluid to flow out, irritating the skin, leading to pain and itching. The leading cause of this condition is trauma, including: constipation, diarrhea for long periods of time, anal sex... In addition, cancer, Crohn's disease... are also factors may increase the risk of anal fistula.\n3. Due to hemorrhoids\nHemorrhoids are swollen veins that form outside or inside the anus and rectum, causing a burning and itching sensation. External hemorrhoids (large hemorrhoids outside the anus) can make cleaning after bowel movements difficult. Internal hemorrhoids (hemorrhoids inside the rectum) can even lead to bleeding, fecal incontinence or incontinence. All of these cases irritate the skin, causing the anus to itch.\n4. Due to allergy to medicine\nAntibiotics are often used to treat infections, but in many cases they can kill beneficial bacteria in the intestines. At this time, the natural balance is lost, leading to diarrhea. In some cases, yeast infections also occur due to the use of antibiotics. From there, the skin in the anus is easily irritated, leading to uncomfortable itching and burning.\n5. Due to Candida fungal infection\nCandida fungi often live in the digestive tract, accumulate in the intestines and then move to the anal canal causing yeast infections. This type of parasite grows and develops in a humid environment, some favorable conditions include:\nThe weather is hot and humid; Wear tight clothes; Hygiene is not guaranteed; Sweating too much.\nPeople susceptible to Candida infection include:\nPregnant women.; People who are overweight or obese; The patient is taking antibiotics; People with weakened immune systems due to diabetes or taking immunosuppressant drugs.; Pregnant .\n6. Due to sexual diseases\nSome sexually transmitted diseases can also cause anal itching, such as herpes, warts, gonorrhea... Among them, warts are the most common factor, caused by the HPV virus. This is a sexually transmitted disease that develops in and around the anus and can then spread to the genitals. If this condition is not treated early, there is a risk of more acne appearing, and in the long term it can easily lead to anal cancer.\n7. Hygiene habits\nThe habit of not cleaning thoroughly after defecation can cause anal itching due to remaining waste. Therefore, it is better to use wet, odorless, gentle paper to wipe first, then clean again with dry, soft paper. In addition, some bad habits such as using hot water, soap, scented spray, wiping too hard... can also make itching worse. The reason is that anal skin is very sensitive, the protective barrier is easily destroyed, leading to irritation.\n8. Eating habits\nSoft drinks can cause the anal muscles to loosen, causing stool to leak out, causing itching. In addition, some other foods and drinks also cause similar irritation, including:\nCoffee.; Tea.; Chocolate.; Spicy food.; Citrus fruits.; Tomato.; Butter, milk.\n9. Psoriasis\nPsoriasis often appears in areas of the skin that are not exposed to the sun. This can also be the cause of anal itching, redness but no scabs. The itching is often very intense, accompanied by a burning pain during defecation. Similarly, eczema is also a common cause, and increased sebum secretion can also be a factor causing itching in the anus.\n10. Other causes\nAnal sphincter laxity â€“ frequent fecal leakage causes anal itching.; Diabetes.; Early stage leukemia; Warts.; Women in menopause.; Using unsafe underwear can cause anal irritation; Medical problems: type 2 diabetes, leukemia, lymphoma, kidney failure, liver disease, hyperthyroidism, anemia...; Psychological anxiety and stress.(5)\n\nRecognize the symptoms of anal itching\nItching in the anus is easy to recognize by some typical symptoms as follows:(4)\nItching in anal area; Anal pain; Burning in anal area; Scratches appear on the anus; The skin around the anus is abnormally thickened; Anal itching occurs during defecation; Anal itching with genital itching; In some cases, anal itching is accompanied by blood.\n\nHow to diagnose anal itching?\nTo diagnose anal itching, your doctor will conduct a number of tests to determine the exact cause.
