    "content": "Thyroid disease: Signs, causes, diagnosis and treatment\n\nHyperplastic thyroid follicular cells form thyroid nodules. Most thyroid nodules are benign (90%), only a small percentage of thyroid nodules are malignant.\n\nWhat is the thyroid gland?\nDr. Phan Thi Thuy Dung, Department of Endocrinology, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, said: The thyroid gland is butterfly-shaped, consisting of 2 lobes connected by the thyroid isthmus, located in the middle and front of the neck. This is an important endocrine gland, with the function of producing thyroid hormones, helping the body use energy, keep warm, and help the brain, heart and many organs function normally. In addition, the thyroid gland also secretes the hormone calcitonin to help regulate calcium levels in the blood.\n\nWhy do you get thyroid nodules?\nNodules appear in the thyroid gland at any age, mainly in women. By age 60, half of the population has thyroid nodules, luckily 90% of thyroid nodules are benign and do not turn into cancer, only 5% - 10% of thyroid nodules are malignant.\nIn most cases of thyroid nodules, the cause is unknown; iodine deficiency has been identified as a causative factor. The frequency of thyroid nodules that can be felt when examined by hand is about 5% in women and 1% in men, mainly in patients living in iodine-deficient areas, but in reality most thyroid nodules are small. cannot be touched. Therefore, during a normal examination, thyroid nodules may be missed. However, with the development of ultrasound, the frequency of detecting thyroid nodules can now be up to 19% - 68%.\nMany opinions believe that the thyroid gland has nodules due to the anatomical structure of the female body going through many milestones of hormonal changes: puberty, menstruation, pregnancy and childbirth, breastfeeding and menopause.\n\nHow dangerous are thyroid nodules?\nThe thyroid nodule can be a thyroid cyst - a benign thyroid nodule, or a malignant thyroid nodule. Most thyroid nodules do not change thyroid function. However, some thyroid nodules can increase activity, produce an excess amount of thyroid hormone, causing hyperthyroidism with symptoms of weight loss, palpitations, tremors, muscle weakness, etc. Blood in the thyroid cyst will cause pain in the neck, jaw, and ears.\nA thyroid nodule that is large enough will cause compression of the airway or esophagus, which can cause difficulty breathing, swallowing, or throat irritation and coughing. In a few cases, thyroid nodules compress the laryngeal nerve, causing hoarseness, but it is often related to thyroid cancer.\n\nSigns of people with thyroid nodules\nAccording to Dr. Phan Thi Thuy Dung, most people with thyroid nodules have no symptoms. The disease is accidentally discovered during a general health check or other unrelated diseases through imaging such as CT or ultrasound. neck area or abnormal thyroid function tests.\nIn a few cases, when the goiter is large, there will be symptoms of compression such as difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, coughing, hoarseness or pain when there is bleeding in the thyroid follicle, etc.\nSome patients discover it because when they look in the mirror, they see a large mass in their neck area or when they button their shirt and it feels cramped.\n\nHow to detect thyroid patients\nThe best way to detect thyroid nodules is a neck examination that includes palpation of the thyroid gland and thyroid ultrasound, which helps detect non-palpable thyroid nodules. Doctor Phan Thi Thuy Dung shared that patients are also tested for thyroid hormone (Thyroxine, or T4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in the blood to determine whether the thyroid gland is functioning normally or not.\nIn some cases where it is not possible to determine whether a thyroid nodule is cancerous (very low rate of malignancy) by clinical examination and blood tests, special tests such as ultrasound and needle aspiration of thyroid cells are needed. small.\nWith ultrasound, the patient has an ultrasound of the thyroid gland with high-frequency sound waves to help evaluate thyroid nodules. The doctor will see if the thyroid gland has one or more nodules, whether the overall size has increased or not, and determine the size of the nodule. Ultrasound results can also identify solid or cystic nodules and characteristics that suggest whether the thyroid nodule is malignant or benign. If the thyroid nodules are benign, the doctor usually does not need to remove them, just monitor them over time, unless they cause symptoms of choking or difficulty swallowing. Ultrasound for follow-up monitoring is very important.\nOnce the initial evaluation is completed, thyroid ultrasound can be used to monitor thyroid nodules non-surgically to determine how the nodule develops over time and to monitor the risk of progression to cancer. letter from the thyroid person.\nUltrasound also helps to accurately direct the needle directly into the nucleus when aspirating thyroid cells with a small needle for thyroid nodules with suspicious malignant characteristics on thyroid ultrasound.\nFine needle aspiration (FNA) of the thyroid gland is a procedure that helps to initially assess the cellular nature of the thyroid nodule as to whether it is benign or malignant. The doctor will use a very small needle, under ultrasound guidance, to enter the correct location of the thyroid nodule and suck out cells from the thyroid nodule. Then, the smear sample is examined under a microscope so the pathologist can find cancer cells. Malignant thyroid nodules account for about 5%-10%, usually due to papillary cancer, which is the most common type of thyroid cancer. If cancer is detected, the entire thyroid gland will be removed by an experienced doctor.\n\nTreatment of thyroid nodules\nWith thyroid nodules â€“ benign thyroid cysts are often monitored without surgery. However, patients are monitored by ultrasound, initially from 12 to 24 months, then gradually increasing over time from 2 to 5 years. But if the thyroid nodule has the following abnormalities, it must be thoroughly examined and evaluated, including: significant growth such as a change in volume of more than 50% or a 20% increase in diameter with a minimal increase in two or more dimension of at least 2 mm, or abnormal signs appear on ultrasound, symptoms of invasive compression in the neck area, suspected cervical lymph nodes, etc.\nIn malignant cases, including papillary cancer, medullary thyroid cancer, thyroid lymphoma, anaplastic cancer and metastatic cancer to the thyroid gland. Patients with a cytological diagnosis of malignancy should undergo surgery.\nIn addition, depending on each specific case, doctors will have different treatment regimens for thyroid patients.\n\nSubjects who need to be screened for thyroid cancer (malignant thyroid nodules):\nFinally, the following subjects need to have their thyroid examined to detect cases of malignant thyroid nodules (thyroid cancer) early, including: young people <14 years old or elderly people >70 years old to detect thyroid nodules and thyroid nodules. Rapid growth in size, symptoms of hoarseness, history of radiotherapy to the head, face and neck area or family history of thyroid cancer.\nMost cases of thyroid cancer are curable and rarely cause life-threatening problems if detected early and treated promptly.",
