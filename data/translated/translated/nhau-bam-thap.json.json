    "content": "Low placenta: Causes, signs, treatment and prevention\n\nLow placenta is an abnormal phenomenon in the position of the placenta. Many pregnant mothers, when diagnosed with low placenta, will feel worried and insecure. So what is low placenta, and does this condition affect pregnancy? This article has the professional advice of Dr. Duong Ngoc Hung, Obstetrics and Gynecology Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi.\n\nWhat is low placenta?\nLow placenta or low placenta is a condition in which the placenta is not located at the bottom of the uterus, but part of the placenta is attached to the lower part of the uterus, close to the cervix. The nature of this condition is a type of placenta previa that is divided into 4 types based on anatomy as follows: (1)\nLow-lying placenta: is the placenta spreading to the lower part of the uterus but not reaching the internal os of the cervix; Placental attachment: is the edge of the placenta close to the edge of the internal os of the cervix; Incomplete central placenta previa: The placenta partially covers the internal cervical os; Complete central placenta previa: The placenta covers the entire internal cervical os.\nThe placenta plays an important role in providing the necessary nutrients for the fetus to develop. Normally the placenta is attached to the front, back or bottom of the uterus. However, in some cases, the placenta is located low near the internal opening of the cervix. On ultrasound, this distance is given as less than 2cm from the edge of the placenta to the internal os of the cervix, this is also the standard for diagnosing placenta previa on ultrasound.\nAccording to Dr. Duong Ngoc Hung, when the fetus is still young, the low-lying placenta can go away on its own as the fetus gradually grows and the mother's uterus grows toward the bottom, the placenta can be pushed higher. Therefore, low-lying placenta in particular or placenta previa in general is diagnosed when the gestational age is 28 weeks onwards.\n\nLow-lying placentas are common\nBecause of the low position of the placenta near the cervix, in the last months of pregnancy, the formation of the lower uterine segment leads to easy vaginal bleeding. Therefore, when a doctor diagnoses low placenta, pregnant women should closely monitor and have regular prenatal examinations as prescribed by the doctor, especially in the last months, vaginal bleeding blisters often occur at this time.\nReference: Common and dangerous placental diseases\n\nCause of low vegetable adhesion\nCurrently, the cause of low placenta in pregnancy has not been clearly determined. However, according to experts, there are a number of factors that can contribute to increasing the risk of disease including: (2)\nWomen with a history of cesarean section or scars on the uterine wall such as uterine fibroid treatment, uterine surgery, etc.; Women pregnant with multiples or with a history of miscarriage or abortion;; Women who have given birth multiple times;; Pregnancy over the age of 35;; Pregnant women have uterine infections;; Women who have had a low-lying placenta in a previous pregnancy;; Women have the habit of smoking and using a lot of caffeine;; An inadequate diet can lead to poor nutritional circulation, so the placenta needs to expand its attachment area to compensate for nutritional deficiencies;\n\nSymptoms of low placenta are common\nSymptoms of low placenta are often easy to detect in the last 3 months of pregnancy. During this period, pregnant women may have sudden and unexplained bleeding without abdominal pain. The blood is bright red and clots after coming out. Besides, pregnant women easily bleed during exercise, intercourse and heavy work.\nIn addition, signs of sharp pain, uterine contractions, and vaginal bleeding can also warn of other pregnancy problems. Therefore, when pregnant mothers encounter the above conditions, they should visit reputable obstetric facilities. The doctor will check with ultrasound and monitor to detect abnormalities that may occur from the condition. There are safe treatment measures to minimize the risk to the mother and the baby in the womb.\n\nIs low-lying placenta dangerous?\nLow placenta can cause pregnant mothers and fetuses to face dangerous complications that can affect their lives, especially bleeding during pregnancy and labor. (3)\nFor pregnant mothers\nPregnant women with low-lying placenta will face the risk of bleeding many times throughout pregnancy. This condition, if prolonged, will lead to anemia and premature birth in pregnant women. Because the lower part of the uterus lacks a sphincter, postpartum hemorrhage often occurs, and the mother goes into shock due to heavy blood loss, which is life-threatening.\nIn case the placenta is attached close to the cervix, after giving birth the placenta is dissected, leaving the exposed cervix vulnerable to harmful bacteria entering and causing infection. In cases where the placenta is firmly embedded in the uterine muscle and cannot separate from the lining, a hysterectomy may be indicated.\nWith the fetus\nBecause the placenta is low, it causes blood loss in the pregnant mother, so the fetus can suffer from malnutrition and fetal distress. In some cases, pregnant mothers lose too much blood, forcing an early cesarean section to ensure the mother's safety. Therefore, in cases where pregnant mothers have a low-lying placenta, there is often a risk of premature birth, and premature babies may have may face the risk of respiratory failure and poor health.\nIn addition, many opinions suggest that low placement of the placenta is one of the causes of unfavorable fetal position. It is difficult for the fetus to turn its head to the favorable position, which often leads to difficult birth.\n\nCan you have sex if you have a low-lying placenta?\nMany pregnant mothers wonder if they can have sex if they have a low placenta. According to experts, pregnant mothers need to abstain from sex during pregnancy with this condition to avoid causing damage to the cervix during pregnancy. Pregnant mothers with the disease are at risk of heavy bleeding, and sexual intercourse can make this condition worse.\nPregnant mothers should also limit walking, vigorous or excessive exercise to avoid vaginal bleeding. At night, you should put your feet up high to avoid stress and anxiety and maintain an optimistic and happy spirit.\n\nMethod for diagnosing low-lying placenta\nCurrently, to diagnose low placenta during pregnancy, doctors will perform an ultrasound to check. Usually warning signs of this condition often appear during fetal ultrasound from 20 weeks of age. About 10% of cases will develop into complete placenta previa.\nTo diagnose low placenta, the obstetrician will perform one of the following three methods:\nVaginal ultrasound;; Abdominal ultrasound;; Magnetic resonance imaging;\n\nHow to treat low placenta\nWhen diagnosed with low placenta, pregnant mothers need to coordinate and follow the doctor's instructions. Depending on the level of bleeding and the development of the fetus, the doctor will have appropriate treatment methods. (4)\n1. In case of no bleeding or small amount of blood\nFor women with a low-lying placenta but little or no vaginal bleeding, the doctor will recommend that the mother rest at home, limit movement, and only stand and sit when necessary. Besides, avoid vigorous physical activities, abstain from sex, and monitor bleeding regularly. If there is heavy bleeding, go to a medical facility immediately for examination. During labor, if there is no bleeding or little bleeding, vaginal birth can be followed. When the cervix is ​​open, amniocentesis can be done early to limit bleeding.\n2. In case of severe bleeding\nIf pregnant mothers have heavy bleeding, they will be asked to be hospitalized for monitoring. Depending on the amount of blood lost, the doctor will prescribe a blood transfusion or additional medication to prevent premature labor.\nFor a 36-week-old fetus and a mother with heavy bleeding, the doctor will prescribe an early termination of pregnancy and a cesarean section to ensure the safety of mother and baby. In some cases of premature birth, the baby may have to have an embryo maturation injection.\n3. Uncontrolled bleeding\nIn this case, the doctor will prescribe termination of pregnancy and emergency surgery.\n\nHow to prevent low-hanging vegetables\nCurrently, to prevent low placenta, husbands and wives should practice good family planning, limit having many children, and not have multiple abortions.; Pregnant mothers need to comply and remember periodic prenatal check-ups to monitor, detect and promptly handle developments during pregnancy.; Understand the real signs of labor to get to the hospital promptly to avoid affecting the health of mother and fetus.; Distinguishing amniotic leakage from vaginal discharge to avoid the risk of premature birth, fetal distress and stillbirth.; When experiencing vaginal bleeding, you should immediately go to a medical facility with obstetrics expertise for timely examination.; Balance nutrition, provide a scientific diet, suitable for pregnant mothers, eat nutritious foods, choose easy-to-digest foods, fruits and vegetables rich in fiber and vitamins. Besides, pregnant mothers can supplement iron and calcium according to the doctor's instructions.; Take reasonable time to rest, avoid excessive stress and fatigue, which affects the health of the mother and the baby in the womb.\nWith the desire to bring the best health care service to both pregnant women and fetuses throughout pregnancy, from pregnancy to successful \"delivery\", Tam Anh General Hospital deploys full-service maternity services. with outstanding premium quality.
