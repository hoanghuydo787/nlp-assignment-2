    "content": "Placental abruption: Causes, signs, diagnosis, treatment\n\nPlacental abruption is one of the dangerous obstetric complications, commonly occurring in pregnant women in the last 3 months of pregnancy. This accident often occurs suddenly, progresses rapidly, and if not treated promptly, can threaten the life of both the pregnant woman and the fetus.\n\nWhat is placental abruption?\nPlacental Abruption is a dangerous obstetric complication that occurs when the placenta is attached to the right position but detaches prematurely before the fetus is ready to come out. Statistics show that this condition affects about 1% of pregnant women. This obstetric complication can occur at any time after 20 weeks of pregnancy, but is most common in the last 3 months of pregnancy (third trimester). (first)\nThe placenta is an important part, helping to connect and receive nutrients from mother to fetus. Normally, when the fetus is born, the placenta detaches to ensure continuous nourishment of the fetus. However, placental abruption causes the placenta to separate prematurely before the fetus is ready to be born, meaning the blood flow that nourishes the fetus has been cut off.\nDoctor Hoang Ngoc Anh, Doctor at the Center for Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, said that in placental abruption, the placenta can be partially or completely detached. When the placenta is separated from the uterine wall, there is no way to bring the placenta back, which can reduce the amount of oxygen and nutrition that nourishes the fetus, causing heavy bleeding in pregnant women. Therefore, this is a serious obstetric complication that requires immediate medical intervention.\n\nPlacental abruption\nPlacental abruption is most common in the third trimester of pregnancy, especially in the few weeks before giving birth. Depending on the degree of placental abruption (complete or partial) and clinical symptoms, this disease is divided into 4 different types, including: (2)\n1. Hidden placental abruption\nThe pregnant woman had no abnormalities before giving birth and the fetus was born healthy. Placental abruption was detected after birth when a small hematoma appeared after the placenta was removed.\n2. Mild placental abruption\nNo or little blood from the vagina;; Pregnant women may have abdominal pain and a hard stomach. However, the pregnant woman was not shocked, the fetal heart was normal, and the health of both the mother and fetus were stable.\n3. Moderate placental abruption\nNo or moderate vaginal bleeding;; Pregnant women have mild dizziness, low blood pressure, rapid pulse, and examination shows a tense uterus;; Fetal heart rate is unstable.\n4. Severe placental abruption\nNo or heavy vaginal bleeding;; The pregnant woman has obvious signs of dizziness, constant abdominal pain, and on examination the uterus is as stiff as wood;; Fetal failure.\n\nCauses of placental abruption\nDoctor Ngoc Anh said that currently the exact cause of placental abruption is unknown. However, hemorrhage in the decidua basalis leads to the formation of a hematoma in the peritoneum, which is the beginning of the decidua. (3)\nUnder a certain impact, the structure in the decidua is broken and causes bleeding due to disruption of the spiral arterioles of the peritoneum. As the area of ​​hemorrhage gradually increases, a hematoma will form in the decidua, separating the chorion from the uterine muscle layer. The growing hematoma will cause widespread dissection and compression of adjacent placental tissues, resulting in partial or complete detachment of the placenta.\nAny impact on the abdomen during pregnancy such as accidents, falls... can be the onset of placental abruption.\nSome cases that cause placental abruption include:\nPre-eclampsia: Pregnant women with pre-eclampsia have a higher risk of placental abruption; Injuries in the abdominal area: The abdominal area is where the fetus develops, surrounded and protected by many layers such as the uterine wall, abdominal wall, amniotic fluid... Injuries to the abdominal area such as traffic accidents, injuries, etc. Falling... can cause great force causing the placenta to be affected and detach.; Invasive intervention procedures: Medical experts recommend minimizing invasive procedures during pregnancy, such as amniocentesis, umbilical cord blood collection, cesarean section... because they can be unintentional. Adverse effects on the uterus, causing bleeding and formation of blood clots, causing the placenta to separate from the uterine wall.\nIn addition, pregnant women with the following factors will be at increased risk of placental abruption, including:\nHistory of placental abruption in previous pregnancies: Statistics show that if a pregnant woman has had the disease before, the risk of experiencing this obstetric complication again is about 10%.; Smoking: A study showed that pregnant women who had the habit of smoking before pregnancy increased their risk of disease during pregnancy by 40%.; Use of cocaine and stimulants: Placental abruption can occur early in about 10% of pregnant women who use cocaine or stimulants in the last 3 months of pregnancy.; High blood pressure during pregnancy, gestational diabetes, HELLP syndrome: If a pregnant woman has these conditions before pregnancy, notify her obstetrician for close pregnancy monitoring.; Pregnancy at an older age: The risk of placental abruption is higher when the pregnant woman is 35 years of age or older. Most cases of placental abruption occur in pregnant women over 40 years old; Twin or multiple pregnancy: The placenta containing more than one fetus can cause the placenta to separate from the uterine wall prematurely before the fetus is ready to be born.\n\nSymptoms of placental abruption\nDr. Ngoc Anh said that each pregnant woman may have different symptoms of placental abruption, but the most common symptoms are vaginal bleeding or uterine stiffness (excessive hypertonicity). Vaginal bleeding can vary and is not a sign of how much of the placenta has separated from the uterine wall. In some cases, pregnant women do not see blood in the vagina because the blood is trapped between the placenta and the uterine wall.\nVaginal bleeding is the most common and common symptom\nSome other symptoms and signs of placental abruption include:\nLower abdominal pain, sudden and prolonged pain, sometimes pregnant women feel in pain and want to faint;; Back-ache;; Uterine contractions last longer and are more intense than normal labor contractions;; Reduced fetal movements.\n\nDoes pregnant woman bleed during placental abruption?\nIn most cases of placental abruption, vaginal bleeding will be seen, except in cases of occult placental abruption, only when the placenta is removed after birth will a small hematoma be seen.\n\"When you notice vaginal bleeding or any other unusual symptoms during pregnancy, pregnant women need to immediately go to the hospital to be examined and determine the exact cause for timely and effective intervention and treatment.\" , Dr. Ngoc Anh shared more.\n\nIs placental abruption dangerous?\nAs mentioned, the placenta is an important organ that connects and receives nutrients from the mother to the fetus, ensuring that the fetus is continuously nourished until birth. When this condition occurs, the fetus can partially or completely lose oxygen and nutrients. If not intervened promptly, both mother and baby will face many dangerous complications. Detail:\nIn the fetus\nPremature birth: Means the fetus will be born before the 37th week. Statistics show that about 10% of premature babies are from mothers with placental abruption.; Developmental problems in children: Premature babies may have many health problems immediately after birth or at risk later; Stillbirth: This means the fetus dies in the mother's womb when the mother is at least 20 weeks pregnant.\nFetuses born to mothers with placental abruption may be born prematurely and have health problems\nIn pregnant women\nShock due to blood loss: This is a common complication in pregnant women with placental abruption, when blood is not passed through the placenta to nourish the fetus and is lost. Hemorrhagic shock occurs very quickly, more can accumulate in the uterus than flow out of the vagina. If not treated promptly, it can threaten the pregnant woman's life.; Blood clotting disorder: The disease can cause a lack of fibrinogenesis, leading to thin bleeding that does not clot after the fetus is delivered. If this condition lasts longer, it can cause more severe complications of blood clotting disorders, causing a lot of blood loss and endangering the life of the pregnant woman.; Due to lack of timely emergency treatment, hysterectomy may have to be considered to preserve the mother's life.\nIn addition, the disease is also the cause of many other dangerous complications such as hypertension, acute liver and kidney failure, adrenal insufficiency... Therefore, close monitoring of pregnancy and timely intervention and treatment of placental abruption is required. premature birth will help limit many dangerous complications, protect the health and life of pregnant women and fetuses.\n\nMethod of diagnosing placental abruption\nNormally, placental abruption will be diagnosed through examination and necessary paraclinical tests, the most common and convenient being ultrasound. Depending on the severity of symptoms, doctors may prescribe that pregnant women need hospitalization or home care.\nThe obstetrician will collect information about symptoms and examinations such as:\nAsk the pregnant mother if she has vaginal bleeding;; Ask where the pain symptoms are, whether the pain is mild or severe;; Ask about the time the symptoms started;; Monitor pregnant women's blood pressure;; Monitor fetal heart rate and movements;; Monitor uterine contractions in pregnant women;; Ultrasound is prescribed to determine the location of bleeding and check the condition of the fetus, blood and urine tests.\nSee more: Common symptoms of placental disease\n\nMethods of treating placental abruption\nDr. Ngoc Anh said, when placental abruption occurs, meaning the placenta separates from the uterine wall, there is no method to put the placenta back inside. Depending on the age of the fetus, the severity of the placental abruption, and the health status of mother and baby, the doctor will prescribe appropriate treatment.\nIn case the fetus is not yet full term (under 34 weeks old)\nThe doctor will direct the pregnant woman to the hospital for close monitoring until the fetus is 34 weeks old. If the fetal heart rate is normal and the pregnant woman does not have vaginal bleeding, the doctor will let the pregnant woman rest and monitor her daily at the hospital. At the same time, consider using lung growth medicine for the fetus.; However, if placental abruption is severe, the life of the pregnant woman and the fetus is threatened, and the pregnant woman needs immediate birth intervention.\nIn case the fetus is full term (34 weeks or more)\nIf the pregnant woman's labor is gentle and the fetal heart rate is stable, she can have a normal vaginal birth.; If labor is difficult or the fetus is in danger, the doctor will prescribe an emergency cesarean section to deliver the fetus, ensuring the life and safety of both the pregnant woman and the fetus. .\nPostpartum management should be based on the following factors:\nEstimated blood loss of pregnant women;; Conditions of organs at risk of being affected when placental abruption occurs (uterus, brain, kidneys...).; The pregnant woman's previous underlying medical condition.\n\nHow to prevent placental abruption?\nDr. Ngoc Anh shared, currently there is no way to prevent placental abruption, the risk factors can only be minimized by:\nDo not smoke, drink alcohol, use cocaine or stimulants during pregnancy.; Always wear a seat belt when riding, especially in the last 3 months of pregnancy. If unfortunately injured due to an accident, fall or an object hitting the abdomen, pregnant women need to immediately go to the nearest Obstetrics facility to check the condition and health of the fetus.; If you have a history of chronic hypertension or gestational hypertension, notify your obstetrician for care instructions and close pregnancy monitoring.; If you have a history of placental abruption in previous pregnancies and plan to continue pregnancy, you should consult your doctor to plan and prepare well to minimize the risk of illness in the next pregnancy. This.\nAlways wear a seat belt when riding in a car and be careful in all activities to help prevent placental abruption\n\nfrequently asked Questions\n1. Once you've had placenta abruption, will it happen again?\nStatistics show that about 15% of cases will experience placental abruption again if they have had a placental abruption once. If the placenta is separated twice, this risk increases to about 25%. Therefore, medical experts recommend that if pregnant women have had a placental abruption before, they need to notify their obstetrician for close pregnancy monitoring.\n2. What is the survival rate of the fetus when the mother has premature placental abruption?\nTwo factors that affect fetal survival are gestational age at birth and severity of placental abruption. Therefore, early detection and timely treatment are prerequisites to help minimize complications and increase the survival rate of the fetus after birth.\n3. Does sex during pregnancy cause placental abruption?\nSexual intercourse is not the cause of placental abruption. In most cases, sex during pregnancy is safe. However, you should avoid activities that pose a risk of falling or injury to the abdominal area.\n4. Does sneezing cause placental abruption?\nSneezing is a normal body reaction and is absolutely not a risk of placental abruption. If pregnant women have any concerns about frequent sneezing, strong coughing, etc., they can see an obstetrician to determine the condition and health of the fetus.\nObstetrics and Gynecology Center of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading Obstetrics and Gynecology experts, skilled and experienced, possessing the world's most modern machinery system, an ultrasound system 2D, 3D, 4D, color Doppler ultrasound, the latest generation Voluson E10 ultrasound system, applying modern treatment regimens in examination, diagnosis and treatment intervention to treat minor obstetric complications to complications, ensuring a safe pregnancy, a healthy mother and a healthy child.\nIn addition, the Obstetrics and Gynecology Center is also closely linked with many specialties at the hospital such as the Neonatal Center, Pediatrics Department, Cardiovascular Center, Diagnostic Imaging Center... to ensure that the baby is well cared for. Comprehensive care right from the moment of birth, optimal physical and intellectual development.\nTo schedule a consultation and examination appointment with Obstetrics specialists at Tam Anh General Hospital System, pregnant women and their families please contact:\nPlacental abruption is an extremely dangerous obstetric complication that needs to be detected and treated as soon as possible. Therefore, pregnant women need to carefully monitor unusual symptoms during pregnancy to go to the hospital early for timely and effective treatment!",
