Dinh Thi Hien Le.\n\nOverview of the placenta\nThe placenta is an organ formed inside the uterus during pregnancy, providing oxygen and nutrients for the developing fetus. Besides, the placenta also protects the fetus from impacts from the mother's body and the external environment. Therefore, placental diseases from the mother affect the health and development of the fetus while still in the mother's womb.\nThe placenta is round, about 15cm in diameter, weighs about 1/6 of the fetus's weight (about 400 - 500g), and is 2.5 - 3cm thick. Each placenta consists of 15 - 20 segments, between the segments are small grooves.\nThe placenta attaches to the wall of the mother's uterus and the fetus's umbilical cord, which is attached to the top, front, side, or back of the uterus. In a few cases, the placenta can attach to the lower uterus, even right above the cervix. When the placenta is low, it is a complication of placenta previa and can be dangerous for the pregnancy.\n\nWhat is placenta praevia?\nPlacenta previa (also known as placenta praevia) is a condition in which the placenta attaches to the lower uterine segment and cervix, partially covering or covering the cervix, obstructing the path of the fetus during labor. . In a normal pregnancy, the placenta attaches to the front or back of the base of the uterus. (first)\nBased on attachment position, placenta praevia is divided into 4 types:\nLow placenta: The edge of the placenta is attached to the lower part of the uterus, not reaching the internal cervix;; Placental adhesion: The edge of the placenta reaches the edge of the internal os of the cervix;; Semi-central placenta previa: The placenta partially covers the internal cervical os;; Central placenta previa: The placenta completely covers the internal cervix, accounting for 20-30% of cases.\n\nCauses of placenta praevia\nThe placenta can develop wherever the embryo implants in the uterus. If the embryo implants right in the lower part of the uterus, the placenta will develop there, which is the cause of placenta previa.\nMSc. Dinh Thi Hien Le shares some risk factors that can be found in pregnant women such as:\nHaving given birth many times;; Have a history of miscarriage or multiple abortions;; History of uterine infection;; Pregnant women have had placenta previa in previous pregnancies;; Large placenta due to multiple pregnancy;; The uterus has an abnormal shape;; Pregnant women get pregnant at an older age (over 35 years old);; Pregnant women use many stimulants, especially smoking;; The umbilical cord is attached to the membrane.\nPregnant women who smoke are at risk of developing complications of placenta praevia\n\nCommon symptoms\nSigns of placenta praevia vary depending on the clinical form and severity of the disease. However, pregnant women can recognize this phenomenon through symptoms during pregnancy including: (2)\nAbnormal vaginal bleeding (bright red blood, sometimes mixed with blood clots) but not painful, can be seen in the last 3 months of pregnancy;; Hemorrhage can occur naturally and stop suddenly without treatment. However, this condition can recur after a few days or weeks with increasing blood volume;; Some pregnant women may experience bleeding and abdominal pain due to uterine contractions.\n\nHow dangerous are complications of placenta previa?\nPlacenta previa can lead to bleeding during pregnancy and even at birth, causing many dangers and threats to the lives of both the pregnant woman and the fetus, specifically:\nFor pregnant women: The disease causes recurrent bleeding during pregnancy, causing pregnant women to become anemic and prone to premature birth. In cases where placenta previa attaches close to the cervix, after birth the placenta is dissected, causing the cervix to open, bacteria can easily penetrate, causing infection, and may even require a hysterectomy if the placenta is firmly attached to the body. uterus, cannot separate from the uterine lining; For the fetus: Anemia in the mother can cause malnutrition and fetal distress. When the mother bleeds too much, to save both mother and fetus, the doctor will prescribe an urgent cesarean section, even though the fetus is not yet full term, putting the premature baby at risk of respiratory failure. In addition, the fact that the placenta is located in the lower part of the uterus makes it difficult for the fetus to turn its head down, leading to a breech position (breech or transverse position) easily occurring.\nPlacenta previa threatens the lives of both mother and fetus if not treated promptly\nMaster and Doctor Dinh Thi Hien Le said that among the cases of the disease, the most dangerous is central placenta previa because the placenta completely covers the cervix. Therefore, when noticing the above-mentioned signs, pregnant mothers need to immediately go to reputable medical facilities to be examined, diagnosed and treated promptly, to avoid unfortunate cases from occurring.\n\nDiagnostic method\nDiagnosis is made through ultrasound. Thereby, it is possible to determine which area of ​​the uterus the placenta is attached to, such as the front, back, fundus, body, low attachment, semi-central or central anterior position. (3)\nUltrasound methods are also meaningful in diagnosing placenta previa and complications of placenta accreta. Ultrasound images show that the distance between the placenta and the bladder wall narrows, blood vessels penetrate the uterine muscle wall to the bladder wall on the Doppler ultrasound spectrum. It is often recommended that ultrasound be performed for early detection after the 28th week of pregnancy.\nPregnant women should have regular prenatal checkups to detect pregnancy complications early\n\nHow to treat?\nThe general principle of treating placenta previa is to stop bleeding to save the pregnant woman. Depending on the gestational age, level of bleeding, ability to nourish the newborn as well as assessing the appropriate level of blood transfusion, doctors will prescribe prolonging the gestational age or cesarean section.\n1. For placenta previa when not in labor\nPregnant women need to rest, limit travel, and follow a diet supplemented with nutrients;; Use tocolytic drugs such as spasmaverine 40mg (1-4 tablets/day), salbutamol, progesterone;; Corticosteroids can be used to help the fetus's lungs mature early;; In case of full-term fetuses: Doctors may prescribe elective cesarean section in cases of central placenta praevia, but in other cases, consider monitoring until labor;; In case of heavy bleeding of the placenta, threatening the life of the pregnant woman: Perform a cesarean section at any gestational age.\n2. For placenta previa during labor\nIn case of central or semi-central placenta previa: Caesarean section;; In case of placenta adhesion: Emergency cesarean section if the pregnant woman has heavy bleeding. If the pregnant woman has little bleeding and the position and cervix are favorable: Perform amniocentesis and tear the amniotic membrane toward the side without the placenta to stop the bleeding. After tearing the amniotic membrane, if there is still bleeding, then perform a cesarean section. If there is no bleeding, then follow the vaginal route;; In case of low attachment of the placenta: Caesarean section if there is a lot of bleeding, if there is little bleeding or no bleeding, labor should be monitored;\n3. For complications of placenta accreta\nComplications of placenta accreta are considered the most severe clinical form of placenta previa, at which time blood vessels proliferate in the lower part of the uterus, penetrating the bladder, often in pregnant women with old cesarean section incisions. Therefore, the surgery is very difficult, there is a lot of blood loss and damage to the bladder.\nIn this case, an elective cesarean section is needed at full term. The doctor will make an incision along the body of the uterus above the placenta or at the base of the uterus to remove the fetus. Doctors usually do not remove the placenta and perform a hysterectomy to minimize blood loss.\n\nHow to prevent placenta praevia?\nMs. Dinh Thi Hien Le, M.D., recommends that to have a healthy pregnancy and safe birth process, avoiding dangerous complications for both mother and fetus, pregnant women should:\nLimit pregnancy when you are old, do not recommend pregnancy when you have enough children;; Follow instructions for cesarean section to avoid unnecessary uterine scarring;; Do not smoke, and avoid inhaling cigarette smoke during pregnancy;; Rest, avoid heavy work;; Immediately go to reputable medical facilities for examination and accurate diagnosis when the above signs appear;; Hospitalized for monitoring when diagnosed with the disease in the last months of pregnancy.\nIt can be seen that placenta previa is one of the pregnancy complications that is dangerous for both the pregnant woman and the fetus. Pregnant women diagnosed with placenta previa need to be hospitalized for close monitoring, especially in the last months of pregnancy to have an accurate, comprehensive assessment and make an appropriate decision to terminate the pregnancy. The cesarean section surgery needs to be performed at a reputable medical facility, fully equipped with modern supporting machinery and equipment, as well as performed by a team of highly qualified and experienced doctors to ensure safety. for both mother and baby.\nTam Anh General Hospital brings together skilled experts and modern machinery to quickly handle obstetric complications, ensuring safety for mother and baby.\nObstetrics and Gynecology Department, Tam Anh General Hospital is equipped with modern machinery and equipment such as 4D ultrasound system, advanced GE E10 ultrasound machine, new generation color Doppler ultrasound machine... providing ultrasound images.
