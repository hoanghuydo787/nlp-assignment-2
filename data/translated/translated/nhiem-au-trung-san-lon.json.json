    "content": "Pork tapeworm infection: Causes, symptoms, treatment, prevention\n\nPork tapeworm larvae (1) (also known as cysticercosis, Cysticercus cellulosae) commonly appear in Asian countries including Vietnam. With the main economy being cultivation and animal husbandry, raising livestock in the form of free range in many families in Vietnam does not ensure hygienic treatment, along with the habit of preparing uncooked food, causing concern. Poor personal hygiene... are the reasons why many people are infected with tapeworm larvae.\n\nWhat are pork tapeworm larvae?\nCysticercosis is a parasitic infection caused by eggs and larvae of the pork tapeworm. Pork tapeworm larvae are also the cause of rice porcine disease in humans. Furthermore, when entering the body, this larva also causes other health risks to humans in the parts where it resides. (2)\nInvasion mechanism\nPork tapeworm larvae enter the human body through two mechanisms including:\nAccidentally swallowing pork tapeworm larvae in food, raw vegetables, drinking water...; Auto-infection through the fecal-oral route\nPork tapeworm eggs are spherical in shape, with a thick shell about 35mcm in diameter, containing 6-hooked embryos inside. When swallowing tapeworm eggs, the eggs will enter the intestines, 6-hook embryos are released, then penetrate the intestinal wall into the circulatory system, follow the blood vessels to locate and develop into cysts in parts such as the central nervous system. Urinary tract, eyes, subcutaneous tissue, muscles... Cysts calcify after several years, even decades, depending on the location of the parasite.\nPeople get rice porcine disease by eating raw or undercooked pork containing larval cysts or swallowing Taenia solium tapeworm eggs from old fluke segments dispersed in soil, water, aquatic vegetables... (3)\n\nSigns of infection with pork tapeworm larvae\nPork tapeworm eggs, after ingestion, will develop into larvae (called cysts), which can be found in all organs of the human body. Specifically:\n1. Under the skin and muscles\nThere are often no symptoms or sometimes muscle pain, nodules under the skin can be felt, detected by X-ray when the cyst has calcified.\n2. Nervous system\nWhen they enter the central nervous system, they can cause neurological symptoms, including seizures. Pork tapeworm larvae are the cause of: 30% of epilepsy cases in epidemic areas when humans and free-ranging pigs live near each other; 70% of epilepsy cases occur in high-risk areas and affect approximately 50 million people worldwide.\n3. Eyes\nCysts can reside in the eyelids, eye sockets, conjunctiva... Depending on the location of the parasite in the eye, the patient has symptoms of blurred vision, double vision, decreased vision, and watery eyes. Detection of larval cysts in the eye by ophthalmoscopy.\n4. Brain\nDepending on the location of the parasite in the brain, people infected with tapeworm larvae have symptoms such as epilepsy, headaches, increased intracranial pressure, and mental disorders.\n\nCause of cysticercosis\nBased on the mechanism of invasion, the cause of cysticercosis comes from the following reasons:\nEating undercooked pork causes people to become infected with larvae\nEating food contaminated with tapeworm eggs - usually found in uncooked raw vegetables, meat, fish...; Due to poor personal hygiene, not regularly washing hands with soap but only washing with water; not washing hands after defecation, vomiting... hands carry germs and then bring them to the mouth and begin the journey of tapeworms entering the body.\n\nSymptoms\nOnce inside the body, the larvae can escape from the intestines and infect other tissues and organs in the body, causing organ damage and, in severe cases, death.\nNeurocysticerci infection is a dangerous complication of pork tapeworm infection. The brain and nervous system are affected. Sufferers may experience symptoms of headaches, vision problems, seizures, meningitis and confusion. In very serious cases, the infection can be fatal.\n\nDiagnostic method\nTo diagnose pork tapeworm larvae, the doctor will base and prescribe the following methods:\nBased on epidemiological factors: living in the disease area; Blood tests: consider eosinophilia.; Diseases of the skin and muscles: diagnosed by biopsy method.; Eyes: use ophthalmoscope; Brain: diagnosed using CT scan, MRI (magnetic resonance) techniques to find abnormal images; Calcified round spots, ring-like circles, cerebral edema can be seen.; Immunodiagnosis.\n\nTreatment of tapeworm larvae\nTreatment methods when the body is infected with pork tapeworm larvae include:\nUse special medicine to treat tapeworms such as medicine containing the active ingredient Niclosamide...; Combine with corticosteroid anti-inflammatory drugs if the infection affects extraintestinal tissues.; Medicines to treat symptoms in the brain.\nNote, these medications need to follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and usage.\nIn cases where a person has a life-threatening cyst that has developed in vital organs such as the lungs or liver, surgery may be required. Your doctor may inject medication into the cyst (such as formalin) to kill the larvae before removing the cyst. (4)\n\nHow to prevent pork tapeworm larvae\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) offers 5 necessary factors to prevent pork tapeworm infection:\nEat cooked food and drink boiled food to help prevent the invasion of pork tapeworm larvae\nKeep food clean; Keep raw and cooked foods separate; Pork/beef should be cooked at a temperature of at least 70 degrees Celsius to kill larvae or eggs; Store food at safe temperatures; Use clean, safe water and raw materials\nIn addition, other prevention measures include:\nPets need to be treated for tapeworms. Pet food from meat, fish... also needs to be cooked.; Regularly clean all surfaces in the kitchen, clean and disinfect.; Block the source of the disease by completely treating the infected person, maintaining personal and external hygiene (avoiding open defecation).; Dispose of animal and human feces properly. Minimize animal exposure to tapeworm eggs. Raise livestock hygienically, do not let loose...; Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and clean water after going to the toilet and before eating.; If you live in an area where people have tapeworms, be sure to wash and cook all fruits and vegetables in clean water.; Do not store raw food with other food. Wash your hands after touching raw meat or fish; Experts also warn that smoking or drying meat or fish is not a reliable way to kill larvae or eggs.\nCurrently, the Testing Center - Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City is implementing Parasite Testing services, including: Stool testing (parasite screening) and Blood testing (parasite diagnostic serum).\nThe reason for getting accurate and timely test results for patients is because the Testing Center, Tam Anh General Hospital was invested in spacious construction, arranged with a modern and synchronous equipment system, meeting standards. Biosafety standard level 2.\nTo register for medical examination and parasite tests, customers can do so in the following ways: come directly to the hospital, register via hotline number 024 3872 3872 - 024 7106 6858 (Hanoi) – 0287 102 6789 – 093 180 6858 (HCMC).\nAfter the article above, everyone will understand somewhat about the danger of pork tapeworm infection. Therefore, in addition to always maintaining clean body hygiene, it is essential that our daily foods/drinks must always be fresh and well preserved. Eating cooked food and drinking boiled water is the best preventative measure to minimize the possibility of being infected with tapeworm larvae and other dangerous larvae.",
