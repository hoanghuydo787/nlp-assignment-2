    "content": "Parasitic infections: Causes, signs, diagnosis and treatment\n\nParasitic infection is a silent disease, caused by parasites invading the human body. They can \"live together in harmony\" in the human body for many years to reproduce, proliferate and absorb nutrients and blood from the host body. Patients may accidentally discover it when going for a general health check-up or regular medical check-up with tests and scans performed.\n\nWhat is a parasitic infection?\nParasitic infection is a common disease often found in countries with tropical and subtropical climates caused by worms, tapeworms, fleas, lice, ticks, lice... living parasitically in humans through infectious routes. such as transmission through soil, skin, digestive tract, from animals to humans...\nWhen parasites enter the human body, they suck human blood or nutrients to reproduce and develop, causing many harmful effects to the body such as damage to the liver, brain, lungs, kidneys, and malnutrition. , anemia... if not detected and treated promptly. (first)\nVietnam is a tropical country, with climatic conditions and living habits favorable for the development of parasites such as worm infections, flukes, malaria, etc.\n\nTransmission routes of parasites\nParasites can be transmitted through many different ways such as: digestion, skin surface, blood, animals, insects...\nGastrointestinal parasitic infections: Parasites can be present in food or water sources, when we eat uncooked food or unboiled drinking water. Gastrointestinal parasitic infections will have a number of symptoms such as: diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, bloating...; Parasitic infection through skin surface contact: Some parasite species attack our body through skin surface contact such as fleas, lice, lice, ticks...\nTransmitted through animals and plants: Many parasites live on animals such as roundworms of dogs and cats. When we hug, kiss, caress, or come into contact with animals, we will accidentally become infected.; Travel: Some parasites only develop specifically in certain countries and areas with favorable climates. When we travel and visit these places, we can be infected with parasites. For example, in Africa there is the roundworm Dracunculus medinensis that Vietnam does not have.\n\nSigns of parasitic infection in humans\nParasitic infections can be silent, or have warning signs, but can easily overlap with many common diseases. In addition, parasitic infections due to diverse types also have different manifestations. However, people infected with parasites may have the following symptoms:\nProlonged fever\nParasitic infections often have signs of prolonged fever, which can be high fever with body chills or can be fever for a short time and then stop. Sometimes fever is accompanied by abdominal pain, diarrhea, and loss of appetite.\nDigestive disorders\nDigestive disorders or symptoms of diarrhea, flatulence, and bloating are common signs in people infected with gastrointestinal parasites, but are easily confused with other intestinal diseases. Parasitic waste can cause constipation, bloating, and nausea in infected people.\nSymptoms of itching or hives\nParasitic diseases in humans will cause a number of skin problems such as red rashes, eczema, and allergies. In addition, waste from parasites accumulates in the skin, leading to swelling, skin damage, and inflammation over time.\nWeight loss, malnutrition\nParasitic infections affect intestinal activity. The patient's body is susceptible to symptoms such as constipation, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea. In addition, some parasite species suck blood and nutrients from the host, causing the host to lose weight and even become malnourished. .\nItching in the anal area\nAnal itching is a characteristic of people infected with worms, especially pinworms. Infected people often have itching around the anus at night, when female worms lay eggs.\nAnemia\nMost parasites, after entering the human body, will suck the host's blood to maintain life, grow and reproduce. Therefore, undetected parasitic infections can lead to anemia.\nPersonality changes\nIf infected with parasites, the patient's psychology will change to become anxious, insecure, and even affect the nerves through symptoms of poor concentration and memory loss.\n\nCauses of parasitic infection\nSome common parasites\nParasitic diseases are easily infected when there are favorable factors, especially in tropical countries with hot, humid climates and lots of rain, creating good conditions for parasites to easily spread and reproduce. In addition, living customs also create conditions for parasites to have the opportunity to \"attack\" humans. (2)\nIn Vietnam, the climatic conditions and living customs of some localities are still backward, easily creating conditions for parasites to develop. Typically, using animal manure to fertilize plants such as vegetables and untreated fruit trees creates conditions for parasites to infect. In addition, many people do not comply with eating cooked food and drinking boiled water.\nIn particular, parasites can exist in undercooked foods such as beef, pork, fish, crab, frogs or raw vegetables... which are the source of many helminthic pathogens, especially tapeworms or tapeworms. It is worrying that according to many people's opinion, fresh nutritious foods such as rare meat, \"eaten naturally\" without processing are good, but in fact they contain very high levels of parasitic pathogens.\n\nComplications of parasitic infection\nIf parasitic diseases are not detected and treated promptly, they will cause many dangerous complications such as: worms straying to important organs, intestinal obstruction, bile duct obstruction, meningitis, cardiovascular disorders. , pneumonia, enteritis, anemia, malnutrition.\nIn particular, for immunocompromised patients, the consequences can be severe and can lead to death if not detected and treated promptly.\n\nDiagnostic method\nParasites entering the human body can cause initial reactions such as fever and itching. But the initial mild symptoms are easily overlooked because they are easily confused with many other diseases. If parasites live \"in harmony\" with humans, then this is a silent disease, only discovered when accidentally going for a routine health check.\nParasite testing is the most used and most affordable method today to help doctors most accurately diagnose the type of parasites lurking and existing in the patient's body. From there, the doctor will recommend appropriate treatment methods. Depending on the different type of parasite, there are appropriate testing methods such as: stool and blood tests, PCR molecular biology, and additional supporting methods can be used for accurate identification such as machine testing. CT, MRI. (3)\nStool test: test for intestinal parasites to find eggs, larvae, cysts, and active forms of parasites excreted through stool. This method often uses an observation microscope; Blood test: There are 2 methods used: serum test and peripheral blood smear. Serological methods help find antibodies or antigens of parasites produced when the body is infected with parasites.; Testing samples of skin, hair, nails, and secretions: Depending on the type of parasite, there will be different methods of testing samples, such as using ink dyeing techniques, tissue culture to look for fungi.; Colonoscopy: Colonoscopy with modern machinery, sharp cameras, and magnification function will help detect parasites in the intestinal tract.; Testing for disease-causing intermediate hosts: In addition to testing sick people, we can test food, drinking water, and soil to find the source of disease transmission. The doctor may also prescribe a number of diagnostic support tests such as a peripheral blood cell analysis test to check whether eosinophils in the blood are elevated or not, liver enzyme tests, and blood cell analysis. urine…; Imaging diagnosis using X-ray, MRI, CT, ultrasound: Imaging diagnostic methods using X-ray, MRI, CT to support diagnosis of damage and complications caused by parasites attacking organs key functions such as heart, liver, lungs, brain...\n\nTreatment of parasitic infections\nSome parasitic diseases can be treated at home, some can be treated in the community. However, there are also many dangerous parasitic diseases that must be treated at medical facilities and according to the Ministry of Health's protocol.\n\nPrevent parasites from entering the body\nTo minimize the risk of parasitic infection, people need to change their daily habits, eat cooked food, drink boiled water, and wash their hands to proactively prevent parasites.\nPractice the habit of maintaining personal hygiene\nYou need to cut your nails neatly and cleanly, stop the habit of sucking or sucking your hands, touching your eyes, nose, mouth, or open wounds.; Wash your hands regularly and regularly every day, you need to wash your hands before eating, when preparing food, after going to the toilet...; Use your own personal hygiene kit: toothbrush, towel, hairbrush...; Eat cooked food and drink boiled food, do not eat fresh foods such as raw fish salad, undercooked meat, etc.\nRegularly clean personal belongings\nPersonal belongings that are not cleaned regularly will be at risk of becoming a place for parasites to live, including: toys, clothes, and personal items. Therefore, we must clean utensils and toys by cleaning and disinfecting, especially toys for young children. Children often hold, play with, and put in their mouths, thereby creating opportunities for worms and tapeworms to enter the body through the mouth.\nHygienic food\nAdults need to limit the habit of eating common raw foods such as blood pudding, raw fish, green vegetables, etc. and avoid eating at unhygienic restaurants.\nDeworm regularly\nRegular deworming for children and adults is an effective way to prevent parasitic diseases. We are also recommended by experts to deworm periodically, except for children under 1 year old and pregnant women in the first 3 months of pregnancy.\nBe fully equipped when exploring wild places\nMany dangerous parasites live in tropical climates, especially wild, humid climates. When we travel to these places, we need to wear clothes, bathe, and disinfect personal belongings regularly to avoid the risk of parasites sticking to clothes, skin, or open wounds. ... from there has the opportunity to enter the body.\nWarning about areas with parasites\n\nIntroducing parasite testing service at Tam Anh Hospital\nParasites are accurately diagnosed through paraclinical tests. Tests that can be ordered to determine whether a patient is infected with a parasite that can be performed include: Blood test, stool test, sputum test, keratinocytes test, disease tissue test... In addition, , patients are combined with other modern imaging diagnostic methods such as ultrasound, X-ray, CT-Scan, MRI to be able to make the most accurate diagnosis.\nAt Tam Anh General Hospital, investing in the most modern equipment system for Microbiology - Hematology - Parasitology testing such as: blood culture machine, Vitek II Compact automatic identification - antibiogram machine, Gram stain, Sysmex XN 1000 hematology analyzer system, extraction machine, PCR system... To serve in-depth paraclinical tests, the hospital is equipped with a 768-slice CT scanning system, X System - High-end ceiling-mounted digital optical GXR-52SD Ceiling System, MRI system, and new ultrasound machine.\nParasitic infection is a condition that frequently appears in tropical climates like Vietnam. The disease has symptoms similar to other common diseases, so it is difficult to recognize. Therefore, periodic deworming, cooked food and boiled water are essential to minimize the risk of infection.",
