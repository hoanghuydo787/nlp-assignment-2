    "content": "Ketoacidosis: Causes, symptoms and diagnosis\n\nThe frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis is 1 time/10,000 people/year. However, when surveying a population of diabetic patients, the frequency of ketoacidosis was 46 times/10,000 diabetics. So what is the cause of ketoacidosis? What are the symptoms and how to diagnose the disease?\n\nWhat is ketoacidosis?\nKetoacidosis is the accumulation of acid in a patient's blood. Occurs when blood sugar levels are too high and last for too long. The disease is common in people with type 1 diabetes and less common in people with type 2 diabetes. (1)\nKetoacidosis is a serious complication that can be life-threatening. Patients can treat and prevent ketoacidosis if they control their blood sugar well.\n\nMechanism of ketoacidosis\nA person has diabetes when the body does not produce enough insulin or does not use insulin effectively. Insulin is produced by the pancreas and plays an important role by \"connecting\" blood sugar to cells to feed the body. (2)\nWithout enough insulin, the body begins to break down fat for fuel, causing a buildup of acids in the blood called ketones. If the condition is left untreated, the buildup leads to diabetic ketoacidosis. If you have diabetes, do not ignore the warning signs of ketoacidosis. When a patient has ketoacidosis, they need to go to the emergency room.\n\nFactors that promote ketoacidosis\nThe two most common motivating factors are:\nHaving another illness: when sick, the patient does not eat and drink as much as usual, making blood sugar difficult to control. Not to mention, if the patient falls into an infection or becomes seriously ill, more hormones such as adrenaline or cortisol are produced. These hormones work against the effects of insulin, causing ketoacidosis more easily. Pneumonia and urinary tract infections are common illnesses that lead to ketoacidosis. (3); Insulin therapy: if a diabetic is prescribed insulin injections but for some reason forgets to inject or injects an insufficient dose or uses the wrong dose of insulin, it can lead to ketoacidosis.\nOther causes of ketoacidosis include:\nHeart attack or stroke.; Physical trauma such as a car accident or mental illness.; Abuse of alcohol or drugs, especially cocaine; Certain medications such as diuretics (water pills) and corticosteroids (treat inflammation in the body).; Pancreatitis.; Pregnancy.\nKetoacidosis is the accumulation of acid in a patient's blood.\n\nSymptoms of ketoacidosis\nKetoacidosis develops slowly. Initial symptoms include:\nThirsty.; Frequent urination.\nIf left untreated, symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis often appear quickly, sometimes within 24 hours and include:\nBreathe quickly and deeply.; Dry skin and mouth; Face flushed; Fruity breath smell; Headache.; Muscle stiffness or pain; Tired.; Nausea and vomiting.; Stomach-ache.\nSometimes ketoacidosis is a sign of diabetes in people who have not been diagnosed. Additionally, stronger signs of diabetic ketoacidosis appear in blood test kits  such as: high blood sugar. (4)\nThe risk of ketoacidosis is very high if the patient:\nHave type 1 diabetes; Often miss insulin doses.\nSometimes, ketoacidosis occurs in people with type 2 diabetes. In some cases, ketoacidosis is a sign of diabetes.\n\nHow to diagnose ketoacidosis\nCheck for ketones when the patient's blood sugar level is above 250mg/dL) or the patient has any of the above symptoms of high blood sugar such as dry mouth, feeling thirsty and urinating a lot. Some glucose meters also measure ketones. Try to lower your blood sugar and check your ketones again after 30 minutes.\nA physical exam and blood tests can diagnose ketoacidosis. In some cases, other tests are needed to find the cause of ketoacidosis.\n1. Blood test\nBlood tests used in diagnosing ketoacidosis:\nBlood sugar test: if the body is not provided with enough insulin to connect glucose into cells, blood sugar levels will increase - hyperglycemia. As the body breaks down fats and proteins for energy, blood sugar levels will continue to rise.; Ketone index: when the body breaks down fats and proteins for energy, acids called ketones enter the blood.; Blood acidity: ketone levels in the blood are too high, causing the blood to become acidic. This changes the way the body's organs work.\n2. Other testing methods\nDepending on the patient's health condition when admitted to the hospital, the doctor may prescribe a number of other tests to help find health problems and limit complications, including:\nBlood electrolyte test.; Chest X-ray.; ECG.; Arterial blood gases.; Blood pressure.; Test for signs of infection.\nPatients with ketoacidosis will be treated in the emergency room or hospitalized.\n\nTreatment measures for ketoacidosis\nPatients with ketoacidosis will be treated in the emergency room or hospitalized. Treatments for ketoacidosis include:\nRehydration: replaces fluids lost through frequent urination and dilutes excess sugar in the blood. Fluids may be given through the mouth or vein. In particular, IV fluids are given through a vein.; Electrolyte replacement: electrolytes are minerals in the blood such as sodium, potassium, chloride, which carry an electrical charge. Too little insulin will lower electrolyte levels in the blood. IV electrolytes are given to help the heart, muscles, and nerve cells function normally.; Insulin infusion: insulin reverses the conditions that cause ketoacidosis. In addition to fluids and electrolytes, insulin is given through a vein. Regular insulin treatment can be returned to when blood sugar levels drop to about 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) and the blood is no longer acidic.; Take medications for any underlying illness that causes ketoacidosis such as antibiotics to treat infections.\nPatients are closely monitored to detect any possible life-threatening problems such as brain, kidney or lung problems. Patients can be discharged from the hospital when they are well enough to eat and drink and tests show that the ketone level in the body is at a safe level. Before leaving the hospital, you need to understand the cause of ketoacidosis and how to prevent it.\n\nHow to prevent ketoacidosis\nThere are many ways to prevent ketoacidosis and other diabetes complications:\nDiabetes management: maintain a healthy diet and regular daily physical activity. Take diabetes medication or insulin as directed by your doctor.; Monitor blood sugar levels: patients need to check and record blood sugar levels at least 3-4 times a day and more often if they are sick or stressed. Monitor carefully and make sure your blood sugar is within your target range.; Adjust insulin dosage when necessary: ​​talk to your doctor if you intend to adjust your insulin dosage to suit yourself. Consider whether factors such as your blood sugar level, foods and activity level affect the disease. If your blood sugar begins to rise, follow your diabetes treatment plan to bring your blood sugar back into your target range.; Prepare to act quickly: If you think you have diabetic ketoacidosis because of high blood sugar, see your doctor immediately.\nPrevent ketoacidosis by maintaining a healthy diet and daily physical activity.\nKetoacidosis is a serious problem that occurs in people with diabetes if the body begins to run out of insulin. When this condition occurs, ketones build up in the body, becoming life-threatening if not detected and treated quickly. If you are concerned about ketoacidosis or have questions about your diabetes, see your doctor for appropriate examination and treatment. Tam Anh General Hospital with the specialty of Endocrinology - Diabetes has experienced and highly specialized doctors who help in the examination, diagnosis and timely treatment of patients.\nKetoacidosis is an acute complication of diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia, and metabolic acidosis. Through this article, we hope that patients, especially diabetics, will be able to recognize the symptoms of ketoacidosis, their causes, and how to diagnose them for timely treatment.",
