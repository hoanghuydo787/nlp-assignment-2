    "content": "Diabetic foot infections: Causes and symptoms\n\nThe reason why 60% of diabetics have to have their feet amputated is due to infection. After foot amputation, the patient death rate within 5 years is 50% - 60%. So how to identify the causes and symptoms of diabetic foot infections?\n\nWhat is diabetic foot infection?\nDiabetic foot infection is a diabetic foot injury caused by infection, ulceration, and/or deep tissue destruction associated with neurological abnormalities, some stages of the disease. Peripheral vascular and/or metabolic complications of the disease occur in the legs. This is a common and serious injury. (first)\n\nCauses of foot infections in diabetics\nThere are many causes of diabetic foot infection such as neurological complications, ischemia, nutritional dysfunction and infection. However, the main mechanism is due to lack of blood supply to diabetic feet. The disease can be caused by local damage or peripheral blood vessel damage. Peripheral nerve damage is a common complication of diabetes, appearing in about 50%-70% of cases. This damage affects sensory, motor and autonomic nerve fibers. Since then, the patient's feet are no longer sensitive to common painful stimuli. For the most part, ulcers often originate from small injuries, gradually damaging motor fibers causing muscle weakness, muscle atrophy and mild paralysis. Ultimately, the patient's feet become deformed, with increased pressure points appearing, causing calluses and thickening of the feet, combined with frequent walking, leading to tears and tissue inflammation, which gradually leads to foot ulcers. Peripheral nerve damage also causes the body to reduce sweating and change the skin's defense structure, so when outside microorganisms enter, the skin becomes dry and cracked, causing foot infections. (2)\nLimb necrosis due to vascular occlusion causing anemia: More than 30% of diabetic foot ulcer cases are related to peripheral vascular disease. Vascular changes are characterized by changes typical of atherosclerosis, the skin appears red - a factor that makes ulcers more susceptible to complications and difficult to treat.\nDiabetic foot ulcers create conditions for local or systemic infection and the risk of lower limb amputation. Amputation not only causes the patient mental crisis but also causes economic and social losses.\nDiabetic foot infection.\n\nRisk factors for developing diabetic foot infections\nIn addition to peripheral nerve damage, peripheral vascular disease and infections, people with diabetes face foot infections due to a number of identified risk factors such as: microtrauma, structural deformities. structure, limited joint mobility, appearance of calluses, prolonged hyperglycemia, uncontrolled hyperglycemia, history of foot ulcers or amputation. (3)\nAbout 25% of people with diabetes will develop serious foot problems. If a person is diagnosed with diabetes, there is a high chance of developing a diabetic foot infection. However, there are additional activities that put people at higher risk of infection such as:\nStanding for long periods in cold and wet conditions will increase leg numbness and dry skin. Both of these increase the risk of infection.; Do not soak your feet, especially in Epsom bath salts, as this will increase the risk of infection.; Not wearing socks loses the opportunity to protect the skin of the feet.; Wearing uncomfortable shoes causes blisters; Not washing your feet regularly and thoroughly.; Drink beer.; Smoking inhibits blood circulation; Not cutting or cutting toenails incorrectly can cause skin tears.\nDiabetic foot infections are more common in people with heart disease, body disease, and eye disease (due to diabetes). Older men and obese people are more likely to get diabetic foot infections.\nOnce an ulcer forms, it is a race against time to heal before infection occurs. People with diabetes have a reduced ability to fight infections and nutritional deficiencies make treatment difficult.\n\nSymptoms of diabetic foot infection\nSymptoms of a diabetic foot infection are similar to any other infection. The area around the wound turns red and spreads beyond its original location. People with diabetic foot infections will have pain and sensitivity at the wound site and the wound will initially drain pus.\nAs the infection develops, symptoms such as:\nFever.; Chills and sweats.; Short of breath.; Stuffy nose.; Stiff neck.; New ulcers appear.\nPeople with diabetic foot infections may notice black tissue called scabs surrounding the ulcer. This condition forms in case of lack of blood supply. Partial or complete necrosis occurs around the ulcer, producing exudate, pain, and numbness.\nImportantly, most patients do not realize the danger until the wound becomes infected. If the patient is showing signs of infection in the feet or other parts, see a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology - Diabetes for timely examination and treatment.\nThe incidence of diabetic foot infections is more common in elderly patients and people with other diseases.\n\nHow to diagnose diabetic foot infections\nThe doctor will make a diagnosis of diabetic foot infection after examining and testing for local signs of infection such as swelling, discharge, systemic signs, fever, etc. The doctor removes any tissue. Existing necrosis and wound cleaning.\nTesting: the doctor can take a sample and send it to the Testing Center to determine what type of bacteria and germs have \"attacked\" and prescribe the appropriate antibiotic.; Imaging: If your doctor suspects the infection is serious, he or she will order X-rays and look for signs of bone infection.\nYour doctor will make a diagnosis of diabetic foot infection after examination and testing.\n\nTreatment of diabetic foot infections\nThe incidence of diabetic foot infections is more common in elderly patients and people with other diseases. Both men and women are affected equally. The risk of death is higher in patients with chronic osteomyelitis or acute necrotizing soft tissue infections and underlying problems affecting the immune system. Therefore, patients need to treat diabetic foot infections early.\nAntibiotics: Most infections are treated with antibiotics to treat diabetic foot infections. The duration of antibiotic treatment is usually 2 - 4 weeks. People with osteomyelitis need at least 6 weeks of treatment. However, patients are prescribed platelet antibiotics and anticoagulants when the infection progresses. If the wound is not treated by a doctor, the infection will spread, causing pain, discomfort, necrosis, and in the worst case, amputation; Basic treatment: Before prescribing treatment for diabetic foot infections. The doctor will perform basic hygiene and treatment steps first, including: Clean the wound and surrounding area. Eliminates foot ulcers. Remove dead skin and potential foreign objects. Dress the wound with treatments such as silver cream, sulfadiazine, polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) gel, and iodine.; Clean the wound and surrounding area.; Eliminates foot ulcers.; Remove dead skin and potential foreign objects.; Dress the wound with treatments such as silver cream, sulfadiazine, polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) gel, and iodine.; Hyperbaric oxygen therapy: can prevent amputation. Hyperbaric oxygen helps patients: Increase oxygen supply to ischemic or hypoxic tissues. Enhance white blood cell-mediated bacterial destruction. Angiogenesis. Increase collagen synthesis. Fibroblast growth. Reduces edema; Enhance oxygen supply to ischemic or hypoxic tissues.; Enhance white blood cell-mediated bacterial killing; Angiogenesis.; Increase collagen synthesis.; Fibroblast growth.; Reduces edema; Wear support items: people with diabetes can wear shoes, casts, and use compression bandages and insoles designed specifically for each individual to prevent calluses. The presence of calluses increases the likelihood of ulcer formation 11 times. Surgical excision: in some cases, patients have surgery to treat ulcers. In extremely severe cases, amputation is necessary to remove necrotic skin and prevent the infection from spreading to other parts.\n\nHow to prevent diabetic foot infections\nCheck your feet regularly as part of your daily routine, such as right after brushing your teeth at night. Wash your feet regularly and use moisturizer to prevent cracked skin.; Wear comfortable shoes, not bare feet and tight socks as this increases the risk of injury.; Trim your nails regularly, avoid extreme heat, and treat calluses whenever possible.\nIf the patient finds that the foot has any problems or does not heal with home treatment, see a doctor to have the diabetic foot infection examined and treated as soon as possible.\nCheck your feet regularly and make it a daily habit.\nDiabetic foot infections have difficult and serious effects if left unchecked. It is important that patients follow their doctor's instructions during treatment. Tam Anh General Hospital with the specialty of Endocrinology - Diabetes has leading experts, experienced and highly specialized doctors who help the process of examination, diagnosis and timely treatment for patients.\nDiabetic foot infections are a common complication of poorly controlled diabetes and are often infected. Through this article, we hope that patients, especially those with diabetes, know the causes and symptoms of this disease so that they can check, prevent and treat wounds promptly.",
