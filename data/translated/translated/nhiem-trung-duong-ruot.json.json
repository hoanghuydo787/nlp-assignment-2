    "content": "Intestinal infections: Symptoms, causes and prevention\n\nIntestinal infections arise from many different causes, mainly due to the activity of bacteria, viruses and parasites. The disease manifests with many painful and uncomfortable symptoms such as: abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, loose stools... Depending on the severity, the doctor will prescribe appropriate treatment methods to limit complications. danger.\n\nWhat is intestinal infection?\nIntestinal infection is a condition in which damage to the digestive tract occurs due to the invasion of harmful microorganisms. This disease can appear in anyone, at any time, leading to many uncomfortable and inconvenient problems. If the infection is not treated promptly, there is a risk that it will lead to more serious health complications.\nInvasion of harmful microorganisms leads to intestinal infection\n\nCauses of intestinal infection\nBelow are some typical causes of intestinal infections: (1)\n1. Bacteria cause intestinal infections\nCommon types of bacteria: E.coli, salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria, Bacillus cereus, Vibrio, Clostridium botulinum...\nE. coli: E. coli bacteria are found in the intestines of humans and animals, mostly harmless strains. However, some strains, such as ETEC, EPEC, EIEC,... have the ability to secrete toxins, causing abdominal pain, vomiting and bloody diarrhea. This group of bacteria is often spread through contaminated water, food in contact with animal feces, etc.; E. coli: E. coli bacteria are found in the intestines of humans and animals, mostly harmless strains. However, some strains, such as ETEC, EPEC, EIEC,... have the ability to secrete toxins, causing abdominal pain, vomiting and bloody diarrhea. This group of bacteria is often spread through contaminated water sources, food in contact with animal feces...\nSalmonella bacteria: Salmonella infection is often caused by eating undercooked poultry, meat, and eggs. Typical symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever, appear 12 - 72 hours after infection and take 4 - 7 days to recover.; Salmonella bacteria: Salmonella infection is often caused by eating undercooked poultry, meat, and eggs. Typical symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever, appear 12 - 72 hours after infection and take 4 - 7 days to recover.\n2. Viruses cause intestinal infections\nNorovirus: This is the most typical factor causing food-borne intestinal infections. Norovirus has the ability to spread between people in a limited space. Many cases are transmitted through contaminated water or food; Norovirus: This is the most typical factor causing food-borne intestinal infections. Norovirus has the ability to spread between people in a limited space. Many cases are transmitted through contaminated water or food.\nRotavirus: Rotavirus is the leading cause of intestinal infections in children worldwide. The main route of transmission is by touching objects contaminated with the virus and then touching your hands to your mouth without cleaning. Currently, some countries have vaccines available; Rotavirus: Rotavirus is the leading cause of intestinal infections in children worldwide. The main route of transmission is by touching objects contaminated with the virus and then touching your hands to your mouth without cleaning. Currently, some countries have vaccines available.\n3. Parasites cause intestinal infections\nTwo types of parasites that commonly cause intestinal infections include:\nGiardia: This is a parasite that causes intestinal infection, spread through person-to-person contact or contaminated water. Giardia is resistant to chlorine so it can still survive in public swimming pools.; Giardia: This is a parasite that causes intestinal infection, spread through person-to-person contact or contaminated water.

Common symptoms include: bloating, abdominal cramps, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea... These signs usually appear clearly after 7 - 10 days of exposure. Accordingly, both types of parasites are often found in water and are infected after eating or drinking.\nIntestinal infections can be caused by bacteria, viruses or parasites\n\nWho is at risk of intestinal infections?\nBelow are 3 groups of people at highest risk of intestinal infections:\nYoung children and infants: This group has an incompletely developed immune system, so it is susceptible to attacks by bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Accordingly, the report shows that infectious diarrhea accounts for 1 in 9 deaths in children worldwide, with 2,195 cases per day, more than AIDS, malaria and measles combined.; Young children and infants: This group has an incompletely developed immune system, so it is susceptible to attacks by bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Accordingly, the report shows that infectious diarrhea accounts for 1 in 9 child deaths worldwide, with 2,195 cases per day, more than AIDS, malaria and measles combined.\nElderly people: This group has a weakened immune system and digestive system, so they are vulnerable to bacteria, viruses, and parasites; Elderly people: This group has a weakened immune system and digestive system, so they are vulnerable to bacteria, viruses, and parasites.\nPeople living in unsanitary environments: This is a favorable environment for bacteria, viruses, and parasites to grow and spread quickly.; People living in unsanitary environments: This is a favorable environment for bacteria, viruses, and parasites to grow and spread quickly.\nChildren are one of the groups at risk of intestinal infections\n\nSymptoms of intestinal infection\nSymptoms of intestinal infection will vary depending on the cause of the disease.(2)\nSome of the signs that may be encountered include:\nStomach-ache.; Diarrhea.; Nausea.; Fever.; Chills.; Cramp.; Headache.; Blood appears in the stool.\n\nWhen should I see a doctor?\nPatients should immediately contact their doctor if they notice the following serious symptoms:\nFever.; Severe abdominal pain; Appearance of blood or mucus in stools; Diarrhea lasts more than 2 â€“ 3 days; The body shows signs of dehydration.\nFor children under 3 months old, parents should take them to the emergency room in the following cases:\nThe body shows signs of dehydration (not urinating, pale face, sunken eyes, cold hands and feet or very irritable).; Children have severe stomach pain; Fever.; Do not breastfeed.\nFor toddlers, below are serious signs of intestinal infection that require urgent contact with a doctor:\nContinuous diarrhea that does not go away; Appearance of blood in stool.; Unusual weight loss.\nPatients should contact their doctor immediately when symptoms begin to become serious\n\nComplications of intestinal infection\nIntestinal infections rarely cause complications in healthy adults and usually go away in less than a week. However, young children and the elderly are often more susceptible to the disease due to their weak immune systems, and are at risk of facing many serious complications if not treated early. Specifically includes:\nHigh fever.; Muscle pain; Inability to control bowel movements; CKD.; Intestinal bleeding.; Anemia.\n\nMethods of treating intestinal infections\nYour doctor will prescribe treatment for intestinal infections based on the cause and severity of symptoms. Accordingly, some commonly applied measures include:\nRehydration: This is a very important home treatment. Patients can rehydrate and electrolytes themselves with solutions such as oresol mixed in the right ratio, coconut water, porridge water, etc. to compensate for the amount of water and electrolytes lost due to diarrhea and vomiting. Newborns will drink breast milk or formula (should be given rehydration or water for the first 12 hours, then give formula milk as usual in smaller quantities, more times).(3) ; Rehydration: This is a very important home treatment.
