    "content": "Salmonella bacterial infection: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis, prevention\n\nSalmonella infection is common and can occur at any age. The disease comes from many different sources of infection and appears with many unpleasant symptoms, typically diarrhea and abdominal pain. This condition, if not treated early, can lead to dangerous complications and even death. Therefore, monitoring the disease and promptly contacting a doctor is really necessary.\n\nWhat is salmonella bacteria?\nSalmonella is a type of intestinal bacteria that does not form spores and mainly moves by flagella around the body. This group of chemotrophs mainly obtains energy from redox reactions, capable of generating ATP using oxygen when available or using electron acceptors or fermentation when oxygen is not available. (first)\nSalmonella is also a facultative intracellular pathogen that can invade a variety of cell types, including epithelia, M cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. The disease caused by this microorganism is called salmonellosis, causing gastrointestinal discomfort, fever, diarrhea and abdominal cramps.\nIn most cases, the disease comes from contaminated food sources (contaminated with human or animal feces) that sick people eat. Accordingly, salmonella strains can be divided into two main groups including typhoid and non-typhoid. The second group is often more common, can infect many types of animals and is transmitted directly from animals to humans.\nIn contrast, the typhoid group that includes Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A, B, and C occurs only in humans and does not occur in other animals. Non-typhoidal group caused by other Salmonella mainly causes enteritis and septicemia.\n\nSymptoms of salmonella infection\nPatients infected with salmonella bacteria are often infected with raw meat, poultry, eggs or egg products, and unpasteurized milk. The incubation period (time from exposure to onset of illness) can range from 6 hours - 6 days. Normally, people infected with salmonella will tend to confuse it with a common stomach ache. Among them, some typical signs include: (2)\nDiarrhea; Stomach cramps; Fever; Nausea; Vomiting; Chills; Headache; Blood appears in the stool\nThe above symptoms usually last from a few days to a week. Diarrhea usually lasts about 10 days but can take several months before the intestines return to a stable bowel habit.\n\nCauses of salmonella infection\nSalmonella bacteria live in the intestines of humans, animals and birds. Most infections are caused by consuming contaminated food or water containing feces. Specifically as follows: (3)\n1. Food and water contain sources of infection\nRaw meat, poultry and seafood: Feces can stick to poultry during the slaughtering process, and seafood can also be contaminated when living in polluted water.; Unpasteurized milk and milk products: Unpasteurized milk and milk products may be contaminated with salmonella. Meanwhile, pasteurization can remove harmful bacteria, including salmonella.; Fruits and vegetables: Fresh fruits and vegetables, especially imported varieties, can be contaminated with salmonella during the process of fertilizing or preparing and cleaning with water.; Raw or undercooked eggs: Although the eggshell protects the inside from contamination, infected birds can still lay eggs containing salmonella bacteria (which exist before the shell is formed). This is the source of infection when humans eat it.\n2. Improperly handled food\nMany foods are contaminated with salmonella bacteria due to unhygienic processing, mainly due to not washing hands thoroughly before preparing.\n3. Source of infection from pets and other animals\nAnimals in general, including pets, especially birds and reptiles, can carry salmonella bacteria on their fur, skin and feces. Therefore, this is also a source of infection that should be paid attention to.\n4. Risk factors\nDaily activities bring the body into closer contact with salmonella bacteria.; The body's ability to fight infections is weakened due to health problems.; International travel: Salmonellosis is more common in developing countries with poor sanitation. Therefore, tourists are also at higher risk of infection if they go to these countries.; Contact with animals: Some animals can carry salmonella bacteria, in addition, this type of microorganism is also easily found in cages, tanks, cages, and litter trays of pets.; Stomach or intestinal disorders: The body has many natural defenses against salmonella infection, such as strong stomach acid. However, some medical problems or medications can impair this ability, including antacids, antibiotics, immune problems, inflammatory bowel disease, etc.\n\nDiagnostic method\nMost cases of salmonella infection are diagnosed based on symptoms. In addition, the doctor may also prescribe the following additional tests to get the most accurate conclusions: (4)\nStool sample testing; Blood sample testing\n\nComplications may occur\nSalmonella infection is rarely life-threatening. However, in infants, young children, the elderly, organ transplant recipients, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, the likelihood of developing serious complications is higher. Diarrhea caused by salmonella infection easily causes the body to become dehydrated. Some common warning signs include:\nUrinating less than usual; Dark urine; Feeling of dry mouth and tongue; Sunken eyes; Does not produce tears when crying; The body is more tired than usual; Sepsis\nSalmonella bacteria entering the bloodstream will cause sepsis, which can infect all tissues of the body, including:\nUrinary system (urinary tract infection).; Tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord (meningitis).; Pericardium of the heart or valves (endocarditis).; Bone or bone marrow (osteomyelitis).; Reactive arthritis\nPeople infected with salmonella are at high risk of developing reactive arthritis. Some common symptoms include:\nAthritis; Eye irritation; Burning pain when urinating\n\nTreatment of salmonella infection\nMost cases with healthy constitutions can recover within a few days to a week without the need for complicated treatment. Here are some commonly prescribed methods:\n1. Treat dehydration\nFor salmonella infection, patients need to focus on replenishing lost fluids and electrolytes. In cases of severe dehydration, the optimal choice is emergency room care with intravenous fluids.\n2. Medicine\nIn addition to providing enough water, the doctor will base on the severity of the infection to prescribe the following medications:\nAnti-diarrhea drugs: Drugs such as Loperamide can help reduce symptoms of abdominal pain caused by diarrhea but at the same time can also prolong diarrhea caused by infection.; Antibiotics: Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to kill bacteria if salmonella is suspected to have entered the bloodstream, causing infection or weakening the immune system.\n\nPrevent infection with salmonella bacteria\nSalmonella infection can be effectively prevented by stopping the source of infection in the first place. As follows:\nFor food\nDo not prepare food for others when you are sick; Always wash your hands with soap and clean water after going to the toilet; Wash hands thoroughly before and after preparing food or eating; Clean surfaces and food preparation utensils before and after use; Make sure food is cooked to a safe temperature before eating; Do not handle any other foods while preparing or processing raw meat, poultry, seafood or eggs; Wash fruits and vegetables before processing; Refrigerate or freeze meat, poultry, and seafood as soon as possible if not in use; Do not drink unpasteurized milk and dairy products; Do not drink untreated water or eat food prepared with untreated water\nFor pets\nWash your hands with soap and water after touching animals (including pets), including their food, water bowls, litter boxes, droppings, cages or toys.; Do not touch or put your hands in your mouth after touching an animal; Do not kiss the fur or skin of animals or pets; People with weakened immune systems, children under 5 years old, and elderly people over 65 years old should absolutely not touch high-risk animal groups; Clean your pet's living environment, such as fish tanks, cages, etc.; Do not use the kitchen sink to bathe or clean pets or their toys.\nCenter for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City) and Department of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreatic (Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing High-class, effective examination and treatment services for patients with mild to severe liver problems (fatty liver, acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer...). Tam Anh General Hospital system brings together a team of highly specialized and experienced Internal Medicine - Surgery - Gastrointestinal Endoscopy doctors, in addition to the support of a modern medical equipment system imported from abroad. in addition, serving the maximum examination and treatment needs of customers.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of liver diseases with gastroenterology specialists of Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nAbove is a summary of all information related to salmonella infection. Hopefully through these shares, patients will have more useful updates to proactively prevent, detect and effectively treat the disease.",
