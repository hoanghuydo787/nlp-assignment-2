    "content": "Atrial tachycardia: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis, prevention\n\nAtrial tachycardia accounts for 5-15% of all supraventricular tachycardia, commonly seen in patients with congenital heart disease or after surgery.\n\nWhat is atrial tachycardia?\nAtrial tachycardia is an arrhythmia originating from the atria, defined as a fast heart rate caused by abnormal rhythm generators from the atria.\nIn the case of atrial tachycardia, the electrocardiogram usually shows a tachycardia with a narrow QRS complex (unless there is accompanying aberrant conduction). The disease often has a fast heart rate of 150-250 beats per minute. Atrial rhythm is usually regular. (first)\nIn atrial tachycardia, the upper floors of the heart (atria) may beat as fast or as fast as the lower floors (ventricles). Abnormal rhythm generators in the atria have a higher frequency than other normal rhythm generators (such as the sinus node) and therefore take over control of the heart rate, causing rapid heart beat.\nThey can appear in 3 ways:\nIncreased automaticity.; Initiation activities; Re-entry phenomenon.\n\nWho is susceptible to the disease?\nAtrial tachycardia is a type of supraventricular tachycardia that occurs in the atria (upper chambers of the heart). This disease can be cured by eliminating the arrhythmia or controlling it with medication. In general, the disease can happen to anyone. However, age is also a factor that increases the risk of this condition.\nThis is a fairly common disease and is more common in older people. There are about 90,000 new cases of paroxysmal (brief) tachycardia each year in the United States.\n\nClassify\nMSc.BSc.CKI Vu Xuan Quang, Doctor at the Cardiovascular Center of Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, said there are two types of atrial tachycardia: (2)\n1. Unifocal atrial tachycardia\nUnifocal atrial tachycardia (often referred to as atrial tachycardia) is generated from a specific (focal) location in the heart and is usually less dangerous. However, this condition can still cause symptoms that affect health and quality of life, and even lead to long-term complications if not treated appropriately.\n2. Multifocal atrial tachycardia\nIn some cases, atrial tachycardia may have more than one source of rhythm, called multifocal atrial tachycardia. This type of atrial tachycardia may be easier to diagnose but more difficult to treat. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other serious medical conditions are common causes.\n\nSymptoms of atrial tachyarrhythmia are common\nSometimes, atrial tachycardia episodes only occur for a short time and the patient does not feel the symptoms. In adults, symptoms often include: (3)\nNervous;; Heart beating fast;; Dizziness, lightheadedness;; Fainting, unconsciousness;; Chest pain;; Short of breath.\nAtrial tachycardia in infants and young children can cause the following symptoms:\nCrying;; Poor breastfeeding;; Breathe quickly.\n\nIs atrial tachycardia the same as atrial fibrillation?\nMSc.BS.CKI Vu Xuan Quang said that atrial tachycardia is different from atrial fibrillation.\nAtrial tachycardia usually causes the upper chambers of the heart to beat at 100-250 beats/minute. However, this number may be higher in children and infants. Although the heart rate is abnormally fast, it rarely interferes with the heart's ability to pump blood normally.\nAtrial fibrillation is very dangerous because it causes the upper chambers of the heart to beat at 350-600 beats/minute. When this happens, the upper part of the heart barely works, can't fill with blood, and doesn't pump all the blood already inside. This causes blood to pool, leading to clot formation. Blood clots that travel from the heart to the brain cause strokes or arterial embolisms in other organs where the clot travels.\nAtrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation are both dangerous heart diseases.\n\nCauses of atrial tachycardia\nAtrial tachycardia occurs most commonly in elderly patients and those with other types of heart disease. Sometimes the disease also occurs in children, young adults and people with healthy hearts.\nAccording to MSc.BS.CKI Vu Xuan Quang, factors that increase the risk of disease include:\n“Enlarged” atria due to hypertension or cardiomyopathy;; Previous myocardial infarction;; Excessive use of alcohol, cocaine and other stimulants;; Sometimes atrial tachycardia is idiopathic, no specific cause can be found.\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nPatients should see a Cardiology specialist immediately if they suddenly have the following symptoms:\nShortness of breath;; Anxiety, palpitations;; Fast heart beat;; Have chest pain;; Lots of dizziness;; Unconsciousness for unknown reasons.\nThese symptoms are not only seen in atrial tachycardia but also appear in many other serious cardiovascular diseases (such as myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia,...).\n\nMethod for diagnosing atrial tachycardia\nParaclinical methods used to diagnose atrial tachycardia include: (4)\nBlood tests: Check for thyroid disorders, heart disease, or other conditions related to atrial tachycardia.; Electrocardiogram (ECG): Measures the heart's electrical activity and heart rate, helping to accurately diagnose tachycardia; Holter ECG: A portable electrocardiogram monitor worn for a day or more to record the heart's electrical activity during daily activities. Echocardiogram: Checks the structure and activity of the heart.\nEchocardiography is one of the diagnostic methods.\nBesides, doctors can also diagnose atrial tachycardia using other methods, such as:\nStress test: Monitor heart activity when walking on a rolling mat or riding a bicycle with a dynamometer.; Electrophysiological study (EP study) and electrical mapping of the heart chambers: Allows doctors to examine electrical activity in the heart and determine the location of arrhythmias, often combined with ablation of arrhythmias.\n\nComplications of atrial tachycardia\nSustained atrial tachycardia can lead to cardiomyopathy (weakening of the heart muscle) and heart failure. This cardiomyopathy is usually reversible if the disease is controlled. Sometimes atrial tachycardia can lead to another, more serious type of arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation.\n\nCan atrial tachycardia be cured?\nMSc.BSc.CKI Vu Xuan Quang said that depending on the type of atrial tachycardia, there are different treatment methods:\nUnifocal atrial tachycardia: Has a very high cure rate, especially when applying arrhythmia ablation techniques.; Multifocal atrial tachycardia: The disease is often caused by other serious medical diseases.\nTreatment is more difficult because there are many different arrhythmia foci in the heart. However, treating other diseases (which cause the condition) may resolve multifocal atrial tachycardia. If there are no symptoms and the atrial tachycardia only lasts for a short time, the doctor only needs to monitor the patient's condition in combination with adjusting accompanying medical diseases.\nIn some cases, especially those that last only a short time, atrial tachycardia may go away on its own.\nDoctors at Arrhythmia Unit, Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City perform arrhythmia ablation for patients.\n\nHow to prevent atrial tachycardia\nAtrial tachycardia is unpredictable and cannot be prevented. However, according to MSc.BSc.CKI Vu Xuan Quang, it is possible to reduce the risk of developing the disease by avoiding potential factors and effectively preventing atrial tachycardia such as:\nLimit alcohol intake: Drinking too much alcohol has negative effects on the heart.; Limit stimulants: Including caffeine, cocaine, methamphetamine, chocolate; At the same time, do not abuse prescription drugs.; Quit smoking and do not use tobacco products: This includes all e-cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products.; Managing your health with diet and exercise: This helps delay or prevent medical conditions from developing (such as coronary artery disease).\n\nNote for patients with atrial tachycardia\nIf diagnosed with the disease, Vu Xuan Quang, M.D., M.D., notes to patients the following:\nRegular follow-up visits: Follow-up visits help monitor disease progression, early detect long-term complications of the disease or other newly appearing conditions.; Take the full medication and correct dose: This is especially important for patients with atrial tachycardia who have not been treated with medication or intervention to eradicate the arrhythmia.; Managing overall health: Diet and exercise both play an important role in heart health. Your doctor will give you advice on how to eat right, stay active, and stay healthy in ways that are good for your heart.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment for atrial tachycardia and cardiovascular diseases at the Heart Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nWhen atrial tachycardia only lasts for a short time, it may not be dangerous. However, when atrial tachycardia persists or occurs more frequently, it can cause cardiomyopathy, weakening and damaging the heart. Early detection screening helps timely and effective treatment and prevents dangerous complications leading to heart failure and even death.",
