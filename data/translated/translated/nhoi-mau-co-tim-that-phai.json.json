    "content": "Right ventricular myocardial infarction: Causes, signs and treatments\n\nRight ventricular myocardial infarction that is treated promptly has a good prognosis, but strict long-term management is needed to prevent life-threatening complications. This article is expertly advised by Vo Anh Minh, MSc. Vo Anh Minh - Doctor at the Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nWhat is right ventricular myocardial infarction?\nRight ventricular myocardial infarction, also known as acute right ventricular myocardial infarction, occurs when blood flow to part of the heart is reduced or completely stopped, causing irreversible damage to the heart muscle. Right ventricular myocardial infarction is much less common than left ventricular myocardial infarction. (first)\nThe disease has a high risk of death\n\nCauses of right ventricular myocardial infarction\nMSc. Vo Anh Minh - Doctor at the Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, said that the main cause of right ventricular myocardial infarction is atherosclerotic plaque blocking the proximal part of the right coronary artery. (atherosclerosis). This condition leads to ischemia in the right heart, increasing the risk of death when there is an acute myocardial infarction.\nThe right ventricle (RV) receives its arterial blood supply primarily from the right coronary artery (RCA), which arises from the right coronary sinus of the aorta. The division creates the conic artery, which provides blood flow to the right ventricular outflow tract. The second branch from the RCA supplies the sinus node (SA). The RCA then gives off branches (AM) that supply blood to the right ventricle and the main branch goes to the atrioventricular groove and divides into the posterior interventricular artery (PDA) and posterolateral arterial branches. (2)\nThe distal right coronary artery supplies a branch that feeds the atrioventricular (AV) node in 90% of patients, with a branch of the circumflex supplying blood to the remaining patients. The PDA supplies the inferior wall of both ventricles and is a terminal branch of the RCA in 85% of patients but may originate from the left coronary artery in 15% of the population.\nThe main impact of RV ischemia and infarction is due to reduced RV contractility. This leads to reduced blood flow from the venous system to the lungs and ultimately the left heart. The clinical signs of this are increased right-sided cardiac pressure, increased pulmonary artery (PA) systolic pressure, and decreased left ventricular preload. Symptoms may include peripheral edema, especially varicose veins, hypoxemia, and hypotension.\nIn addition, when the right ventricle dilates, the movement and function of the interventricular septum are changed. Depending on the area of ​​infarction, symptoms may include marked hypotension and heart failure. If the septum shifts to the left during diastole, it impedes left ventricular filling and results in decreased cardiac output. This is called loss of interdependence between the two ventricles.\n\nSigns of right ventricular myocardial infarction\nPatients may experience some symptoms such as: (3)\nChest pain with or without spasms, shortness of breath, nausea and dizziness;; Arrhythmia ranging from bradycardia to complete heart block;; Hypotension;; Acute peripheral arterial edema and cone venous distension;; Right ventricular dysfunction with symptoms of varicose veins, clear lungs, and hypotension;; A systolic murmur heard over the left lower parasternal part may indicate tricuspid regurgitation. However this does not always appear;; The third and/or fourth heart sound produced by a right ventricular myocardial infarction is heard at the left lower sternal border. However, this symptom is rare.\nMore than 30% of patients with inferior myocardial infarction have right ventricular infarction. But only 10% of cases have significant hemodynamic effects due to right ventricular dysfunction.\n\nComplications of right ventricular myocardial infarction\nSequelae of the disease vary widely, from no hemodynamic impact to severe hypotension and cardiogenic shock depending on the degree of right ventricular ischemia. (4)\n\nDiagnostic method\nDiagnosis of right ventricular myocardial infarction (RVMI) includes the following methods.\n1. Clinical and paraclinical examination\nIt is important to consider the diagnosis of right ventricular infarction, especially when an inferior myocardial infarction is present. The typical triad of symptoms observed on examination is hypotension occurring with jugular venous dilation and clear lung auscultation. Left ventricular (LV) function is still contracted.\nTricuspid regurgitation murmur, Kussmaul sign, and paradoxical pulse are signs of significant hemodynamic compromise due to RV ischemia. In some cases, these symptoms are not present upon admission and are not seen until diuretics or nitrates are administered.\n2. Two-dimensional echocardiography\nThis technique can demonstrate right ventricular (RV) dilation with impaired systolic function and RV free wall dyskinesia with paradoxical interventricular septal motion. Doppler examination of specific valvular regurgitation flows can add detailed hemodynamic information and confirm the diagnosis of RV involvement, especially in cases where two-dimensional imaging is technically inadequate. art.\nThese noninvasive techniques can be used to detect right ventricular dysfunction. Dilated right ventricle with hypokinesis, dyskinesia or dyskinesia of its free wall associated with right ventricular ejection fraction and normal or only mildly impaired left ventricular ejection fraction are signs right ventricular myocardial infarction (RVMI).\n3. Check hemodynamics\nHemodynamic testing using right heart catheterization may reveal a disproportionate increase in right-sided filling pressure relative to left-sided filling pressure. Generally accepted criteria for hemodynamically significant RVMI include right atrial pressure (RAP) >10 mmHg, RAP to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) ratio >0.8, or RAP < 5mmHg compared to PCWP. However, with concomitant and significant left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, the close relationship between RAP and PCWP is not preserved, although RAP will continue to be elevated.\n4. Electrocardiogram (ECG)\nThis is the first diagnostic test performed in patients with chest pain. If the left ventricle is involved, there may be evidence of ischemia/infarction in inferior leads II, III, and the AVF. Asymmetric ST elevation in leads III>II is prognostic for right ventricular myocardial infarction and requires further investigation.\nST elevation in lead V1 is also highly suspicious for right ventricular myocardial infarction and is even more specific when combined with ST depression in lead V2. In general, the conventional left chest electrocardiogram is a poor indicator of ischemia/infarction at the right cardiac location.\nIf right-sided dysfunction is suspected, right chest ECG leads have higher sensitivity and specificity, with ST elevation in V4R >1.0mm having 100% sensitivity, 87% specificity and predictive accuracy. guess 92%. Conduction abnormalities such as right bundle branch block, bradycardia, or complete heart block may also be present on the electrocardiogram but may also be nonspecific.\n5. Cardiac enzyme test\nCardiac enzymes will increase in the case of right ventricular myocardial infarction, similar to left ventricular myocardial infarction. However, when distinguishing between hemodynamically significant pulmonary embolism (PE) and RVMI, the picture is unclear, as both troponin-I and CK-MB levels may be elevated in a small number of cases of significant PE. .\n6. Coronary angiography and ventriculography\nThis is the gold standard for diagnosing the condition. Coronary angiography usually shows right coronary artery (RCA) occlusion anterior to the right ventricular bifurcation, and more proximal occlusion often suggests more extensive necrosis of the posterior wall and possibly the anterior wall of the RV myocardium.\nIn patients with left coronary artery predominance, circumflex artery occlusion (LCX) may also be found. Although uncommon, right ventricular myocardial infarction can result from occlusion of the anterior interventricular artery.\nCoronary angiography is one of the methods to diagnose right ventricular myocardial infarction.\n7. Chest X-ray\nThis method also has limitations in specificity and diagnostic ability. There may be findings of an enlarged cardiac silhouette, dilated inferior or superior vena cava, and bright lung fields. The presence or absence of pulmonary edema may be helpful in determining the presence or extent of concomitant left ventricular dysfunction or further evaluating the presence of pulmonary embolism (PE).\n8. Differential diagnosis\nSymptoms of right ventricular myocardial infarction can also be seen in other diseases. Therefore, excluding the following pathologies also contributes to the correct diagnosis of the disease.\nAcute aortic dissection; Acute cholecystitis; Acute gastritis; Acute mitral regurgitation; Acute pericarditis; Anxiety disorders; Aortic stenosis; Asthma; Biliary tract disease\n\nTreatment of right ventricular myocardial infarction\nImpaired right heart function, if clinically significant, can lead to decreased left ventricular preload, decreased cardiac output, and ultimately systemic hypotension. Some treatments for right ventricular myocardial infarction include:\nInternally medical treatment\n1. Infusion\nUse an infusion of approximately 500 ml of solution to evaluate and monitor hemodynamic improvement or worsening hemodynamic changes.\n2. Nitrate medicine\nNitrate drugs are often used to treat myocardial infarction. However, this medication can cause side effects that make right ventricular dysfunction and systemic hypotension more severe. Therefore, the doctor will evaluate the patient's condition to see if treatment with this drug is recommended or not, and if so, careful monitoring is needed.\n3. Other drugs\nDobutamine: Use of inotropes can help improve myocardial contractility in cases of suboptimal reduction. The drug also helps improve cardiac index and cardiac output of the right ventricle.; Inhaled nitric oxide combined with dobutamine: The combination of inhaled nitric oxide with dobutamine additionally helps reduce pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), thereby reducing pressure on the right ventricle and myocardial activity. ; Milrinone: This is a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor that may improve right ventricular dysfunction. However, your doctor will consider the benefits and risks before using the drug because the drug can worsen systemic hypotension.; Levosimendan: The drug can help increase cardiac contractility by increasing the sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to intracellular calcium without increasing calcium concentration, thereby improving right ventricular function.\n4. Coronary intervention\nSimilar to the treatment of left ventricular myocardial infarction, the time to revascularize the right ventricular artery is the main factor determining the patient's survival and recovery. Percutaneous coronary intervention is the optimal choice to help revascularize clogged arteries and improve blood flow to the right heart.\n\nPrognosis of right ventricular myocardial infarction\nThe short-term prognosis of patients with right ventricular myocardial infarction is worse than that of left ventricular myocardial infarction. Morbidity and mortality during hospitalization both increased. This is due to complications arising from right ventricular myocardial infarction, which may require additional procedures (ICD placement, VAD placement, arrhythmia intervention). The long-term prognosis of patients discharged from the hospital after treatment for right ventricular myocardial infarction is similar to that of patients with left ventricular myocardial infarction.\nPrognosis is based on several factors. Inferior myocardial infarction complicated by RVMI has a worse prognosis than other cases. If the patient does not have right ventricular (RV) failure, the mortality rate within 30 days of hospitalization is 4.4% with thrombolytic therapy and 3.2% with percutaneous intervention (PCI). This rate increased to 13% for thrombolysis and 8.3% for PCI in patients with RV failure. In patients with cardiogenic shock, mortality increases to 100% with thrombolysis and 44% with PCI.\nDaily exercise helps prevent the risk of cardiovascular disease\nThe diagnosis and treatment of right ventricular myocardial infarction is very complex, requiring the coordination of a team of cardiac surgeons, interventional vascular physicians, cardiologists, intensivists, and anesthesiologists. . Most patients with right ventricular myocardial infarction have risk factors for coronary artery disease. Patients need to control their weight, quit smoking, exercise regularly, take medication as prescribed, and control blood fat. Patients need to have follow-up appointments to closely monitor their health, detect abnormalities early and intervene promptly.",

In patients with cardiogenic shock, mortality increases to 100% with thrombolysis and 44% with PCI.\nDaily exercise helps prevent the risk of cardiovascular disease\nThe diagnosis and treatment of right ventricular myocardial infarction is very complex, requiring the coordination of a team of cardiac surgeons, interventional vascular physicians, cardiologists, intensivists, and anesthesiologists. . Most patients with right ventricular myocardial infarction have risk factors for coronary artery disease. Patients need to control their weight, quit smoking, exercise regularly, take medication as prescribed, and control blood fat. Patients need to have follow-up appointments to closely monitor their health, detect abnormalities early and intervene promptly."
