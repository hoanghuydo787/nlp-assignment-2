    "content": "Moles: Causes, formation mechanism and classification\n\nAlmost everyone has moles in varying numbers. This condition is not a dangerous problem unless the mole changes abnormally.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are moles?\nMoles (also known as moles) are small dark spots (mostly brown or black), round or oval, appearing singly or in groups of many adjacent spots on the skin. Moles can be found anywhere on the body such as the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, scalp, nails, eyes or even on the genitals. The lifespan of moles can last up to 50 years. (first)\nMost moles appear when we are children and usually form in the first 25 - 30 years of life. On average, each adult has 10 - 40 moles. Moles often change slowly in shape and number, may change color slightly or become raised or sometimes grow hair. Moles may also fade and disappear later.\nMoles can appear singly or in clusters of many adjacent moles\n\nMechanism of mole formation\nIn the three layers of skin structure (epidermis, dermis and hypodermis), moles often form in the lower part of the epidermis. So how are moles formed? Moles are the result when pigment-producing cells – called melanocytes (which produce melanin to form skin and hair color) – grow and are unevenly distributed on the skin.\n\nCauses of moles\nThe cause of moles comes from melanocytes gathering in clusters instead of spreading on the skin. Moles can become darker when exposed to sunlight, during puberty or during pregnancy due to hormonal changes. In addition, you can also get new moles if you do not know how to protect your skin from the effects of the sun's UV rays.\n\nTypes of moles\nMoles are often divided into 3 types:\nCommon moles: Among all types of moles, this is the most common type of mole, most of which are small, dark and benign. Moles will normally have a clear, regular edge; Congenital moles: These are moles discovered at birth, also known as birthmarks. 1 in 100 people have congenital moles. This type of mole has a greater risk of developing into melanoma than moles that appear after birth. If the mole diameter is larger than 8mm, the risk of cancer increases; Dysplastic moles: Also known as atypical moles. This type of mole is usually larger than 5mm with blurred/pale borders, irregular shape and uneven color and is often hereditary. The more dysplastic moles a person has, the greater the risk of melanoma and skin cancer.\nAmong the types of moles, dysplastic moles are the type that are at risk of forming melanoma\n\nSigns of moles\nBenign and malignant moles have different characteristics; There are a number of identifying signs that can be easily observed with the naked eye.\n1. Benign moles\nThe most familiar sign of a benign mole is a small brown spot. There are also other features such as:\nColor and texture: Can be brown, black, blue, red or pink. uniform color. Smooth, flat or slightly raised surface; Shape: Most are round or oval, with clear edges; Size: Usually less than 6mm in diameter. Congenital moles can be larger than normal, covering part of the face, body or limbs\n2. Malignant moles\nMoles can be a sign of skin cancer with abnormalities in shape (unclear borders), irregular color, rapid enlargement or rapid elevation causing ulceration. Some special locations can also cause moles to become cancerous such as: areas exposed to light (face, neck, chest...) or areas that are rubbed a lot such as the scalp (due to brushing), clothes folds...\nThe common location of the tumor in men is on the chest and back (due to being naked); In women, it is the neck (because the shirt has no collar). In particular, malignant Melanoma is one of the most common types of cancer in young women.\nSome notes below will help you grasp the warning signs of malignant moles. If you find that you are experiencing one or more of the symptoms, you should have a dermatological examination as soon as possible.\nTime of appearance: Moles first appear after age 25; Asymmetrical shape, the two halves of the mole are not the same/don't match each other; Has irregular borders; the edges are notched or jagged like a scalloped shape; The color of the mole changes or has many colors or uneven colors; The diameter of the mole is large, about 6mm or more; Noticing changes in mole size, color, shape, and elevation; Moles have additional symptoms such as itching, burning pain, bleeding, oozing, peeling, scabbing or suddenly softening; Moles with hair lose all their hair\nIn addition, it is necessary to distinguish moles that are not brown spots around the eyes, cheeks or nose (often called flesh moles). These brown spots are actually dermatophytosis - a type of seborrheic keratosis and do not originate from clusters of pigment-forming cells like moles. “Flesh moles” have no risk of developing into skin cancer and can be treated if you feel they are affected aesthetically.\nMoles are also easily confused with freckles. Freckles are also small brown spots that often appear on the face, neck, chest and arms but do not pose a threat to health. Freckles are often easily seen in hot summers in people with fair skin.\nBenign moles are usually uniform in color, have clear borders, and are symmetrical on both sides\n\nComplications of moles\nMoles usually do not cause many complications. Melanoma is the biggest potential risk of moles.\nIn fact, moles themselves are not a sign of skin cancer, but dysplastic mole cells can mutate into melanocytes under certain conditions.\nPeople with many moles (10 or more), especially if they are dysplastic moles, the risk of developing skin-related diseases - specifically skin cancer - also increases many times. The probability of the disease will also increase if other skin cancer risk factors are combined such as having a family history of skin cancer, frequent long exposure to the sun or people with fair skin, etc.\nIn addition, if the mole is located in a vulnerable location such as being susceptible to collisions or scratches, you need to pay attention to avoid letting the mole bleed to limit the risk of infection. Infected moles can cause pain, bleeding, discharge or fever.\n\nDiagnosis of moles\nYour doctor can diagnose moles by direct observation/dermatoscopy. During a dermatological examination, your entire body will be examined.\nAccording to the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the 7-point checklist for assessing moles includes the following:\nDoes the mole cause pain, itching or any strange sensation?; Are moles evenly colored?; Does the mole have an unusual shape? Does the size of the mole change?; Is the mole diameter larger than 7mm?; Does the mole bleed?; Is the mole red, swollen, or inflamed?\nIf the mole has only mild changes, you will need to monitor it for a few weeks after having a clinical photo taken and the mole size measured. If a mole is suspected to be at high risk of cancer, the doctor will perform a biopsy immediately. If the test results are suspicious of melanoma, you will need to have additional tests to determine whether the cancer has metastasized.\nWe should self-examine our whole body skin at least every 3-4 months. If you discover any new or changing moles, you should get it checked out early.\nSkin examination is a method that helps doctors check more specifically about the type of mole you have\n\nHow to remove moles?\nMost moles do not require treatment. However, if you don't feel confident, you can use concealer to temporarily \"hide\" your blemishes. For moles that are suspected of being bad or you want to remove them more completely, you can consider mole removal.\nMole removal is usually performed in a short time and can be treated on an outpatient basis. The doctor will locally anesthetize the area around the mole, then use professional medical tools to \"remove\" the mole. Mole removal can leave small scars. For people with sensitive skin, there is also the possibility of keloid scars or changes in skin pigmentation at the cut.; Removal techniques will depend on the size of the mole, the degree of growth of the mole to the surface of the skin or spread to other parts of the body. If the cancer has spread to the blood or lymphatic system and formed tumors in other areas, the patient will need other more intensive treatments. After mole removal, you need to pay attention to keeping the wound clean and use painkillers if necessary and should see a doctor soon if the wound is red, swollen, painful, exuding fluid or has a bad smell.; If after removing the mole it still reappears, you need to see a specialist soon because this is also a sign that it may be malignant.\nNote: Never remove moles yourself at home. Shaving or removing moles yourself has a high risk of harm, not only increasing the possibility of scarring but also making the skin susceptible to infection. More dangerous for malignant moles can also spread to surrounding skin.\n\nPrevent moles\nThe number of moles is determined by genetics - with this natural development, there is no way to help you prevent moles. However, you can still limit the darkening of the mole as well as the appearance of new moles by protecting your skin from the sun - especially during adolescence. (2)\nAvoid going out during intense sunlight: Limit outdoor activities from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. because this is when there are the most ultraviolet rays from the sun; even in cool weather; Use sunscreen: According to AAD - American Academy of Dermatology, you should use sunscreen with an SPF index of at least 30; Use about 30 minutes before going out and reapply every 2 hours.; Don't ignore protective gear: Wide-brimmed hats, sunglasses, long-sleeved clothes and other protective items will help you effectively prevent UV rays from damaging your skin.\n\nFrequently asked questions about moles\n1. Who is susceptible to moles?\nMoles are hereditary, so if someone in your family has moles, there is a high chance that you will also have moles. In addition, people who are regularly exposed to the sun also have a high risk of new moles appearing.\n2. Can new moles be prevented?\nYou can prevent new moles as well as prevent old moles from getting darker if you know how to protect your skin from the sun's UV rays.\n3. Should moles be removed?\nWhether or not you should remove moles depends on personal beauty desires as well as on the advice of a dermatologist if you suspect the mole is at risk of cancer.\n4. When is it necessary to remove moles?\nIf you feel that the mole affects your aesthetics or it is a mole with a risk of malignancy, you can have it removed. It is important to remove moles at medical facilities with specialized doctors; You should not bleach at home as it is less effective and carries a risk of infection.\n5. Where should I be examined if I have an abnormal mole?\nLarge hospitals with specialized dermatology departments and dermatology clinics with experienced doctors are places where you can visit if you feel unusual in your mole.\nAccording to Dr. Dang Thi Ngoc Bich, moles are not a serious health concern. However, do not ignore the changes in moles and limit the factors that cause moles to become damaged and infected.\nDr. Dang Thi Ngoc Bich is the person who laid the first brick, building and promoting the work of both skin medical examination and treatment and skin aesthetics at Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City. In particular, Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City has the advantage of modern machinery and equipment, a team of highly skilled doctors and technicians, and a convenient location for people to examine skin diseases and skin aesthetics. safe and effective.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with a Dermatologist at Tam Anh General Hospital System, you can choose from the following options:\nContact hotline 0287 102 6789 (HCMC) or 024 3872 3872 (Hanoi) to register for a private examination with a specialist.; Register for an appointment at the link: https://tamanhhospital.vn/danh-cho-khach-hang/dat-lich-kham/; Send a message on Tam Anh General Hospital Fanpage.; Text message via Zalo OA of Tam Anh General Hospital.\nThrough the article, people have learned more about the types of moles. They often have different characteristics, are not contagious, are not painful, and are mostly harmless. A mole can last up to 50 years. However, see a dermatologist if you suspect that your mole is unusual.",
