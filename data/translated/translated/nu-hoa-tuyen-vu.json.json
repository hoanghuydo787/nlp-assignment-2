This is not a serious disease, does not pose much danger to health, but it greatly affects psychology, making men feel less confident in life. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to understand the signs and causes of the disease to examine and take preventive measures early.\n\nWhat is gynecomastia?\nGynecomastia is an increase in the amount of breast tissue in men, caused by an imbalance between the hormones estrogen and testosterone. This condition can occur in one or both breasts, sometimes unevenly.\nGynecomastia is not a normal increase in fatty tissue in the mammary gland (also known as pseudogynecomastia).\n\nCauses of gynecomastia in men\nAccording to experts, hormonal imbalance is the main cause of gynecomastia in men. Hormonal imbalance in men can be due to the following reasons:\n1. Natural hormonal changes\nIn the male body there is both the male sex hormone testosterone and the female sex hormone estrogen. Testosterone controls male characteristics such as muscle mass and body hair. Meanwhile, estrogen controls the development of mammary glands. When estrogen levels in the male body are too high or imbalanced with testosterone levels, it can cause gynecomastia. This condition usually occurs in the following 3 stages:\nNewborn: More than 50% of male newborns have gynecomastia due to the influence of estrogen from the mother. However, this condition will disappear within 2-3 weeks after giving birth.; Puberty: This is a fairly common condition, due to hormonal imbalance during puberty. However, in most cases, the condition will disappear after six months to two years without treatment.; Adulthood: About 24 - 65% of men aged 50 - 80 years old have gynecomastia.\nNatural hormonal changes can cause gynecomastia in older men\n2. Medicine\nSome medications can cause gynecomastia such as:\nAnti-androgen drugs: Treat prostate enlargement, prostate cancer and some other conditions such as flutamide, finasteride (Proscar, Propecia) and spironolactone (Aldactone, Carospir).; Anabolic and androgenic steroids: Treatment of hormonal deficiencies, delayed puberty or muscle loss due to other diseases.; AIDS medications: The estrogen-like properties of some HIV medications can cause gynecomastia such as Efavirenz (Sustiva).; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications containing amphetamine such as Adderall.; Cardiovascular medications: such as digoxin (Lanoxin) and calcium channel blockers\nStomach emptying medications: such as metoclopramide (Reglan)\nStomach ulcer medications: such as cimetidine (Tagamet HB); Anti-anxiety medications: such as diazepam (Valium); Tricyclic antidepressants; Antibiotics; Cancer medicine\n3. Use of alcohol and drugs\nAlcohol abuse; Using anabolic steroids to increase muscle mass and improve athletic performance and some narcotics such as amphetamine, marijuana, heroin, and methadone have been determined to cause gynecomastia in men.\n4. Pathology\nSome diseases can cause gynecomastia in men due to affecting hormonal balance such as:\nHypogonadism: Klinefelter syndrome or hypopituitarism can reduce testosterone production in men, thereby causing gynecomastia; Aging: Hormonal changes that occur with aging can cause gynecomastia, especially in overweight men.; Tumors: Tumors involving the testicles, adrenal glands or pituitary gland can produce hormones that change the male-female hormone balance.; Hyperthyroidism: The thyroid gland produces too much of the hormone thyroxine.; Kidney failure: About half of people treated with dialysis develop gynecomastia due to hormonal changes.; Liver failure and cirrhosis: Changes in hormone levels related to liver problems and medications to treat cirrhosis have been linked to gynecomastia.; Malnutrition: When the body is not provided with adequate nutrients, testosterone levels will decrease while estrogen levels remain the same, thereby causing hormonal imbalance. However, gynecomastia can also occur when normal nutrition returns.; Herbal: Some vegetable oils such as tea or lavender, used in shampoos, soaps, and lotions are believed to be linked to gynecomastia due to their weak estrogenic activity. go out.\n\nSigns of gynecomastia in men\nWhen suffering from gynecomastia, men may have some clinical manifestations such as:\nBreasts are larger than normal; Chest pain, this condition is common in adolescents; Swelling of breast tissue; Breasts are painful to touch; Nipples are sensitive when rubbed against clothes\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nSee a specialist for early examination and treatment if you have one of the following symptoms:\nBreast swelling; Feeling pain in one or both breasts; Nipple discharge\n\nWho is at high risk of gynecomastia?\nNewborn boys, boys in puberty (12 - 16 years old) and older men are susceptible to gynecomastia due to natural changes in hormone levels in the body and a number of factors. other cause.\n\nDiagnosis of gynecomastia in men\nTo accurately determine the condition of gynecomastia in men, the doctor will first conduct a clinical examination to carefully evaluate the patient's breast tissue, abdomen and genitals. Then, the doctor will prescribe the patient to undergo a number of tests to determine the possible cause of gynecomastia, screen for breast cancer, and rule out conditions that can cause symptoms similar to those of women. gynecomastia (pseudogynecomastia, breast cancer, breast abscess), including:\nBlood tests; Mammography (breast X-ray); Computed tomography (CT); Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Testicular ultrasound; Tissue biopsy\nBlood tests can help diagnose gynecomastia in men\n\nHow to treat gynecomastia?\nCurrently, gynecomastia treatment depends on each case such as:\nAdolescents with gynecomastia have no obvious cause. In addition to normal hormonal changes during puberty, their doctor may recommend regular follow-up examinations every 3 to 6 months to see if the condition occurs naturally. improve or not. Because most cases of gynecomastia in adolescents usually disappear without treatment within two years.\nIn cases where men use drugs that cause gynecomastia, or have gynecomastia due to underlying diseases such as hypogonadism, malnutrition, cirrhosis, etc., the cause only needs to be eliminated.\nSpecific treatment with medication or surgery is considered when the condition does not improve on its own, causes pain or discomfort, or affects psychology.\nDrug treatment: Drugs used to treat breast cancer and other diseases may be helpful for some men with gynecomastia such as Tamoxifen, an aromatase inhibitor. Although these medications have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), they have not been specifically approved for use in people with gynecomastia.; Surgery: In cases where the mammary glands are getting larger and causing discomfort even after drug treatment or initial monitoring, the doctor may advise the patient to undergo liposuction surgery to remove breast fat or segmental surgery. subcutaneous embolization to remove mammary tissue.\n\nHow to prevent gynecomastia\nTo prevent gynecomastia, men need to pay attention to the following issues:\nLimit alcohol use; Regularly practice sports; Limit consumption of estrogen-rich foods such as soybeans, flaxseeds, nuts, etc.; Avoid using medications containing the hormone estrogen; Follow-up appointments as scheduled to monitor symptoms when diagnosed with gynecomastia. Use medication as prescribed by a specialist. Do not stop taking medication on your own.\nGynecomastia is a benign disease, not life-threatening, but that does not mean you can be subjective, because men with gynecomastia have a risk of breast cancer ten times higher than others. Normal. Therefore, when you detect abnormal signs in the mammary glands, you should go to a specialized medical facility for examination and appropriate treatment.",
