    "content": "What is a stealth omicron? Symptoms and diagnostic methods\n\nAppearing since the end of 2019, the Corona virus has continuously mutated, leading to many new variants such as: Delta, Omicron BA.1, Omicron BA.2 (stealth Omicron),... Some variants are easily spread. faster and faster than other variants, causing more Covid-19 infections every day. Even though vaccines are prevented, later strains also cause less serious disease, but the rapidly increasing number of infections is also putting pressure on the health system.\nExpert advice on articles: Doctor Pham Manh Hoan - Expert advisor to Tam Anh General Hospital.\n\nWhat is a stealth omicron?\nStealth variant is the name of the BA.2 sub-variant of the Omicron variant, which is causing the latest wave of infections. It is called \"stealth\" because this strain does not have the characteristic mutations of Omicron.\n\nSituation of the \"stealth\" Omicron variant in the world\nSub-variant BA.2 was discovered by scientists in early 2022. This variant is causing ⅓ of new Covid-19 infections globally. More than 50 US states have recorded the spread of this stealthy Omicron BA.2 strain.\nWithin 2 months, Omicron stealth version was recorded appearing in 92 countries around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) also recognized stealthy Omicron as the dominant variant in 18 countries.\nThe Omicron BA.2 variant was reported to appear in Denmark in February 2022 when it accounted for 69% of people infected with Covid-19 in the country. Also in February, Omicron was also discovered to become the dominant form in Africa and then in early March, CDC discovered the stealth Omicron sub-variant accounted for 11.6% of SARS-CoV- variants. 2 is circulating in the United States.\n\nSymptoms of “invisible” Omicron\nResearch by Danish and South African scientists shows that the hospitalization rate due to the stealth Omicron variant is no higher than that of the original Omicron variant. Most cases have mild symptoms, some people feel like they have the flu. If people get enough doses of Covid-19 vaccine, they will have a low risk of severe progression.\nThe stealthy Omircon strain causes symptoms of mild fever, cough, and body aches.\nResearchers at Denmark's Serum Institute say people who have been infected with the \"original\" Delta or Omicron variants can be reinfected with the secondary variant. Researching 140,000 genomes from November 2021 to mid-February 2022, scientists found 263 cases of reinfection, including 190 cases of stealth Omicron infection, of which 140 cases were after Delta infection and 47 infection after original Omicron infection. The cases of reinfection were all mild, with no cases becoming severe enough to require hospitalization or death.\n\nHow is the \"invisible\" Omicron different from the original variant?\nInitial studies show that stealth Omicron is up to 30% more infectious than the original Omicron variant (strains BA.1 and BA.1.1). A study by Japanese scientists concluded that invisible Omicron can cause more serious disease risks than the original Omicron. However, records in Denmark show that the hospitalization rate due to the BA.2 variant is equivalent to the original Omicron, milder than the Delta variant. The Public Health Agency of Africa also determined that BA.2 does not cause more severe disease than BA.1.\nAccording to WHO, BA.2 differs from BA.1 in its gene sequence, including amino acid differences in the mutant protein and other proteins. Specifically, BA.2 has a growth advantage and is easier to transmit than BA.1. However, this difference is not too much compared to the difference between BA.1 and Delta strain.\n\nStealth Omicron diagnostic method\nStealth Omicron spreads quickly, the symptoms are mostly mild like the flu but there are still differences so you can suspect early such as: burning pain and dry thirst in the throat, fatigue, body aches , sneezing, mild fever, etc. Based on suspected symptoms, you continue to use PCR testing, rapid testing to diagnose and protect your health.\nPCR method\nLike other Covid-19 variants, rapid tests and PCR tests are two typical methods to determine whether or not you are positive for the Omicron strain.\nPCR test is a test performed using Real-time technique. Medical staff will use a stick to take nasopharyngeal fluid from the body of a person suspected of being infected, then put it into the testing system to analyze and find the gene segment of the corona virus, thereby determining whether the test sample is positive or negative. calculated with Covid-19. Currently, Tam Anh General Hospital uses the most modern Alinity M testing system from the US to accurately diagnose the disease-causing virus using PCR technique and give results in less than 6 hours.\nPCR testing to determine Covid-19 has a high price and is used at medical facilities equipped with testing machines. This method takes a lot of time for the machine to analyze and produce accurate results.\nWhy can't the quick test detect the \"invisible\" Omicron?\nWhile PCR has a higher cost and is performed in medical facilities, rapid tests are widely used for everyone, anyone can check for themselves to determine whether they are infected or not. Although the level of accuracy is not as high as the PCR method, this is a popular way to help thousands of people know whether or not they are infected with Covid-19 in a short time and have appropriate treatment.\nIt is difficult to detect the invisible Omicron strain with a quick test kit.\nHowever, with the invisible Omicron variant, many people report that they cannot test positive even though they have all the symptoms of the disease such as: mild fever, sneezing, cough, muscle aches, etc. Medical experts say that in case you have all the symptoms of Omicron infection but still get a negative rapid test result due to many reasons.\nFirst, maybe you tested in the early days of exposure to the Omicron variant, so the results were still negative.\nSecond, during the process of performing a quick test, you did something wrong, leading to erroneous results. After a quick test, test results should be read after 15 to 30 minutes (depending on the manufacturer's instructions) to ensure accuracy.\nThird, the market has many types of test kits with uneven levels of sensitivity and specificity. Fake and poor quality kits can give unreliable results. Even some old test kits are no longer suitable for this variant, so they do not give correct results.\n\nPrevention of Omicron BA.2 variant\nThe main way to prevent Covid-19 is to get enough vaccine doses and do 5K as recommended by the Ministry of Health. Below are 3 very important Covid-19 prevention measures.\nFace mask\nLike other variants, preventing the invisible Omicron variant by wearing masks properly is an easy to implement measure that brings certain effectiveness. Masks help prevent droplets and limit the infection process during daily contact and communication. At the same time, wearing a mask regularly also helps protect you from common flu viruses, avoiding diseases: colds, runny nose, cough, sore throat,...\nTaking good preventive measures will help protect you from post-Covid-19 lung damage.\nVaccine\nVaccines are the leading measure to prevent the stealth Omicron variant as well as other variants of Covid-19. Vaccinating with a full dose of Covid-19 vaccine will help the body produce antibodies against the attack of coronavirus, reducing the risk of hospitalization.\nReality shows that cases of Covid-19 that receive the full dose of vaccine often have mild symptoms, less severe progression, and recover quickly. Even for the invisible Omicron variant, if vaccinated, people infected with Covid-19 will only feel like they have a mild cold and can still live and work normally.\nEvusheld injection – monoclonal antibody for Covid-19 prevention\nTam Anh General Hospital System pioneered in bringing AstraZeneca's Evusheld - the world's first licensed Covid-19 preventive monoclonal antibody to Vietnam, promptly protecting vulnerable groups against Covid-19.\nFor the first time, high-risk groups of people such as: people with moderate to severe immunodeficiency, people who cannot be vaccinated or cannot produce enough antibodies to prevent Covid-19 even though they have been vaccinated... have a chance. Use prophylactic monoclonal antibodies for Covid-19, to quickly provide protection, reduce hospitalization and death.\nCurrently, AstraZeneca's first monoclonal antibody Evusheld for Covid-19 prevention has been licensed in the world. Tam Anh General Hospital system pioneered bringing Evusheld monoclonal antibodies to Vietnam, helping groups of people who cannot be vaccinated have the opportunity to prevent and reduce the risk of hospitalization, especially with variants of Covid 19 such as Delta, Omicron and Omicron stealth.",
