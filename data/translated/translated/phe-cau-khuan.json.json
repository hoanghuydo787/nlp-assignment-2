    "content": "What disease does pneumococcus cause: Causes, treatment and prevention\n\nPneumococcus can lead to many serious, life-threatening diseases such as meningitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, otitis media, sepsis... (diseases caused by pneumococcal bacteria). Therefore, it is necessary to clearly understand the causes and symptoms to have effective treatment and prevention. This article is expertly advised by Master, Resident Doctor Dang Thanh Do - Department of Respiratory Medicine, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi.\n\nWhat is pneumococcus?\nPneumococcus is a bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae, commonly known as pneumococcus. This is a Gram-positive bacteria belonging to the genus Streptococcus. There are many different strains of pneumococcus bacteria that will cause different diseases. Pneumococcus resides mainly in the nose, throat and airways of healthy people and usually does not cause disease, called healthy carriers. (first)\nIn sensitive subjects such as young children, the elderly, especially people with weakened immune systems, pneumococcus can easily cause disease. Every year in the world, nearly half a million children die from diseases caused by pneumococcal bacteria. Children are the main group susceptible to the disease..\nPneumococcal disease is usually spread through the respiratory tract when coming into contact with someone carrying the bacteria through sneezing, coughing, vomiting... or sharing personal items.\nDiseases caused by pneumococcus are often spread through the respiratory tract.\n\nThe disease is caused by pneumococcal bacteria and has common symptoms\nPneumococcal bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae often causes many different pneumococcal infections, most commonly otitis media, sinusitis, severe and life-threatening infections such as lung infections causing pneumonia, blood infection, meningitis...\n1. Pneumonia\nOne of the main causes of pneumonia in children and people over 65 years old and people with weak immune systems is pneumococcal infection. Pneumonia is an infection in the lungs that causes damage to the air sacs on one or both sides of the lungs, causing inflammation. The disease progresses quickly and can lead to complications if not accurately diagnosed and treated promptly.\nSymptoms of pneumonia are usually high fever, chills, in some cases hypothermia, chest pain, difficulty breathing, cough with phlegm or blood...\n2. Otitis media\nThis is an ear infection. The common cause is due to an infection in the upper respiratory tract that is not treated completely or improperly, leading to otitis media. The disease is common in young children with a rate of up to 80%.\nSymptoms of the disease are usually high fever, fussiness, loss of appetite, loss of appetite, ear rubbing, diarrhea...\nFor adults, the disease can also appear with more obvious and recognizable symptoms such as ear pain, fever, hearing problems, irritability, fatigue, and nausea. If severe, there may be fluid flowing from the ear out.\n3. Meningitis\nMeningitis caused by infected pneumococcus is very difficult to detect. The disease leaves many serious sequelae for sufferers.\nWhen infected, symptoms are often headaches and vomiting. This symptom can easily be confused with gastrointestinal diseases. In addition, the disease also shows signs of high fever and headache that last for many hours, even days. People infected with meningitis are very sensitive to light, have stiff neck, loss of appetite, disturbance of consciousness, drowsiness and restlessness. Meningitis caused by pneumococcal infection, if not detected and treated properly, can leave neurological sequelae.\n4. Sepsis in HIV infected people\nPeople with weakened immune systems (for example, people infected with HIV) are more susceptible to many diseases than normal people, including sepsis caused by pneumococcus.\nPneumococcal bacteria enter the bloodstream and cause many symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, drowsiness, and possibly fatal septic shock.\nIn addition to the above diseases, pneumococcus also causes many other diseases such as conjunctivitis, osteomyelitis, cellulitis, acute sinusitis, pericarditis...\nResident MSc Dang Thanh Do advises patients on diseases caused by pneumococcal bacteria. Photo: Tam Anh General Hospital\n\nSubjects susceptible to disease caused by pneumococcal bacteria\nChildren are susceptible to pneumococcal infections and are also severely affected. (3)\nMeningitis caused by pneumococcus is a worrying disease in children with 83% of cases occurring in children under 2 years old. The disease has a high mortality rate and leaves many serious sequelae, especially in developed countries in Asia and Africa. The risk of death in these countries is often over 50% of the total number of infected children. About 30 - 50% of the remaining people can survive but suffer sequelae such as disability, blindness, deafness, epilepsy, paralysis, developmental delay, memory loss, prolonged headaches...\nBesides meningitis, children also often suffer from otitis media caused by pneumococcal bacteria. According to statistics, up to 80% of children under 3 years old have at least one case of otitis media, especially children under 1 year old. More than 1/3 of them have repeated infections over a long period of time. The disease is easily transmitted from one child to another.\nSepsis (pneumococcal infection in the blood) is quite dangerous in cases with other underlying diseases, with a mortality rate of about 20%.\nPneumonia is the most common serious infection caused by pneumococcus; It manifests as bronchopneumonia or lobar pneumonia. Pneumococcus is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in all ages.\n\nTransmission routes and complications of pneumococcal disease\nStreptococcus pneumoniae is found in the nose and throat of 5 - 10% of healthy adults and 20 - 40% of healthy children. Certain environments such as military barracks or day care centers will find higher numbers of pneumococcus. Pneumococci attach to nasopharyngeal cells through bacterial surface adhesion. Localization can become infectious when microorganisms are introduced into areas such as the Eustachian tube or nasal sinuses, causing otitis media or sinusitis. Pneumonia occurs if pneumococcus is inhaled into the lungs and is not eliminated.\nPneumococcus can also spread through the bloodstream causing septicemia, leading to meningitis, brain abscess, septic arthritis or osteomyelitis.\nPeople with congenital hemiplegia, spleen removal surgery, sickle cell disease... leading to infection, people with compromised immune systems... will be at higher risk of pneumococcal disease.\nPneumococcus causes many diseases in children and adults.\nMethods of diagnosing pneumococcal infection\nDepending on the severity of symptoms and the impact on parts of the body, the doctor may prescribe paraclinical examinations such as:\nComputed tomography or chest X-ray;; Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test;; Test sputum, blood, fluid taken from the lungs, joints, bones, around the heart or abscesses.\n\nMethods of treating diseases caused by pneumococcal bacteria\nDepending on the severity of the condition, appropriate treatment solutions will be provided. For mild pneumococcal infections: Using antibiotics is necessary in the treatment regimen. Which medicine to use and the dosage will be determined by the doctor after diagnosing the condition based on examination and test results.\nIn some cases of severe infection, doctors prescribe intravenous antibiotics. For more severe symptoms that can be life-threatening, oxygen therapy and many other forms of treatment are performed.\n\nHow to prevent pneumococcal infection\n1. Vaccines\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) encourages the inclusion of pneumococcal vaccine in national immunization programs. With the level of causing many dangerous diseases, preventing pneumococcal disease by early vaccination for children from 6 weeks of age is a way to significantly reduce the mortality rate, while also reducing costs and treatment time.\nIt is recommended that children from 5 weeks to 5 years of age be vaccinated against pneumococcal infection. This is a measure to minimize complications and reduce the use of antibiotics when not really necessary.\n2. Avoid exposure factors\nBefore and after eating or after contact with public surfaces, wash your hands with soap;; Cover your nose and mouth when coughing and sneezing;; Avoid smoking (active and passive);; Avoid contact with people at high risk of respiratory diseases;; When going to crowded places, you should wear a mask.\nDepartment of Respiratory Medicine, Tam Anh General Hospital System is the leading trusted examination address for patients infected with lung and respiratory diseases such as pneumococcus bacteria, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and bronchiectasis. bronchitis, asthma...\nThe hospital invests in a system of modern technological equipment such as the NBI narrow-band flexible bronchoscopy system, pleuroscopy system, high-tech X-ray machine, and 128-row CT scanner to help detect early detection of lung cancer, pleural cancer, bronchial and lung diseases; polysomnography system to diagnose the causes of snoring, insomnia and adjust the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, non-invasive ventilator to treat respiratory failure...\nTam Anh Hospital's Department of Respiratory Medicine coordinates closely with clinical and paraclinical departments to create a closed process, helping to accurately diagnose diseases caused by pneumococcus or pneumococcal bacteria, and develop treatment regimens. Reasonable treatment, shortening recovery time for patients.\nFor advice and to schedule an examination for respiratory diseases at the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Tam Anh General Hospital, you can contact: Hanoi: 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Bo De Ward, District 1. .Long Bien, Hanoi City Hotline: 024 3872 3872 – 024 7106 6858“>024 3872 3872 – 024 7106 6858 HCMC: 2B Pho Quang, Ward 2, Tan Binh District, Ho Chi Minh City Hotline: 0287 102 6789 – 093 180 6858“>0287 102 6789 – 093 180 6858 Fanpage: https://www.facebook.com/benhvientamanh",
