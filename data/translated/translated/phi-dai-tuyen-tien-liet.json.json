    "content": "Prostate enlargement: Causes, symptoms and prevention\n\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia or\nProstatic hypertrophy is a common disease in older men. Currently, with the development of diagnostic tools, more people with the disease are detected. In the world, about 60% of men aged 60 have benign prostatic hyperplasia. The frequency of the disease increases with age, so the number of people with the disease is increasing. The disease causes symptoms of urination disorders that affect quality of life.\n\nWhat is prostate enlargement?\nProstatic hypertrophy is a benign proliferation of a specific pathological tissue entity consisting of proliferation of stromal tissue and glandular mucosal cells, resulting in an enlarged prostate that can cause lower urinary tract obstruction. , then it is called an obstructive hump. (first)\nThe disease causes symptoms of urination disorders that negatively affect the patient's quality of life. Although it does not threaten the patient's life, the urination disorder will gradually get worse and require surgical intervention.\n\nCauses of prostate enlargement\nIn order for the treatment of  prostatic hypertrophy to be highly effective, Urology experts, Tam Anh General Hospital System recommend that you know the following causes of the disease:\nThe cause of prostate enlargement is still unclear. However, many studies confirm that it is related to aging factors and testicular abnormalities.\nAging: Throughout his life, a man produces both the male hormone testosterone and small amounts of the female hormone estrogen. As they age, blood levels of testosterone decrease, causing a higher proportion of estrogen. Studies show that the disease is at risk of being more severe when the ratio of the hormone estrogen is higher than testosterone.; Another theory stems from dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the body's natural male sex hormone that helps develop male characteristics. As men age, blood testosterone levels begin to decrease, but the hormone dihydrotestosterone still accumulates in the prostate. This can promote the cells of this gland to continue growing. Many studies have confirmed that men who are unable to produce dihydrotestosterone will not have prostate enlargement. (2)\nTesticles: Family history of prostate problems or testicular abnormalities can increase the risk of enlargement. Therefore, men who have had their testicles removed as children will not develop prostate enlargement.\n\nSymptoms of prostate enlargement\nDepending on the severity of the enlarged prostate, patients will have different symptoms. But in general, symptoms tend to get worse over time. Among them, Irritating Syndrome and Locked-in Syndrome are common such as: (3)\nUrinating frequently during the night; Urgent urination; Having to strain to urinate; Feeling of urgency to urinate; Weak or intermittent urine stream; Urinary incontinence; Sometimes urinary retention\nAdditionally, some less common symptoms include:\nUrinary tract infections; There is blood in the urine\nProstate size is not the determining factor in difficulty urinating, but depends on the hard core of the gland.\nBesides, urinary tract symptoms also come from many other causes such as: prostatitis, urethral stricture, bladder neck scarring due to previous surgery, bladder stones, kidney stones...\nIn addition, some other risk factors that cause a higher incidence of the disease include:\nAge: About 1/3 of men have moderate to severe symptoms in their 60s, and 1/2 of them will have prostatic hyperplasia by age 80. Prostate hyperplasia Rarely appears in men under 40 years of age.; Genetics: If a man has a blood relative such as a father or brother with prostate problems, the risk of having the disease will also be higher than other people.\n\nDiagnosis of prostate enlargement\nTo determine prostate enlargement, your doctor begins by examining you and asking your medical history. In particular, using a finger to examine through the anus to estimate the size and firmness of the prostate. (4)\nSome other methods are also indicated to support disease diagnosis as follows:\nUltrasound: is a common and easy method to perform. Ultrasound will show the shape, size and weight of the prostate, and measure the amount of urine remaining in the bladder after the patient has urinated.; Cystoscopy: A small scope is inserted into the patient's urethra to check the condition of the urethra and bladder.; Urine analysis: helps find blood and bacteria that exist in urine.; Urodynamic testing: this method evaluates bladder contraction strength and urine flow rate.; Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA): This test helps determine prostate cancer.\nIn addition, your doctor may also ask about any medications you are taking that may affect your urinary system. Specifically, antidepressants, diuretics, antihistamines, sedatives, high blood pressure medications...\n\nTreatment methods for prostate enlargement\nNot all cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia require intervention. In some mild cases, patients do not need medical treatment or surgery. The doctor will base on the International prostate symptom score (IPSS) and the quality of life scale to provide appropriate treatment.\nSome recommended treatments for prostate enlargement are as follows:\n1. Natural method\nNatural treatment means not using drugs or surgical intervention, but making lifestyle changes, exercise, and rest to help reduce symptoms of the disease, including:\nUrinate as soon as you feel the urge; Frequent urination, even when there is no urge to urinate; Avoid taking over-the-counter respiratory medications or antihistamines because they can inhibit your bladder, making it difficult to empty your bladder; Avoid alcohol and caffeinated drinks, especially after dinner; Regulate mood, reduce stress, because stress can increase the number of urination; Regular exercise helps reduce the severity of the disease; Learn and practice Kegel exercises to strengthen the pelvic muscles; Keep your body warm, as cold can make symptoms worse\n2. Treatment with medication\nIn case natural remedies are not effective, the doctor will prescribe the patient medication to treat prostate enlargement including: (5)\nAlpha-1 blockers: This is a group of drugs that relax bladder and prostate muscles to help urine flow more easily such as: Doxazosin, Prazosin, Alfuzosin, Terazosin... The effectiveness of these drugs can be seen within a few minutes. days or weeks. Unwanted side effects can cause patients to have low blood pressure, fatigue, physical weakness and dizziness.; Hormone-reducing drugs (5 alpha-reductase inhibitors): Drugs that reduce levels of the hormone dihydrotestosterone produced by the prostate such as Dutasteride and Finasteride are often prescribed in this case. Medications can make the prostate smaller (especially if the prostate is > 30 mL) and improve urine flow. However, the drug can also lead to unwanted side effects such as erectile dysfunction and decreased sexual desire. Therefore, doctors often combine these drugs with alpha-1 blockers to achieve greater treatment effectiveness and reduce side effects.; Antimuscarinic drugs: Antimuscarinic drugs such as Oxybutynin ER, Solifenacin have the effect of relaxing smooth muscles, treating overactive bladder causing urgency and incontinence. Some side effects of the drug are dry mouth, constipation...; Antibiotics: If the prostate is chronically inflamed due to bacterial causes, treatment with antibiotics may improve the symptoms of the disease. However, in cases where the prostate is not inflamed by bacteria, these drugs are not effective.; Herbs: Herbs such as Hoang Dia Hoang, Hoai Son, Phu Linh, Dan Bi, Trach Dia, Xa Tien Tu... are said to have the ability to treat prostate enlargement and are actually applied in many countries. . However, the mechanism of action is currently unknown.\n3. Surgical methods\nIf drug treatment is ineffective, a number of non-invasive or minimally invasive procedures are performed to address the symptoms of prostate enlargement.(5)\nOutpatient intervention\nThese procedures are typically penetrating needle ablation (TUNA), microwave therapy  (TUMT), steam therapy (Rezūm), water thermotherapy (WIT), high-intensity focused ultrasound ( HIFU), Urolift implant…\nBoth the Urolift and Rezūm methods have been proven to provide positive results, are minimally invasive, cost-effective and help maintain better sexual function.\nInpatient intervention\nSome more in-depth intervention procedures may be recommended, if the patient has one of the following problems such as: kidney failure, bladder stones, recurrent urinary tract infections, urinary incontinence, complete inability to ability to expel urine from the bladder, recurrent hematuria...\nIntervention methods include:\nLaparoscopic prostate surgery (TURP): This method is most commonly used for prostate enlargement because it is highly effective. Through the urethra, the doctor inserts a laparoscopic knife into the prostate and cuts them into small pieces. Small pieces will be sucked out and through the endoscope.; Simple prostatectomy: The doctor makes an incision in the abdomen or perineum, the area behind the scrotum. The inner muscle mass of the prostate will be removed, leaving only the outer part. This procedure causes the patient to stay in the hospital for a long time, up to 10 days.; Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP): The doctor will make a small incision in the prostate and bladder neck. This incision helps clear the flow of urine from the bladder. In this case, sometimes the patient does not need to stay in the hospital.\n\nDangerous complications of the disease\nSymptoms of prostate enlargement are very confusing or vague, so they can easily be overlooked. However, early treatment is always more effective and helps you avoid the following possible dangerous complications:\nSudden urinary retention: At this time, you may need to have a catheter inserted into your bladder to drain urine. Some men with the disease need surgery to relieve urinary retention; Urinary tract infection (UTI): Stagnant urine can increase the risk of urinary tract infection. If this happens frequently, you may need surgery to remove part of your prostate.; Bladder stones: Stones can cause infection, bladder irritation, blood in the urine, and block the flow of urine.; Bladder damage. A residual bladder can become stretched and become weak over time. As a result, the bladder muscles do not contract well, causing the patient to urinate uncleanly.; Kidney damage: Pressure from urine stagnation in the bladder can directly damage the kidneys or bacteria can attack the urethra and cause kidney damage.; Effects on overall health: Acute urinary retention and kidney damage can seriously threaten the patient's health.\n\nHow to prevent it\nTo preserve prostate health and prevent the risk of enlargement, Urology experts at Tam Anh General Hospital System recommend that you:\nManage stress to maintain balance and reduce negative effects on the body; Quit smoking: Staying away from cigarettes helps men's health be better, including the prostate; Avoid drinking a lot of water in the evening to reduce nocturnal urination; Try to empty your bladder every time you urinate; Practice exercises to improve pelvic floor and bladder health; Talk to your doctor to avoid taking medications that can worsen symptoms of prostate enlargement; Adding healthy foods helps improve prostate health\nSee more: What should you eat if you have prostate enlargement?\nIncrease movement and exercise to keep your body healthy\nCenter for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology - Urology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts, Internal Medicine and Surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
