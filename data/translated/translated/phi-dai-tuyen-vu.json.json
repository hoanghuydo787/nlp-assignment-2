    "content": "Breast enlargement: Causes, symptoms and treatments\n\nBreast hypertrophy is an abnormally large breast condition caused by mammary tissue fibers growing rapidly and beyond normal levels, and can occur on one or both sides of the chest. Most of these fibroids are quite benign, do not cause pain or damage to the patient, but cause the body to become unbalanced and pose many health risks. Understand the causes, symptoms as well as treatment to protect your health and regain a balanced appearance for yourself.\n\nWhat is breast enlargement?\nBreast hypertrophy is a condition when mammary tissue fibers grow rapidly and heavily beyond normal levels (>3% of body weight), which can occur on one side or both breasts. Most of these fibroids are quite benign, but they cause imbalance in the body and are potentially dangerous.\nBreast enlargement is considered a benign disease, common in women\n\nHow many main types of hypertrophy are there?\nDepending on the size of the mammary gland, there are two different levels of enlargement:\nEnlarged breasts (macromastia): breast volume <2.5kg, in both men and women between the ages of 6-25.; Giant breasts (gigantomastia): breast volume >2.5kg, high rate in post-pregnant women or obese men.\n\nSymptoms of breast enlargement\nBreast enlargement often has the following symptoms:\nInitially, the nipples are enlarged, touching the nipples feels like the center may have a large, firm, solid nucleus.; This nucleus increasingly spreads into a halo that we can move and feel like a cushion in the breast.; Breast volume is many times larger; Breasts sag, the greater the degree of hypertrophy, the more severe the sagging is.; The skin of the chest area is stretchy and flabby; Breast pain.; Pain in back, shoulders, neck.; Infection or abscess; Loss of nipple sensation; Redness, itching, warmth above or below the breast.\n\nCauses of breast enlargement\nThe exact cause has not yet been confirmed, there are a number of theories including:\nAbnormal increase in hormone levels (Estrogen, Prolactin) or increased body sensitivity to endocrine glands; The concentration of growth hormone secreted exceeds the necessary threshold, stimulating the development of epidermal tissue in the breast.; Increased proliferation of adipose tissue, breast tissue or mammary gland tissue due to lifestyle habits or genetics.; Other factors: pregnancy, stress, obesity, premenopause...\n\nIs breast enlargement dangerous?\nThis is a question of concern for women when encountering this disease, does breast enlargement affect their health and cause any complications? In fact, 80% of breast enlargement does not cause any pain or damage to the patient. However, breast enlargement has many negative consequences, affecting aesthetics and potentially many health risks.\nLoss of aesthetics: Large, sagging breasts; An unbalanced body makes women lose self-esteem and feel guilty; Shoulder and neck pain, back pain, arm numbness, headache...; The lumbar spine tends to curve forward; Choosing the right outfit and bra is difficult; Difficulties and inconveniences in daily life; Feeling of difficulty breathing; Easy to lose sensation in the nipples; Nipples are often enlarged; Breast fold ulcers...; Breast skin is stretched and loose; Rash on the skin around the breast\nBreast enlargement causes loss of aesthetics and has many potential health hazards\n\nHow to treat breast enlargement?\nBecause the hypertrophy is related to the soft tissue structure inside the breast, the most thorough treatment is surgery:\nRemoval of breast tissue; Remove excess breast skin; Hang and pull the nipple to the appropriate position; Areola reduction; Changes in inframammary folds; The entire nipple peduncle, mammary duct and nipple tip will be retained to preserve the feeding function, reduce the risk of sensory disorders, and limit physiological effects.\nBased on the severity of the disease, the doctor will choose the appropriate method:\nBefore and after images of a breast enlargement surgery\nDepartment of Breast Surgery, Tam Anh General Hospital System with a team of experts and doctors who are skilled, dedicated, enthusiastic, and confident in mastering the most advanced techniques.\nIn addition, Tam Anh hospital's team of experts also has the support of modern machinery and imaging diagnostic equipment such as: Mammomat Inspiration 3D digital mammography (DBT) system; GE Logiq E10S ultrasound machine, with probe that supports breast elastography, microvascular survey and biopsy orientation support under ultrasound; The new generation Magnetom Amira BioMatrix 1.5 tesla MRI machine... will help detect early and have safe and effective treatment plans for breast diseases.\nTo schedule an appointment for examination and treatment of breast enlargement with leading experts at the Department of Breast Surgery, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nAlthough breast enlargement is a benign disease, it affects body shape and appearance, as well as many potential health risks (causing difficulty breathing, back and neck pain, numbness in arms, body imbalance...) . Therefore, it is necessary to detect and treat it promptly to quickly regain confidence and health for women.",
