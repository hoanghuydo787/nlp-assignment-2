    "content": "Arm lymphedema: Causes, treatment and prevention\n\nArm lymphedema is a sequela after breast cancer treatment. In particular, this condition may appear in patients who have had axillary lymph node dissection, and the risk is increased in patients who have had axillary radiotherapy. Arm lymphedema is not completely curable, but early treatment can help reduce symptoms and prevent further symptoms.\n\nWhat is arm lymphedema?\nArm lymphedema is a phenomenon of fluid accumulation and stagnation in the lymphatic system, leading to arm swelling. The patient feels pain and has difficulty moving and moving the limbs, causing difficulty in daily activities. Arm lymphedema is a sequela after breast cancer treatment (accounting for about 10-15%). In particular, this condition can appear in patients who have had axillary lymph node dissection, and the risk is increased in patients who have had axillary radiotherapy.\nLymphedema can appear days, weeks, months or even years after cancer treatment. Arm lymphedema cannot be completely cured, but it helps reduce symptoms and prevent other symptoms, importantly preventing damage to the hands.\n\nCauses of arm lymphedema\nThe cause is that lymph fluid cannot circulate normally. This comes from 2 main reasons:\nPrimary: This form is rare due to developmental disorders, usually occurring in the 20s; Secondary: Disease caused by another disease such as infectious disease (strep, worms) or damage from trauma caused by radiation therapy for cancer. Common types of cancer are breast cancer, prostate cancer, and lymphoma.\nArm lymphedema is a permanent sequela if not prevented, detected promptly and treated early.\n\nRisk subjects\nSubjects undergoing any procedure that damages the lymphatic vessels may cause edema.\nHave cancer or are undergoing cancer treatment.; Radiation cancer treatment; Infection; Prolonged exposure to toxic and radioactive substances; Have psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune diseases; Have had surgery in the past and have a large surgical area; Unsanitary living conditions; Fat.; Elder.\n\nSymptoms of arm lymphedema\nDepending on the severity, the signs of the disease are also different. Arm lymphedema often has the following symptoms:\nSwelling of all or part of the arm; Pain, heaviness; The infection recurs many times.; The affected skin area is hard and thickened.\nThese symptoms range from mild to severe. In severe cases, the size of the fingers and toes changes, and even makes it difficult to use.\n\nDiagnostic method\nTo diagnose arm lymphedema, there are the following methods:\nVascular Doppler ultrasound: An accurate, fast method to determine damage at the site of edema; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This method helps examine the tissues and characteristics of edema; Computed tomography (CT): Helps show congested areas of the lymphatic system.; Radionuclide imaging: Using radioactive dye to observe the entire lymphatic system. However, this method is currently less popular in Vietnam because of its high technical requirements.\n\nTreatment of lymphedema\nLymphedema currently has no specific treatment, it cannot be completely cured, but mainly reduces pain and swelling, usually with the following methods:\nExercises: Practice moving the affected arm to help lymph fluid circulate. Note, only exercise moderately, gently stretch the muscles.; Massage: This method helps the flow of lymph move gently to the lymph nodes. Note that this method is not recommended for people with cancer. Avoid massaging skin areas that have been treated with radiation.; Bandage the injured arm: Use a bandage to wrap around the entire injured limb, creating pressure to push lymph fluid back into the limb and trunk. Note, when wrapping, you must wrap your fingers tightly, and gradually loosen as you move to your arm.\nUse a bandage to wrap around the entire damaged limb, creating pressure to push lymph fluid back into the limb and trunk\nAir compression: A method of using a pump attached to the arm, where the damaged area is, and then inflating the sleeve, creating pressure to move lymph fluid from the fingers to help reduce swelling in the arm.; Compression garments: Include long sleeves or socks to compress the arms. This method is often recommended by doctors after reducing swelling in the hands with other methods.; Surgery: In severe lymphedema, your doctor may consider surgery to remove excess tissue in your arm. However, surgery only reduces severe swelling and cannot cure it completely.\n\nHow to prevent lymphedema?\nAccording to MSc. Nguyen Do Thuy Giang (Head of Breast Surgery Department, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City), to prevent arm lymphedema, the following things should be noted:\nYou should GO TO THE EXAMINATION immediately when you notice signs of lymphedema: Signs of lymphedema include: swelling in the arms, legs, hands, fingers, neck or chest.\nAvoid taking blood from an arm at risk of lymphedema: When measuring your blood pressure, you should measure it in an arm with a low risk of lymphedema. Consider purchasing a medical alert bracelet to warn others not to take blood, give an IV, or inject into an arm at risk for lymphedema.; When measuring blood pressure, you should measure it on the arm that is less likely to develop lymphedema.; Consider purchasing a medical alert bracelet to warn others not to take blood, give an IV, or inject into an arm at risk for lymphedema.; Do not bathe in hot water for too long. Do not use hot packs or other heat treatments. Do not massage too vigorously in areas at risk of lymphedema. Limit your arms' exposure to sunlight if possible.; Do not use hot packs or other heat treatments.; Do not massage too vigorously in areas at risk of lymphedema.; Limit your arms' exposure to sunlight if possible.; Do not carry heavy objects or carry heavy bags on your shoulders.; Do not wear clothes or jewelry that are too tight; Raise the patient's arm high: If you sleep on your back, you should keep your leg higher than your heart.; Change position, do not lie on your side or sit for a long time leaning on the arm on the sick side.; You should wear protective gear to protect your hands from injury, because cuts, sunburn, burns, insect bites, and animal scratches can all increase the risk of lymphedema. Do not let sharp objects penetrate the skin. Always use a thimble when sewing (“a thimble” is a device that protects the fingertips when embroidering or sewing), wear thick gloves when gardening, and apply insect repellent when going outside. Keep your skin moisturized by applying a gentle moisturizer to prevent dry and chapped skin. If you get a manicure, you should not cut or pull off the cuticles. Wear gloves when doing housework or gardening to avoid injury to your hands, fingers or nails.; Do not let sharp objects penetrate the skin; Always use a thimble when sewing (“a thimble” is a device that protects the fingertips when embroidering or sewing), wear thick gloves when gardening, and apply insect repellent when going outside.; Moisturize your skin by applying a gentle moisturizer to prevent dry and chapped skin.; If you get a manicure, you should not cut or pull off the cuticles; Wear gloves when doing housework or gardening to avoid injury to your hands, fingers or nails.; Adopt a balanced and low-salt diet.
