    "content": "Stomach polyps: Causes, symptoms and prevention\n\nStomach polyps often have few or unclear symptoms. These tumors are mostly benign and do not cause many dangerous health effects. However, to minimize the risk of some dangerous complications, patients need to contact a doctor for thorough treatment.\n\nWhat are stomach polyps?\nStomach polyps are clumps of cells that form on the lining inside the stomach. Most stomach polyps are benign, but there are some that have a high risk of turning into stomach cancer.\n\nSymptoms of stomach polyps\nMost cases of stomach polyps have no symptoms. They are often discovered accidentally when the patient is examined for other stomach problems. However, some signs that can be recognized include:\nUndigested; Acid reflux; Heartburn; Stomach-ache; Eat quickly and feel full; Tired; When large polyps can cause bleeding, anemia, or blockage of the digestive tract.(1)\n\nCauses of stomach polyps\nStomach polyps form in response to damage to the stomach lining. Some common causes include:\nChronic gastritis: This condition leads to the formation of polyps and hyperplastic adenomas, but most are unlikely to develop into cancer, except in clumps of cells larger than 1 cm.; Chronic gastritis: This condition leads to the formation of polyps and hyperplastic adenomas, but most are unlikely to develop into cancer, except in clumps of cells larger than 1 cm.\nFamilial polyposis: This is a rare genetic syndrome that causes certain cells on the inner lining of the stomach to form polyps (adenomatous polyps). Familial adenomatous polyposis can also cause adenomas.; Familial polyposis: This is a rare genetic syndrome that causes certain cells on the inner lining of the stomach to form polyps (adenomatous polyps). Familial adenomatous polyposis can also cause adenomas.\nAbuse of certain stomach medications: Adenomatous polyps often appear commonly in people who regularly use Proton pump inhibitors to reduce stomach acid. These polyps are usually small in size and are not a cause for concern.; Abuse of certain stomach medications: Adenomatous polyps often appear commonly in people who regularly use Proton pump inhibitors to reduce stomach acid. These polyps are usually small in size and are not a cause for concern.\n\nTypes of stomach polyps\nStomach polyps are divided into 3 main types. Specifically includes:\n1. Fundic gland polyps\nFundic gland polyps are the most common gastric polyps. They often appear in the bottom or upper part of the stomach. During endoscopy we can see polyps, which are usually small, flat or raised. These polyps rarely develop into cancer. Fundic gland polyps are often associated with long-term use of proton pump inhibitors. In those cases, the doctor may advise the patient to stop taking the medication. (3)\n2. Hyperplastic polyps\nThis is the second most common type of gastric polyp, after fundic adenomatous polyp. This mass of cells often appears in pedunculated or sessile form, with a diameter of less than 2cm, grows in clusters and is scattered everywhere in the stomach, even near ulcers.(5)\nHistologically, this is an increase in Foveolar cells at the surface, creating a spiral shape that extends and penetrates deep into the lamina propria. Gastric hyperplastic polyps may contain pyloric glands, principal cells, and parietal cells and have a histological appearance that may overlap with benign lung tumors (Hamartomas) and inflammation.\nWith hyperplastic polyps, the surface epithelium may also be eroded or ulcerated, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding. That is also the reason why these cell clumps often have a close relationship with disorders that cause inflammation or irritation of the stomach (chronic gastritis, H. pylori gastritis, pernicious anemia... ). In cases caused by H. pylorivi bacteria, successful treatment will help heal hyperplastic polyps.\nNormally, the risk of cancer associated with this type of polyp is not high but can lead to malignant tumors on the stomach lining, especially when the patient has chronic gastritis. In this case, the doctor may perform biopsies of multiple areas around the polyp.\n3. Adenoma polyps\nThis is the most common type of neoplastic polyp, often found near the base of the stomach and is the beginning of stomach cancer as well as a number of other locations in the body. Histologically, adenomatous polyps are classified similarly to colon adenomas with tubular, villous, and branched shapes. This mass of cells is usually distributed singly, most commonly in the cavity but can also appear anywhere in the stomach. Endoscopically, adenomatous polyps are often sessile and large in size.\nAtrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia are highly associated with the development of this type of polyp. In addition, adenoma polyps larger than 2cm with villous histology have a high risk of leading to cancer, specifically about 28 - 40%. In this case, the doctor needs to perform additional tests to accurately diagnose and ensure effective treatment. In addition, removal of all polyps may also be performed to limit the increased risk of cancer. This process is often performed using an endoscope, or even surgery if the number of polyps is large or the cancer has begun to metastasize.\nAdenoma polyps often appear commonly in countries with high rates of stomach cancer such as China, Korea, Japan... Not to mention, the incidence rate in the West also accounts for 6 - 10% of the population. Total number of cases of polyp detection.\n\nSubjects susceptible to stomach polyps\nStomach polyps can occur in both men and women and at any age, but people aged 45 years and older often face a higher risk. Among them, fundic gland polyps are often found in middle-aged women.(2)\nPatients taking proton pump inhibitors to treat gastritis, acid reflux, or other stomach problems may be at higher risk of developing stomach polyps.\nThe presence of H. pylori bacteria in a patient's stomach can also increase the risk of stomach polyps. All patients should be tested for active H. pylori infection; If present, the infection should be treated.\nIn addition, people who have a habit of smoking, do not exercise, etc. are susceptible to stomach polyps.\n\nDiagnosis of gastric polyps\nStomach polyps are often found incidentally during an endoscopy for another stomach problem. An endoscopy is a procedure in which an endoscope, a flexible tube with a camera on one end, is inserted into the mouth and down into the stomach for examination.\nAlthough the majority of stomach polyps (more than 90%) do not lead to cancer, some types of polyps require additional testing to ensure they are free of cancer cells. If an abnormal area is found, a biopsy (tissue sample) can be taken while the endoscope undergoes histopathological testing to look for cancer cells.\n\nHow to treat stomach polyps\nTreatment of stomach polyps will depend on the type, size and cause of formation. As follows:\n1. Remove polyps\nLarge stomach polyps often have a high risk of developing cancer. For example, in case a cell mass larger than 10mm in diameter is detected during endoscopy, the doctor may decide to remove it immediately. This process is called polypectomy. Specifically as follows:(4)\nFundic adenomatous polyps: If adenomatous polyps are found but are not accompanied by unusual signs, no additional treatment is needed. However, when the cell mass is larger than 10mm in diameter, resection is necessary. If there is dysplasia in the tissue surrounding the polyp, the doctor will perform the same examination as for cancer, possibly even with a colonoscopy.; Fundic adenomatous polyps: If adenomatous polyps are found but are not accompanied by unusual signs, no additional treatment is needed. However, when the cell mass is larger than 10mm in diameter, resection is necessary. If there is dysplasia in the tissue surrounding the polyp, your doctor will perform the same examination as for cancer, possibly even with a colonoscopy.\nHyperplastic polyps: Hyperplastic polyps are usually the only ones tested and examined, especially for H. pylori infection. In some cases, patients will be monitored with endoscopy after one year. After this point, if the polyp is still present or dysplasia is detected in the biopsy, excision will be performed.; Hyperplastic polyps: Hyperplastic polyps are usually the only ones tested and examined, especially for H. pylori infection. In some cases, patients will be monitored with endoscopy after one year. After this point, if the polyp is still present or dysplasia is detected in the biopsy, excision will be performed.\nAdenoma polyps: This type of polyp has a high risk of developing into cancer so it is often removed. If adenomatous polyps are not removed during the first colonoscopy, your doctor will likely repeat the procedure within 6 to 12 months. In addition, examination and biopsy of surrounding areas are also performed to monitor cancer cells as well as other dysplasia.; Adenoma polyps: This type of polyp has a high risk of developing into cancer so it is often removed. If adenomatous polyps are not removed during the first colonoscopy, your doctor will likely repeat the procedure within 6 to 12 months. In addition, examination and biopsy of surrounding areas are also performed to monitor for cancer cells as well as other dysplasia.\nIn case polyps appear too much, gastric bypass surgery can be used to remove part or all of the organ. However, the stomach lining has a special structure with many folds, making this process complicated. Therefore, patients need to consider choosing reputable doctors and hospitals to minimize unwanted risks.\n2. Treat infection\nIf the exam finds an infection or inflammation along with a tumor, your doctor may prescribe medication to treat it. This solution is commonly performed in cases of H. pylori infection.\n3. Should gastric polyps be removed?\nStomach polyp removal is only performed in cases where the cell mass is large in size and has a high chance of developing into cancer. However, the implementation process must follow the doctor's instructions. If the polyp is small, this procedure will likely have more undesirable side effects, such as bleeding.\n\nHow to prevent stomach polyps?\nStomach polyps often arise from benign conditions, but in the long term, some cases can increase the risk of cancer. Therefore, early prevention is essential. Some useful guides include:\nControl risk factors that can cause stomach polyps; Minimize the use of Proton pump inhibitors, only use when prescribed by a doctor; Maintaining a reasonable weight is also a way to protect a healthy digestive system and body; Regular health check-ups to detect stomach polyps early, making the treatment process more effective and convenient; Talk to a specialist about your personal and family medical history to determine the risk of stomach polyps forming.; Maintain a reasonable diet full of nutrients to minimize gastrointestinal problems such as indigestion, reflux, etc.\n\nQuestions about stomach polyps\n1. Is stomach polyps dangerous?\nStomach polyps are only dangerous if they develop into malignant tumors or increase the risk of stomach cancer. However, patients should not be subjective, instead they need to perform regular health checks to detect and eliminate them early to limit unwanted complications.\n2. What should you eat and avoid with stomach polyps?\nAfter gastric polyp removal, patients need to supplement nutritious foods that are good for their health and stomach. In particular, the daily menu should prioritize vegetables and fruits... In addition, easy-to-digest dishes such as porridge, stew... are also ideal choices for this time.\nIn addition, patients should avoid hard foods, which make it difficult for the body to digest. At the same time, spicy, sour, salty and greasy foods will also negatively hinder the stomach's ability to recover.\n3. Are stomach polyps contagious?\nStomach polyps are not contagious from person to person. However, the cause of chronic gastritis and polyps such as H.pylori can be transmitted through food.\n4. Does having stomach polyps have any effects?\nStomach polyps often have no obvious symptoms and are mostly only discovered through routine endoscopy. In addition, the chance of these cell masses developing into cancer is also very small (from 6 - 10%). However, if the stomach polyp is large in size, it will also cause some unpleasant symptoms, affecting health and daily activities such as: indigestion, heartburn, abdominal pain, stomach bleeding... Therefore , early detection and treatment is extremely necessary.\nCenter for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City) and Department of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreatic (Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing High-class, effective examination and treatment services for patients with mild to severe liver problems (fatty liver, acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer...).
