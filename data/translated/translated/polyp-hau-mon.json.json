    "content": "Anal polyps: Causes, symptoms and prevention\n\nAnal polyps are not a high-risk disease if detected and treated early. The disease can happen to many people, especially people over 40 years old.\n\nWhat are anal polyps?\nPolyps are abnormal growths of tissue on the inner surface of body organs, most commonly found in mucous membranes. Polyps can appear in many locations, including the anal area. Like other polyps, anal polyps often have a small, mushroom-like stem shape; Size is usually less than 2.5cm. Anal polyps need to be detected and treated early to limit the risk of adverse health effects\nCommon types of polyps\nThere are 3 common types of anal polyps, including:\nInflammatory and benign polyps: This is the type of polyp in the anus, accounting for the largest proportion of about 80%. Inflammatory polyps are also called hyperplastic polyps; is the result of an inflammatory reaction in the colon-anus area. This type of polyp rarely becomes malignant. Pathology is epithelial fibrous polyp.(1); Inflammatory and benign polyps: This is the type of polyp in the anus, accounting for the largest proportion of about 80%. Inflammatory polyps are also called hyperplastic polyps; is the result of an inflammatory reaction in the colon-anus area. This type of polyp rarely becomes malignant. Pathology is epithelial fibrous polyp.(1)\nLymphatic polyps: Account for about 15%; Lymphatic polyps: Accounts for about 15%\nAdenomatous polyps: Adenomatous polyps account for the smallest percentage but have a high risk of malignancy. The larger the size of the adenoma-like polyp, the greater the risk of having cancer cells in the polyp.; Adenomatous polyps: Adenomatous polyps account for the smallest percentage but have a high risk of malignancy. The larger the size of the adenoma-like polyp, the greater the risk of having cancer cells in the polyp.\nPolyps are generally mushroom-shaped with long stalks\n\nCauses of anal polyps\nWhat causes anal polyps? Polyps arise from abnormal growth of tissues. If normal development follows, the body will produce and divide new cells to replace old \"damaged\" or unnecessary cells. However, in some cases, the amount of new cells produced is more than necessary, this will form polyps - if in the anal area, it will be anal polyps.\nThe reason behind this abnormality is still unknown, but there are a number of factors that are considered to influence the formation of anal polyps.\nChromosomal inheritance: If either parent has had anal polyps, the risk of inheriting it to the child is also higher than normal.; Chromosomal inheritance: If either parent has had anal polyps, the risk of inheriting it to the child is also higher than normal.\nAbnormal anal structure: If the anus has a curved or narrow shape, it will affect the function of pushing stool, making the mucosa susceptible to infection. Over time, waste will accumulate, causing the anus to become infected and shaped. into polyps; Abnormal anal structure: If the anus has a curved or narrow shape, it will affect the function of pushing stool, making the mucosa susceptible to infection. Over time, waste will accumulate, causing the anus to become infected and shaped. into polyps.\nAnal sex: Having sex this way can easily cause scratches and damage to the anus. If abused, it will be a high risk factor for disease.; Anal sex: Having sex this way can easily cause scratches and damage to the anus.

To recognize the disease, you can rely on the following characteristic signs:\nAnal prolapse after defecation; Anal prolapse after defecation\nAbdominal pain: Once a polyp grows too large, it will compress many organs. This can cause intestinal semi-obstruction, causing the patient to experience intermittent abdominal cramps.; Abdominal pain: Once a polyp grows too large, it will compress many organs. This can cause intestinal semi-obstruction, causing the patient to experience intermittent abdominal cramps.\nBlood in the stool: This is a clear sign of anal polyps. Blood during bowel movements due to anal polyps is often bright red, often detected when using toilet paper, not dripping - a sign of external hemorrhoids or anal fissures.; Blood in the stool: This is a clear sign of anal polyps. Blood during bowel movements due to anal polyps is often bright red, often detected when using toilet paper, but does not appear as drops - a sign of external hemorrhoids or anal fissures.\nLoose stools: Polyps in the anus can cause bowel movements, causing patients to change their bowel habits such as loose stools and frequent bowel movements a day.; Loose stools: Polyps in the anus can cause bowel movements, causing patients to change their bowel habits such as loose stools and frequent bowel movements a day.\nFatigue and physical weakness: Because polyps often cause bleeding and abdominal pain, the patient's health will have many negative changes such as dizziness, fatigue, paleness, etc.; Fatigue and physical weakness: Because polyps often cause bleeding and abdominal pain, the patient's health will have many negative changes such as dizziness, fatigue, paleness, etc.\nOther signs: Some cases may experience warning symptoms of anal polyps such as vomiting/nausea, fever that is difficult to reduce,...; Other signs: Some cases may experience warning symptoms of anal polyps such as vomiting/nausea, fever that is difficult to reduce, etc.\n\nTreatment of anal polyps\nAnal polyps can be detected through colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, virtual colonoscopy, and stool tests. Through this, polyps can be screened for treatment.(2)\nThere are 2 main methods of treating anal polyps depending on the size and complexity of the polyp.\nMedical treatment: Aims to reduce symptoms associated with polyps, but cannot dissolve polyps. Some commonly used medications include anti-inflammatory drugs, pain relievers, and special medications to help remove polyps; Medical treatment: Aims to reduce symptoms associated with polyps, but cannot dissolve polyps. Some commonly used medications include anti-inflammatory drugs, pain relievers, and special medications to help remove polyps.\nSurgical treatment: In cases where the polyp cannot be dissolved by itself with medication, polyp removal is a necessary treatment method. Special surgical treatment is applied to polyps in the anus that are large in size or have a high risk of turning into cancer.; Surgical treatment: In cases where the polyp cannot be dissolved by itself with medication, polyp removal is a necessary treatment method. Special surgical treatment is applied to polyps in the anus that are large in size or have a high risk of turning into cancer.\nAfter being removed, the anal polyp will be sent to the laboratory to check if there are cancer cells; whether it is a benign or malignant polyp. This result will affect the frequency of endoscopy later.\n\nHow to prevent anal polyps?\nCurrently, there is no way to completely prevent anal polyps. However, there are some things that can help you reduce your risk of getting the disease. Not only does it prevent anal polyps, but the following healthy habits also help improve general health and prevent many other diseases.(3)\nIncrease green vegetables and fruits to supplement fiber; Limit alcohol and tobacco; Exercise at least 30 minutes a day; Limit consumption of red meat and processed foods; Try to maintain a healthy weight (body mass index between 18.5 and 25); Lose weight if overweight/obese.\nA healthy diet rich in fiber contributes to the prevention of anal polyps\n\nFrequently asked questions about anal polyps\nBelow are some frequently asked questions about anal polyps. Based on the answers, you can be better prepared if you encounter this digestive disease.\n1. Are anal polyps dangerous?\nAnal polyps can cause dangerous complications. In addition to the risk of cancer, anal polyps if treated late can lead to: anal infections, intestinal problems (constipation, prolonged diarrhea,...), genetics. Therefore, when polyps are discovered - no matter what type - they need to be removed as soon as possible.\n2. Do anal polyps affect the patient's life?\nThe answer is yes! Not only does it affect the patient with symptoms such as anal prolapse that interferes with daily activities, abdominal pain, abnormal bowel movements, fatigue, etc., but if anal polyps persist for a long time, it also increases the risk of complications. Serious – the most serious is anal cancer.\n3. Distinguish between hemorrhoids and anal polyps?\nMany people easily confuse hemorrhoids and anal polyps. The reason is that both of these diseases cause the patient to experience discomfort and pain in the anus, bloody stools, and even feel the \"residual meat\" mass as hemorrhoids or polyps. However, if you observe and feel more closely, hemorrhoids and anal polyps have clear differences as follows:\nSymptoms of bloody bowel movements: Hemorrhoids cause the patient to bleed in drops, and bleeding is caused by polyps in the anus, often found in toilet paper used after defecation.; Symptoms of bloody bowel movements: Hemorrhoids cause the patient to bleed in drops, and bleeding is caused by polyps in the anus, often found in toilet paper used after defecation.\nImage: When appearing outside the anus, hemorrhoids are often dark red/purple; The anus often secretes fluid, so it is easy to itch, swell, etc. Meanwhile, if it is a polyp, it will have a long stem, sometimes even twisted, causing discomfort and pain inside the anal canal.; Image: When appearing outside the anus, hemorrhoids are often dark red/purple; The anus often secretes fluid, so it is susceptible to itching, swelling, etc. Meanwhile, if it is a polyp, it will have a long stem, sometimes even twisted, causing discomfort and pain inside the anal canal.\nImpact: Hemorrhoids have little direct impact on other organs such as the small intestine, stomach or colon, etc. On the contrary, anal polyps are related to intestinal irritation; is an important factor in the formation of rectal cancer/anal cancer cells; Impact: Hemorrhoids have little direct impact on other organs such as the small intestine, stomach or colon, etc. On the contrary, anal polyps are related to intestinal irritation; is an important factor in the formation of rectal cancer/anal cancer cells.\nCenter for Endoscopy and Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Surgery, Tam Anh General Hospital is a prestigious medical unit, providing high-end, effective examination and treatment services for patients suffering from digestive problems. Digestion ranges from mild to severe. The center brings together a team of highly specialized and experienced Internal Medicine - Surgery - Gastrointestinal Endoscopy doctors, in addition to the support of a modern medical equipment system imported from abroad, providing optimal service. multiple examination and treatment needs of customers.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of liver diseases with experts at the Gastrointestinal Endoscopy & Surgery Center of Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nIn rare cases, anal polyps can recur.
