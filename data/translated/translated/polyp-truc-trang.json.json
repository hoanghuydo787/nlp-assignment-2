    "content": "Rectal polyps: Causes, symptoms and prevention\n\nRectal polyps are protruding tumors in the rectum that come in many different sizes, up to several centimeters. The larger the polyp size, the higher the risk of malignancy. The disease can occur in many subjects; especially in obese people; alcohol abuse, diabetes, etc.\n\nWhat are rectal polyps?\nThe rectum is the part/position located between the colon and the anal canal; plays a significant role in transporting and eliminating waste from the body. Rectal polyps are a condition in which one or more tumors appear in the rectum; Usually located at the end of the large intestine. The mass of polyp tissue is often mushroom-shaped and sticks to the rectal mucous membrane with a \"stalk\".\nColorectal polyps generally have two types: sessile (flat polyp) and pedunculated, of which the sessile type is more common. There are two different types of polyps with different levels of danger: adenomatous polyps (polyps that develop abnormally) and non-adenomatous polyps (that do not develop abnormally). Accordingly, common types of rectal polyps can be divided as follows:\nTubular adenoma: The cell structure still retains its normal tubular structure. Tubular adenoma accounts for about 70% of cases and is the most common type of polyp.; Tubular adenoma: The cell structure still retains its normal tubular structure. Tubular adenoma accounts for about 70% of cases and is the most common type of polyp.\nHyperplastic polyp: A non-glandular polyp. Hyperplastic polyps are usually small in size. Among all types of polyps, this type of polyp has a low risk of turning into cancer so patients do not need to worry too much when encountering it.; Hyperplastic polyp: A non-glandular polyp. Hyperplastic polyps are usually small in size. Among all types of polyps, this type of polyp has a low risk of turning into cancer, so patients do not need to worry too much when encountering it.\nSerrated polyp: This type of polyp is small (usually less than 5mm), round in shape and has no stem. Serrated polyps are difficult to detect, are a dangerous type of adenoma and are considered a pre-cancerous risk. Depending on the size, histopathological type and degree of dysplasia at the time of detection of the polyp, the tumors have different risks of malignancy.; Serrated polyp: This type of polyp is small (usually less than 5mm), round in shape and has no stem. Serrated polyps are difficult to detect, are a dangerous type of adenoma and are considered a pre-cancerous risk. Depending on the size, histopathological type and degree of dysplasia at the time of detection of the polyp, the tumors have different risks of malignancy.\nInflammatory polyps: Often occur in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. This is not a true polyp but is actually a reaction to chronic inflammation in the rectum. often appears in people with chronic ulcerative colitis or people with colorectal Crohn's disease; Inflammatory polyps: Often occur in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. This is not a true polyp but is actually a reaction to chronic inflammation in the rectum. often appears in people with chronic ulcerative colitis or people with colorectal Crohn's disease.\nBranch duct adenoma: About 5-15% of patients suffer from this type of polyp and is a mixture of the above two types. Polyps vary in size, are pedunculated or sessile, and have a low risk of cancer; Branch duct adenoma: About 5-15% of patients suffer from this type of polyp and is a mixture of the above two types. Polyps vary in size, are pedunculated or sessile, and have a low risk of cancer.\nSome forms of rectal polyps can become malignant\n\nWho is at risk for rectal polyps?\nSeveral factors may increase the risk of developing colon polyps. If you or a loved one has one or more of the following factors, you need to pay more attention:\nPeople over 50 years old; People who are overweight or obese; Have a family history of polyps or colorectal cancer (1); Have had polyps in the past; Women with ovarian or uterine cancer before age 50; Have an inflammatory condition that affects the colon, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis; Have diabetes; Have a genetic disorder, such as Lynch syndrome or Gardner syndrome\nIn addition to the above risks, there are a number of lifestyle behaviors that can contribute to the development of rectal polyps including:\nOr smoke; Drink alcohol regularly; Have a sedentary lifestyle; Diet high in fat and grease; low in fiber\n\nSymptoms of rectal polyps\nMost rectal polyps have no symptoms, which makes it difficult to recognize the disease early. Patients often only discover it when they have a colonoscopy. If the disease progresses to a late stage, the patient may experience many symptoms such as bloody stools, prolapse during bowel movements, or intestinal obstruction.(3)\n\nCauses of rectal polyps\nA colorectal polyp is a small mass of cells that form on the colon mucosa, formed due to excessive/abnormal proliferation of the mucosa. The specific cause of rectal polyps is still unknown. The majority of colorectal polyps are harmless. But over time, some polyps can develop into cancer, which is fatal when detected at a late stage.\nAnyone can get rectal polyps, especially people with the above risk factors.\nStress causes many digestive disorders and is a cause of rectal polyps\n\nMethods of diagnosing rectal polyps\nTo diagnose and detect damage caused by rectal polyps or signs of rectal cancer, in addition to examination and medical history, the patient may be prescribed some of the following methods:\nEndoscopy: The main, highly accurate diagnostic method for rectal polyps is endoscopy. Endoscopy helps identify existing lesions in the rectum, which can be performed using a rigid or flexible scope. This method also helps take tissue samples for observation and biopsy to check the risk of whether the tumor is benign or malignant in case of necessity.(4); Endoscopy: The main, highly accurate diagnostic method for rectal polyps is endoscopy. Endoscopy helps identify existing lesions in the rectum, which can be performed using a rigid or flexible scope. This method also helps take tissue samples for observation and biopsy to check the risk of whether the tumor is benign or malignant in case necessary.(4)\nBlood test in stool: In the early stages of rectal cancer, patients may experience bowel movements with blood. Testing for blood in stool when suffering from rectal polyps provides more accurate results than observing with the naked eye.; Blood test in stool: In the early stages of rectal cancer, patients may experience bowel movements with blood. Testing blood in stool for rectal polyps provides more accurate results than observing with the naked eye.\nMRI (magnetic resonance imaging) / CT scan (CT scan): Depending on the doctor's instructions, the patient will need an MRi or CT scan. Usually this method is applied to patients who cannot have endoscopy to determine the extent of rectal cancer after diagnosis.; MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) / CT scan (CT scan): Depending on the doctor's instructions, the patient will need an MRi or CT scan. Usually this method is applied to patients who cannot have endoscopy to determine the extent of rectal cancer after diagnosis.\n\nAre rectal polyps dangerous?\nAlthough most rectal polyps are benign, some have the potential to become malignant (cancerous). Therefore, the more rectal polyps a person has or the more large they are, the more they need to be careful, alert, and not subjective, because it can turn into cancer at any time. any.\n\nTreatment of rectal polyps\nThe best way to treat colon polyps is to remove them. Your doctor will likely completely remove the polyp during the colonoscopy.\nThe polyps are then sent for histopathological testing to see what type of polyp it is and whether there are any cancer cells. In most cases, doctors can usually remove polyps without performing surgery. This operation is performed in conjunction with diagnostic endoscopy - a minimally invasive procedure. However, the patient may still need surgery to remove the polyp if the polyp is large and cannot be removed during endoscopy.\nAfter polyp removal, treatment is not really over. Polyps are still at risk of forming again; Therefore, patients still need to have regular rectal endoscopy (periodic time depends on the number, size and type of polyps previously removed) to be able to detect early if there is a recurrence of polyps.(2)\n\nMeasures to prevent rectal polyps\nTo reduce the risk of rectal polyps as well as to prevent the disease from progressing, regular health checks are necessary. At the same time, building healthy habits is also necessary to ensure the health of the digestive system in particular and overall health in general. To do so we should:\nIncrease fiber from green vegetables, fruits, and nuts into your diet; You should limit alcohol and tobacco; Supplement vitamin D and calcium as prescribed by your doctor; Exercise regularly for at least 30 minutes a day; Keep a comfortable spirit, do not be under pressure/stress for long periods of time; Live on a stable schedule to help avoid digestive disorders; Get regular check-ups if your family has a history of rectal polyps\nIf we talk about preventive medications, aspirin and COX-2 inhibitors can be used to prevent new polyps from forming in people who already have them. You need to follow your doctor's instructions when using medication to avoid abuse, which can easily cause unwanted side effects.\nCenter for Endoscopy and Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Surgery, Tam Anh General Hospital is a prestigious medical unit, providing high-end, effective examination and treatment services for patients suffering from digestive problems.
