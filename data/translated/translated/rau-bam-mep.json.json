This is the question of many pregnant mothers when diagnosed with this condition. The article below is expertly advised by Doctor Nguyen Huu Cong, Doctor of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Center of Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, and will answer this issue in detail. The placenta (also known as the placenta) is an organ that provides oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, while protecting the fetus from external influences. Therefore, any problem that occurs in the placenta will directly affect the health of mother and baby. Normally, the placenta attaching to the front or back of the uterine fundus is considered normal. However, if the placenta attaches to the lower part of the cervix, covering part or all of the cervix, it will affect the exit of the fetus during labor. This phenomenon is also known as placenta praevia. (1) Doctor Nguyen Huu Cong, Doctor of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Center of Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, said that there are 4 types of placenta previa divided according to the location of the placenta, which are: Low placenta previa: The placenta is attached to the lower part of the uterus, not reaching the uterine opening. Placenta accreta: Placenta attaches near the cervical os. Semi-central placenta previa: The placenta partially covers the uterine opening. Central placenta previa: The placenta completely covers the uterine opening.\n\nWhat is verruca?\nPlacenta accreta or placenta accreta is a condition in which the edge of the placenta is close to the edge of the uterine opening. When the cervix is ​​open, the edge of the placenta can be felt. It can be seen that placenta previa clinging to the edge is a warning sign of the possibility of semi-central and central placenta previa. Therefore, when diagnosed with placenta accreta, pregnant mothers need to strictly follow the doctor's examination schedule and rest instructions to avoid dangerous complications. (2)\n\nThe cause of vegetables sticking to the edges\nCurrently, the cause of placenta praevia in particular and placenta praevia in general has not been clearly determined. Doctor Huu Cong said that the placenta can form anywhere in the uterus depending on the position where the embryo implants. That means, if the embryo implants in the lower part of the uterus, the placenta will develop in this position and will not move upward during pregnancy. The result is placenta previa.\nIn addition, some factors that increase the risk of placenta previa include:\nPregnant women 35 years of age and older;; Women who have gone through childbirth multiple times;; History of miscarriage or multiple abortions;; History of cervical infection;; History of placenta previa in previous pregnancies;; Pregnant mothers carrying twins or multiples with a large placenta will increase the risk of disease;; Abnormal shape of the uterus;; Unhealthy lifestyle and activities, frequent use of stimulants.\nReference: Abnormal conditions in the placenta that are dangerous\n\nSymptoms of placenta previa\nSymptoms of placenta accreta depend on the severity of the disease. Women can soon recognize through some clear symptoms as follows:\nAbnormal vaginal bleeding, which can be fresh blood or blood clots, but does not cause pain. This phenomenon usually occurs in the 3rd trimester (last 3 months of pregnancy).; Vaginal bleeding resolves spontaneously without treatment intervention. Pregnant mothers may see this phenomenon recur after a few days or weeks. Pay attention if the bleeding continues to increase.; In some cases, pregnant mothers may experience abdominal pain due to uterine contractions.\nPregnant mothers with placenta accreta may experience symptoms of abdominal pain due to uterine contractions\n\nIs vegetables stuck to the edges dangerous?\nDr. Huu Cong said, placenta accreta is one of the leading causes of bleeding during pregnancy, even threatening the lives of mother and baby if not detected early and treated promptly. (3)\nFor pregnant mothers\nMany pregnant mothers mistakenly think that the placenta is only dangerous to the fetus. In fact, when placenta is attached to the edges, pregnant mothers are at risk of frequent vaginal bleeding, leading to the risk of anemia and a high risk of premature birth.\nFor the fetus\nIf a pregnant mother has anemia during pregnancy, there is a risk that the fetus will also suffer from anemia, malnutrition, and fetal distress right in the mother's womb. In case the mother has severe anemia, the obstetrician is forced to prescribe a cesarean section as soon as possible, regardless of whether the pregnancy is full term or premature.\nIf premature, premature babies are susceptible to respiratory failure. In case the placenta attaches to the lower part of the uterus, there will be a situation of breech presentation due to difficulty turning the head.\n\nMethod for diagnosing low placenta\nDoctor Huu Cong said that most cases of placenta previa can be detected from the 20th week of pregnancy thanks to fetal ultrasound. During ultrasound, with the support of modern machinery, the obstetrician can observe the image of where the placenta is attached to in the uterus. Therefore, pregnant mothers need to strictly follow the examination schedule and monitor the pregnancy according to the doctor's instructions to detect early and promptly treat abnormalities during pregnancy.\nFetal ultrasound images help detect early placenta and many abnormalities during pregnancy\n\nHow to treat placenta accreta on the edge of the cervix\nThe general principle in treating placenta accreta at the edge of the cervix is ​​to stop the bleeding immediately to ensure the life safety of the pregnant mother. Depending on the age of the fetus and the level of vaginal bleeding, the obstetrician will evaluate and prescribe appropriate blood transfusion to continue the pregnancy or an emergency cesarean section.\nFor pregnant mothers who do not show signs of labor, Dr. Huu Cong recommends that mothers should limit movement, rest a lot, and have a reasonable nutritional supplement diet. If the fetus is full term, monitor and wait for signs of impending birth. If the mother has heavy bleeding, a cesarean section is indicated at any gestational age to stop the bleeding to save the mother.\nFor pregnant mothers in labor, if they notice heavy bleeding, a cesarean section will be indicated. If the bleeding is light and the uterus and fetus are found to be in a favorable position, the amniocentesis will be performed and the membrane will be torn toward the side without the placenta to stop the bleeding. If after tearing the amniotic membrane there is still bleeding, then cesarean section. If there is no more bleeding, vaginal monitoring will continue.\n\nHow to prevent placenta adhesion?\nPlacenta accreta is one of the leading causes of bleeding during pregnancy, threatening the life of the pregnant mother and the fetus. Therefore, Dr. Huu Cong recommends that pregnant mothers should note the following to enjoy a safe and healthy pregnancy. (4)\nDetail:\nAvoid getting pregnant when you are older. In case of pregnancy when you are over 35 years old, you should consult your doctor for advice and plan to monitor your pregnancy closely.; Strictly follow your doctor's instructions after cesarean section to avoid leaving dangerous complications in the old cesarean section; Follow a healthy lifestyle, do not use stimulants during pregnancy such as smoking; Immediately visit a medical facility with a reputable Obstetrics specialty when there are any unusual signs during pregnancy to be examined, accurately diagnosed and given pregnancy care.; Hospitalize immediately for close monitoring if placenta accreta is diagnosed in the last months of pregnancy.\n\nCan I give birth naturally if I have placenta?\nHaving a placenta means that the placenta is located near the cervix, which can cause obstructions during labor, making it difficult for the fetus to move out. Besides, during labor, the mother's cervix will open, which can cause massive bleeding before the fetus comes out. At this time, the mother may become dizzy, faint or even die.\nDoctor Huu Cong said that depending on the health condition of the pregnant mother during labor, the obstetrician will consider whether to give birth normally or by cesarean section. In many cases, it is still possible to have a normal birth if the mother does not bleed much or has no unusual problems.\nUsually, before deciding whether to give birth naturally or by cesarean section, the doctor will order an ultrasound to check the position of the placenta. If vaginal birth has many potential risks, the doctor will prescribe a cesarean section to ensure safety for the pregnant mother and fetus.\nPlacenta accreta is one of the dangerous pregnancy conditions, it is recommended that pregnant mothers choose a medical facility with a reputable Obstetrics department to be examined, diagnosed and cared for during a healthy pregnancy, ensuring their health. and safety for both pregnant mother and fetus.\nObstetrics and Gynecology Center of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of skilled and experienced Obstetrics experts, equipped with modern machinery systems, especially 2D, 3D, 4D ultrasound systems. , color Doppler ultrasound, new generation GE E10 ultrasound..., applying modern protocols in intervention of pregnancy abnormalities from simple to complex, ensuring a healthy pregnancy, safe birth, and a healthy baby. square.\nFor advice and to make an appointment with Obstetrics experts at Tam Anh General Hospital System, pregnant mothers and their families please contact:\nAbove is general information about verruca, hopefully pregnant mothers will have more knowledge to take better care of themselves and their babies, and feel secure to enjoy a happy pregnancy. If you have any questions, pregnant mothers can contact the Tam Anh General Hospital System hotline to receive advice and support from good obstetrics experts!",
