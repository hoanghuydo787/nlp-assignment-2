    "content": "Placenta accreta: Causes, symptoms, treatment and prevention\n\nPlacenta accreta is an extremely dangerous obstetric complication that not only endangers the birth but also threatens the life of the pregnant mother. Statistics show that the incidence of the disease is increasing due to changes in many risk factors, most notably the increase in the rate of prescribed and on-demand cesarean sections.\n\nWhat is placenta accreta?\nPlacenta accreta or placenta accreta, scientifically known as Placenta Accreta, is a condition in which part or all of the placenta invades and does not separate from the uterine wall after giving birth. (first)\nDoctor II Phan The Thi, Doctor at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Center of Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, said that normally the placenta will detach from the uterine wall after the woman gives birth to the baby. The placenta is then expelled outside.\nHowever, when a pregnant mother has placenta accreta, the placenta cannot detach itself from the uterine wall but clings tightly to the uterine muscles, even invading neighboring organs. This is the cause of postpartum hemorrhage, post-operative infection... even death in pregnant women.\nStudies from the 1970s to 1980s showed that the incidence of this condition was 1/2,510 to 1/4,017. In the years 1982-2002, the incidence rate was 1/533. This increasing rate is due to changes in risk factors, most notably the increase in cesarean section becoming more widely prescribed.\n\nClassification of placenta accreta\nDr. Phan The Thi said that based on the level of invasion of the placenta, this placental disease is divided into 3 main types, including: (2)\nAccreta: The placenta attaches directly to the surface of the uterus. This is the most common form, accounting for 75% of all cases; Increta: The placenta penetrates deep into the uterine wall but does not pass through the uterine serosa. This is a moderately common form, accounting for about 15% of all cases; Percreta form: The placenta invades through the uterine muscle into the uterine serosa, even invading neighboring organs such as the intestines, bladder... Although the Percreta form is the least common, only accounting for about 5% of the total. There are a number of cases, but they are the most serious.\n\nCauses of placenta accreta\nUp to now, the exact cause of the disease has not been clearly determined. However, Dr. Phan The Thi said that most pregnant mothers experiencing this condition have something in common: scars on the uterine wall due to cesarean section surgery or uterine fibroid removal.\nIn addition, pregnant mothers with a history of cesarean section or placenta previa also increase the risk of placenta accreta. Statistics show that about 5-10% of cases are in pregnant mothers with placenta previa.\nA cesarean section increases the risk of the placenta not being able to separate automatically from the uterine wall. The more history a pregnant woman has of old surgical incisions, the greater the risk of encountering this condition. Statistics show that over 60% of cases are in pregnant mothers who have had 3 or more old surgical incisions.\n\nWho is at risk of placenta accreta?\nSome risk factors that cause pregnant mothers to develop placenta accreta include:\nPregnant mothers with placenta previa: Research shows that about 1-5% of pregnant mothers with placenta previa without old incisions on the uterine body are at risk of developing RCRL.; Pregnant mothers with old incisions on the uterine body (due to cesarean section, uterine fibroid removal surgery...): Pregnant mothers with placenta previa with old incisions on the uterine body will increase the risk of placenta accreta. according to the number of surgeries; History of surgery or curettage in the uterine cavity: This is the cause that directly affects the uterus, causing scarring, weakening the uterus, and affecting pregnancy.\nThe incidence of the disease increases with the rate of cesarean delivery\n\nSymptoms of placenta accreta\nPlacenta accreta does not cause any obvious symptoms or signs, only in the last months of pregnancy (third trimester) is abnormal vaginal bleeding discovered.\nâ€œCurrently, with the development of modern ultrasound systems, it is possible to help detect this condition early. Therefore, pregnant mothers need to comply with the regular prenatal check-up schedule as prescribed by the doctor, monitor the pregnancy closely, detect early and intervene effectively in cases of placenta accreta,\" Dr. Phan The Thi recommended.\n\nIs placenta accreta dangerous?\nAlthough it is a rare condition, placenta accreta is very dangerous, causing many life-threatening complications for the pregnant mother and the fetus. After giving birth, the placenta cannot automatically separate from the uterine wall, causing bleeding that cannot be stopped, leading to many dangerous complications such as postpartum hemorrhage requiring a blood transfusion, threatening the life of the pregnant mother.\nRetained placenta can cause postpartum infection. Forced to give birth prematurely due to heavy bleeding from the pregnant mother while the fetus is still premature, causing many consequences of premature birth such as respiratory failure, infection, jaundice, difficulty feeding, etc., and even being born too prematurely can cause premature birth. can cause death.\nPremature babies born to mothers with placenta accreta are at risk of many serious health problems\nIn cases where placenta accreta invades the bladder or rectum, sometimes part of the bladder or rectum must be removed to stop the bleeding. In many cases, hysterectomy is required, affecting the woman's ability to become pregnant and become a mother.\n\nMethod of diagnosing placenta accreta\nDr. Phan The Thi said that currently, with the development of modern medicine and the support of state-of-the-art machinery systems, placenta accreta can be detected early and accurately diagnosed right in pregnancy. period. Available diagnostic methods include:\nUltrasound: The ultrasound method of placenta accreta helps detect this condition early as well as its dangerous progression.; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): In case the ultrasound method is not suitable, the doctor will prescribe the pregnant mother an MRI to give the most accurate diagnostic results.\nHowever, in many cases, we have to wait until the end of the birth without seeing the placenta naturally separate before we can accurately diagnose the condition of placenta accreta.\nTherefore, to ensure a healthy pregnancy and a safe labor process, it is recommended that pregnant mothers choose a medical facility with a strong obstetrics unit, gathering a team of highly qualified and experienced experts. Practical experience, equipped with modern machinery systems and the world's most advanced treatment intervention regimens to ensure safety for both mother and child in any situation.\n\nHow to handle placenta accreta\nDepending on the health condition of the pregnant mother, the location of the placenta, the degree of invasion of the placenta into the uterine wall, etc., the doctor will advise and prescribe appropriate treatment. (4)\n1. For cases where placenta accreta is diagnosed proactively before birth\nIn case the placenta is discovered to be attached too deeply, too tightly and invades nearby organs such as the intestines, bladder... the doctor will prescribe a cesarean section and possibly a hysterectomy to stop the bleeding.\nIn case the placenta is slightly invasive, the doctor will prescribe a cesarean section and remove the detached part of the placenta. The remaining part of the placenta in the uterus will be treated with medication to cause it to regress.\nIt can be said that giving birth to a pregnant mother with the disease is considered a difficult surgery, therefore requiring highly skilled obstetricians to minimize risks. The Center for Obstetrics and Gynecology of Tam Anh General Hospital System has successfully saved many cases of pregnant mothers experiencing obstetric complications during pregnancy on the old cesarean section, ensuring safety for pregnant mother and fetus.\nReference: How many weeks before surgery for placenta accreta?\nDoctors at the Center for Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City are performing a cesarean section for a pregnant mother with severe placenta accreta.\nSee details of a successful surgery case with complications of uterine rupture and placenta accreta in a pregnant mother with old surgical scars here.\n2. For cases where placenta accreta is diagnosed after birth\nAfter the baby is born and the placenta does not detach automatically, doctors will make a diagnosis. Based on the level of placental adhesion as well as the health condition of the pregnant mother, the doctor will prescribe specific treatment.\nIn case the placenta invades later and spreads to neighboring organs, the doctor may prescribe partial removal of those organs. In many cases, hysterectomy is required to ensure the life of the pregnant mother.\n\nHow to prevent placenta accreta\nPlacenta accreta causes many dangerous complications for pregnant mother and fetus. Therefore, pregnant mothers need to plan to prevent this condition by:\nHave a suitable birth plan, appropriate spacing between pregnancies, minimize cesarean section.; Limit abortion or uterine surgery; Regular prenatal checkups as prescribed by your doctor to closely monitor your pregnancy.\nDoctor II Phan The Thi, Doctor of Obstetrics and Gynecology Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, has many years of experience and is ready to accompany pregnant mothers in closely monitoring pregnancy and avoiding dangerous obstetric complications.\nOne of the ways to reduce the risk of placenta accreta in future pregnancies is for pregnant mothers to give birth vaginally instead of cesarean section if a doctor's indication for cesarean section is not available.\nIf the pregnancy is healthy and the fetus is developing well, it is recommended that pregnant women continue the pregnancy until natural labor begins. You should not choose a cesarean section on request for a reason not related to your health, for example, because you want to give birth on a good day, you should choose a cesarean section earlier than your due date.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the cesarean section rate should be limited to less than 15% to avoid causing dangerous complications for pregnant mothers and fetuses. However, statistics show that in recent years the cesarean section rate in Vietnam has been increasing rapidly.\nAccording to a survey measuring indicators of Vietnam's Sustainable Development Goals for Children and Women (SDGGW) in 2020-2021, the cesarean section rate in our country accounts for 34.4%, an increase of nearly 7%. compared to 2014. The rate of cesarean section in urban areas is also higher, accounting for 43.2%, raising concerns about the abuse of this technique causing many complications affecting the health of pregnant mothers and fetuses. .\nIn case the pregnant mother is forced to have a cesarean section as prescribed by the doctor for health reasons, it is necessary to comply with a minimum interval of 2 years between births from the time of the first uterine intervention. This is a certain waiting period to help the pregnant mother fully recover after the surgery, as well as the best time to ensure the development of the fetus and the safety of the pregnant mother during pregnancy.\nPregnant mothers with old incisions need to be equipped with knowledge of pregnancy care and monitoring. Be alert for unusual symptoms during pregnancy such as dull abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, uterine contractions... and go to the hospital for a checkup immediately. Pregnant mothers can register to participate in prenatal classes to be provided with a lot of useful information and practical instructions in pregnancy care and monitoring.\nInvested in building spacious facilities, possessing a modern machinery system, gathering a team of skilled, experienced and skilled Obstetrics and Gynecology experts in applying advanced treatment regimens. most in the world... Tam Anh General Hospital System's Obstetrics and Gynecology Center provides full maternity services, full childbirth, on-demand maternity services... for all pregnant mothers from the beginning of pregnancy to birth. delivery, complete examination steps and close pregnancy monitoring, ensuring a healthy pregnancy, safe birth, and a healthy mother and baby.\nComing to the Obstetrics and Gynecology Center of Tam Anh General Hospital System, pregnant mothers will receive advice and direct pregnancy monitoring by leading experts in the field of Obstetrics and Gynecology in Vietnam, helping pregnant mothers have more Lots of useful knowledge in pregnancy care, ensuring safety and health for both mother and child.\nFor advice and to make an appointment with Obstetrics and Gynecology experts at Tam Anh General Hospital System, pregnant mothers and their families please contact:\nHopefully the above useful information will help pregnant mothers gain more knowledge about placenta accreta.
