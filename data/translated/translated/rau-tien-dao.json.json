    "content": "Placenta praevia: Causes, signs and prevention\n\nPlacenta praevia is one of the dangerous pregnancy complications that threatens the life of pregnant women and their fetuses with an incidence of 1/200 cases of pregnant women. So what are the signs of placenta previa for pregnant mothers to recognize early and treat effectively?\n\nWhat is placenta praevia?\nPlacenta previa is a phenomenon in which the placenta is located in the lowest position of the uterus, partially or completely covering the cervix, blocking the exit of the fetus during childbirth.\nDuring pregnancy, the placenta (also known as the placenta) is the only metabolic part between the pregnant woman and the fetus, providing nutrients to nourish the fetus. The placenta is formed very early, parallel to the development of the fetus.\nAssociate Professor, Dr. Nguyen Duc Hinh, Center for Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, said that normally the placenta attaches to the front, back or top of the uterine wall, on the left or right side of the uterus. bow. The placenta is round in shape, about 15cm in diameter, about 2.5-3cm thick, and weighs about 400-500g (estimated about ⅙ of the fetus's weight). Each placenta consists of 15-20 segments, between the segments are small grooves. (first)\n\nCommon forms of placenta praevia\nBased on the location of the placenta, the disease is divided into 5 types, including:\nLow placed placenta: The placenta is attached to the body of the uterus and a small part in the lower uterine segment, not reaching the uterine opening.; Placenta accreta: The edge of the placenta adheres to the cervix, not covering the cervix; Lateral placenta: Most of the placenta is attached to the lower segment but has not reached the cervix.; Semi-central placenta previa: The placenta partially covers the cervix; Central placenta previa: The placenta completely covers the cervix, accounting for 20-30% of cases. (2)\n\n\n\n\nCauses of placenta praevia\nCurrently, the cause of placenta previa has not been clearly determined. Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that the placenta can develop in any position where the embryo nests in the uterus. That is, if the embryo implants in the lower part of the uterus, the placenta will develop from this position, not moving upward during pregnancy, resulting in placenta previa.\nIn addition, people with the following factors are at high risk of experiencing this condition, including:\nWomen who have gone through childbirth multiple times;; Women who become pregnant at an older age (over 35 years old);; History of previous miscarriages or abortions;; Had uterine infection before pregnancy;; History of placenta previa in previous pregnancy;; The uterus has an abnormal shape;; Women pregnant with twins or multiples with large placentas will be at increased risk of disease;; Unhealthy lifestyle, frequent use of stimulants such as smoking.\n\nSigns of placenta praevia are common\nSymptoms of placenta previa vary depending on the clinical form and the severity of the disease. In general, pregnant women can early recognize placenta if they experience symptoms of placenta previa during pregnancy: (3)\nAbnormal vaginal bleeding (blood is bright red, possibly mixed with blood clots) but does not cause pain, common in the last 3 months of pregnancy.; Vaginal bleeding can range from mild to severe, with light or heavy bleeding and can go away on its own without treatment. However, symptoms may recur with increasing levels of bleeding.; In some cases, pregnant women experience bleeding along with contractions.\nAbnormal vaginal bleeding during pregnancy is one of the symptoms of placenta previa\nIf there is abnormal vaginal bleeding during pregnancy, especially in the second or last 3 months of pregnancy, the pregnant woman needs to go to the hospital immediately for proper and effective intervention and treatment to avoid the situation. Severe blood loss affects the life of the pregnant woman and the fetus.\n\nIs placenta praevia dangerous?\nIf placenta previa is not detected early and treated effectively, it can cause bleeding complications after giving birth and during pregnancy, threatening the life of both the mother and the fetus. Detail:\nFor pregnant women\nWhen the disease causes vaginal bleeding to recur many times during pregnancy, it can cause the pregnant woman to have severe anemia and easily give birth prematurely.\nIn the case of a pregnant woman with placenta attached near the cervix, after giving birth, the placenta is dissected, causing the cervix to open, creating favorable conditions for harmful bacteria and germs to penetrate and cause infection. In many cases, a hysterectomy is required if the placenta is tightly attached to the uterine muscle and cannot be separated from the mucosa.\nFor the fetus\nPregnant women with anemia can cause the fetus to be malnourished and not nourished, causing fetal distress. In cases where a pregnant woman has serious bleeding that requires emergency treatment, the doctor will prescribe an emergency cesarean section to save the lives of both the pregnant woman and the fetus. If the fetus is not yet full term, it will be born prematurely and there is a risk of postpartum respiratory failure if there is no supportive intervention.\nIn addition, the placenta is located below the uterus, making it difficult for the fetus to turn its head down, causing disadvantages for the fetus's exit during childbirth. Pregnant women may have to give birth in a breech position (transverse or breech position).\n\nHow many weeks will it take to find out placenta praevia?\nDoctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that most cases of placenta previa can be detected as early as the 20th week of pregnancy thanks to fetal ultrasound. During the ultrasound process, with the support of many modern equipment, the doctor can observe where in the uterus the placenta is attached (body, fundus, front, back, left, right). , low grip, semi-central or central).\nDiagnosis of placenta previa is mainly performed by ultrasound\n“During pregnancy, if an unlucky woman gets placenta previa, it will be very dangerous to the health of the mother and baby during pregnancy. Therefore, pregnant women need to strictly follow the doctor's prenatal examination schedule to detect abnormalities early in pregnancy and intervene promptly and effectively,\" Dr. Nguyen Duc Hinh emphasized.\n\nMethod of diagnosing placenta praevia\nUsually, the diagnosis is made using ultrasound. In addition, ultrasound is also important in diagnosing placenta previa, complications of placenta accreta. (4)\nUltrasound images will show that the distance between the placenta and the bladder wall is narrowed, blood vessels passing through the uterine muscle wall to the bladder wall are common on Doppler ultrasound. Therefore, ultrasound is recommended to be performed after the 28th week of pregnancy to detect this complication early.\n\nHow to treat placenta praevia?\nDoctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said, the general principle when treating placenta previa is to immediately stop the bleeding to save the pregnant woman's life. Depending on the age of the fetus, the level of bleeding, the ability to nourish the fetus and many other factors, the doctor will prescribe an appropriate continuation of the pregnancy or cesarean section.\nDepending on each specific case, the doctor will advise and prescribe appropriate treatment\nFor placenta previa when not in labor\nPregnant women need to have a reasonable rest regime, limit movement and exercise, and build a nutritional regimen that provides enough necessary nutrients for the body.; Doctors may prescribe pregnant women to use tocolytic drugs such as Spasmaverin, Salbutamol, Progesterone.; Using Corticoids helps mature the fetal lungs in cases at risk of premature birth (from 24 weeks to 34 weeks 6 days).; For full-term pregnancy: If placenta previa is central or semi-central, the doctor will prescribe an elective cesarean section at 38 weeks. In the remaining cases, consider continuing to monitor until labor occurs if there is no bleeding.; In case of heavy bleeding or anemia that threatens the life of the pregnant woman: Caesarean section is indicated at any gestational age to stop the bleeding to save the mother.\nFor placenta previa during labor\nIn case of semi-central or central placenta: The doctor prescribes a cesarean section; In case of low placenta: If there is a lot of bleeding, cesarean section is indicated; if there is little bleeding or no bleeding, continue to monitor labor.; In case of placenta accumulating: If there is heavy bleeding, a cesarean section is indicated. If the bleeding is light and the fetus and uterus are in a favorable position, the amnion will be compressed and the amniotic membrane torn toward the side without the placenta to stop the bleeding. If after tearing the amniotic membrane there is still bleeding, then perform a cesarean section; otherwise, if there is no more bleeding, then follow the vaginal route.\nFor placenta previa, complications of placenta accreta\nPlacenta accreta is considered the most serious complication of placenta previa. At this time, blood vessels have proliferated in the lower part of the uterus and begin to penetrate the bladder, often seen in pregnant women with old cesarean section incisions. The surgery is difficult, takes a lot of blood and can cause damage to the bladder.\nIn this case, the doctor will prescribe an active cesarean section when the pregnancy is full term by incision along the uterine body from above the placenta or the bottom of the uterus to remove the fetus. Do not remove the placenta and have a hysterectomy to minimize bleeding. These are extremely difficult and dangerous cases.\n\nPrevention of placenta praevia\nPlacenta previa is one of the dangerous pregnancy complications, threatening the life of both the mother and the fetus. Therefore, doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh recommends that pregnant women should note the following to enjoy a healthy and safe pregnancy. (5)\nDetail:\nLimit pregnancy when you are older. If pregnant, consult your doctor for advice and instructions on a close pregnancy monitoring schedule to best protect your pregnancy.; Follow your doctor's instructions after cesarean section to avoid causing dangerous complications in the old surgery wound.; Follow a healthy lifestyle, do not use stimulants during pregnancy.; Do not smoke, and avoid passive smoking during pregnancy.; Hospitalization for pregnancy monitoring if diagnosed with placenta previa in the last months of pregnancy.; Immediately go to a medical facility with a famous Obstetrics specialty to receive timely and effective intervention when the above abnormal signs appear.\nPregnant women should not use stimulants, especially smoking\nIn short, placenta previa is a dangerous pregnancy complication. Diagnosis and treatment of the disease need to be carried out at a medical facility with a reputable Obstetrics department, a team of good and highly specialized doctors, and a full range of modern machinery and equipment to ensure safety for the fetus. mother and fetus.\nObstetrics and Gynecology Center, Tam Anh General Hospital System owns a system of modern machinery and equipment such as 2D, 3D, 4D ultrasound systems, color Doppler ultrasound, advanced GE E10 ultrasound... for realistic, clear ultrasound images; brings together a team of leading experts in the field of Obstetrics in Vietnam, who have successfully treated many cases of dangerous obstetric complications, taking care of healthy pregnancies, safe births, and healthy mothers and babies.\nTo schedule a pregnancy examination and consultation with skilled obstetricians at Tam Anh General Hospital System, pregnant women please contact:\nHopefully the above useful information will help pregnant women better understand placenta previa.
