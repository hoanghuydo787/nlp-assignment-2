    "content": "Anal fistula – Causes, symptoms and diagnosis\n\nIf anal fistula is not treated promptly and properly, it can develop into a complicated fistula and increase the risk of anal-rectal cancer - According to Doctor Nguyen Quoc Thai, Doctor of Gastroenterology, Internal Medicine Center. Gastrointestinal endoscopy and endoscopic surgery, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City. Although not as common as hemorrhoids and stomach ulcers, anal fistula is a gastrointestinal disease that causes inconvenience to daily life, reduces confidence and is difficult to completely treat. More seriously, anal fistula can also be a condition of digestive cancer or a prolonged fistula itself is a risk factor for anal-rectal cancer. But people's awareness of this disease in Vietnam is still very limited. Most cases of anal fistula come to the hospital for examination when the condition has progressed for a long time, greatly affecting daily life and health because this is a disease of a sensitive area. Early examination and treatment of anal fistula has received almost no attention. In order to bring official and scientific information to people about anal fistula disease, Tam Anh General Hospital wrote the article under the professional advice of a specialist in Gastroenterology - Nguyen Quoc Thai, Invite readers to follow along!\nAnal fistula is a benign disease but can be caused by cancer or progress to cancer\n\nWhat is anal fistula?\nAnal fistula (also known as eel vein) is a condition where there is an abnormal tunnel connection between the anal canal and the skin around the anus. This is often the result of an abscess (pus) in the anorectal area that is left untreated or does not completely heal. An abscess occurs when the small mucus-producing glands located just inside the anus become clogged and infected. About 40% of these abscesses may develop into fistulas. However, leakage can also be due to other causes. (first)\n\nCauses of anal fistula\nIn addition to the cause of anal abscess, fistula can be due to causes such as:\nCrohn's disease (enteritis); Radiation (cancer treatment); Injury; Foreign body in anal area; Sexually transmitted diseases; Tuberculosis; Cancer; Effects after surgery in the area near the anus\nDoctor Thai shared that anal fistula can also be a manifestation of a malignant condition but few people are aware of this. Most patients are very subjective if the symptoms do not seriously affect their health and daily life.\n\nSymptoms of anal fistula\nAnal fistula may present with symptoms including:\nPain and swelling around the anus; Bloody or foul-smelling discharge (pus) from a hole around the anus. The pain may decrease after the fistula has drained.; Skin irritation around the anus due to fluid leaking out; Pain during defecation; Anal bleeding.; The infection can cause fever, chills and a feeling of fatigue.\n“When there are signs of suspected anal fistula as above, the patient needs to immediately go to the hospital for examination. Because the fistula progresses for a long time, it can become a complex fistula, meaning there are many different nooks and crannies, making it difficult to treat completely.\" - Dr. Thai recommended.\n\nMethods of diagnosing anal fistula\nPatients can have their doctor diagnose an anal fistula by examining the area around the anus to find a fistula and examining the rectum with a finger to look for a fibrous fistula. In addition, patients may need additional tests such as:\nTransanal ultrasound: the doctor will use a finger-shaped ultrasound probe into the anus to evaluate the fistula.; Pelvic MRI: helps detect fistulas and evaluate whether the fistula is simple or complex to plan treatment; X-ray of the fistula: using contrast material injected into the fistula to help show the fistula on film\nIn addition, once a fistula has been detected, the patient may need to do additional tests to find the cause of the disease such as tuberculosis, cancer... Further tests the patient may need to perform may include:\nBlood tests; colonoscopy\nThe endoscopy room of Tam Anh General Hospital is fully equipped with modern equipment\n\nMethods of treating anal fistula\nSurgery is the main method used today in the treatment of anal fistula. In cases where an anal fistula is determined to be a condition of digestive cancer, the doctor needs to consult to choose the most optimal treatment methods based on the specific type of cancer the patient is suffering from, for example For example, anal cancer or rectal cancer...\nIf an anal fistula is not caused by digestive cancer, the doctor may recommend immediate surgery. In addition, after surgery, patients can soak in a warm bath to reduce pain symptoms and use stool softeners to ease bowel movements.\nIn addition to fistula surgery, patients can choose laser treatment. With this method, the doctor inserts a small laser into the fistula and burns it, helping to heal the wound. Patients need to see a doctor to advise on which method is appropriate. (2)\n\nMeasures to prevent recurrence of anal fistula after surgery\nAnal fistula can still recur after surgery if the patient does not strictly comply with treatment and does not have a proper care, living, and eating regimen. Doctor Thai advises that after surgery, patients need to soak their anus regularly so that the wound heals from the bottom up; You should continue to take medication as prescribed by your doctor; should exercise gently; Eat easy-to-digest foods rich in fiber in the first days after surgery for easy digestion; Avoid spicy, hot foods, etc.\nAfter recovery, the patient needs to continue to maintain a scientific diet and lifestyle; Do not drink alcohol or beer; Avoid constipation which can harm your anus. In particular, patients should have regular check-ups to detect early anal and rectal abnormalities that may occur.\n\nFrequently asked questions about anal fistula\nDuring the specialized treatment process, we receive a number of questions from patients about anal fistula and would like to answer each specific question as follows:\n1. Is anal fistula dangerous?\nAnal fistula is usually a benign disease, only causing discomfort and making the patient lose confidence. Although anal fistula is not life-threatening, it requires a reasonable treatment process with patient compliance.\nIf anal fistula is a complication of a type of digestive cancer, this case is especially dangerous. Because digestive cancers, if detected late, often have a poor prognosis with low quality of life.\n2. How long does it take for anal fistula surgery to heal?\nIn simple cases of anal fistula surgery, the patient can be discharged from the hospital in just 2-3 days and after 4-6 weeks the wound will heal completely. For complex surgical cases, the hospital stay and recovery time may be longer, depending on the condition and post-operative care.\n3. Are there any complications after anal fistula surgery?\nAfter anal fistula surgery, if not abstinent and treated properly, complications can occur such as anal bleeding, pus infection, and recurrent fistula. In addition, there may be complications of incontinence (fecal incontinence, gas), depending on the surgeon's skill and the disease condition.\nAfter surgery, complications such as anal bleeding or pus infection may occur\n4. Can anal fistula be cured?\nSurgery can help completely cure anal fistula with proper intervention and care.\nHaving any gastrointestinal health condition is cause for concern, not just anal fistula. It is important that each person needs to improve disease prevention before it happens by having a healthy, scientific diet, lifestyle, and exercise. At the same time, keep the habit of going to the hospital for regular health check-ups and screenings (preferably every 6 months) to early detect possible abnormalities, including anal fistula - Dr. Thai emphasize.\nTo learn about the cost of examination and SCHEDULE ANAL FISTAKE TREATMENT, please contact: Tam Anh Hanoi General Hospital System: 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Bo De Ward, Long Bien District, Hanoi City .
