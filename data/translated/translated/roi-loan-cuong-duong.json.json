    "content": "Erectile dysfunction: Causes, symptoms, treatment and prevention\n\nErectile dysfunction is a secret obsession of many men. Although the disease does not pose a danger to health, it takes away a man's confidence and bravery towards his partner. Proactive treatment early when you notice signs of the disease will help men quickly recover this physiological function. According to statistics in the US, up to 20 million men have erectile dysfunction. The incidence of complete or partial erectile dysfunction is more than 50% in men aged 40-70 years. About 100 million Asian men suffer from varying degrees of erectile dysfunction and this is the most common male disease in men.\n\nWhat is erectile dysfunction?\nErectile dysfunction is a condition in which the penis is not hard enough or unable to maintain an erection to fully perform satisfactory sexual activity. This condition is one of the manifestations of erectile dysfunction in men. (first)\nErection phenomenon is an extremely complex physiological process, with the participation of the nervous, mental, endocrine systems, blood vessels, structure of the penis... to bring more blood to the corpora cavernosa for erection. hard object. Therefore, any obstacle in this process, even the smallest, at the molecular level can cause erectile dysfunction.\nTherefore, erectile dysfunction can be caused by one or a combination of many different causes. The five main causes of erectile dysfunction are: hormonal, neurological, mental, penile vascular system and abnormalities in penile structure. In addition, pelvic and genital trauma and medication are also common causes.\nThere are 2 types of erectile dysfunction:\nPrimary erectile dysfunction: is a patient who has never achieved or maintained a penile erection.; Secondary erectile dysfunction: the patient's penis is normally erect, but at some point it does not reach the desired hardness.\n\nHow does erectile dysfunction manifest?\nPeople with erectile dysfunction will have signs such as: (2)\nLoss of sexual desire. The penis is soft and cannot meet the normal physiological needs of the partner; Men still have the desire to have intercourse. However, when interacting with women, despite using many stimulation methods, the penis cannot become erect; Appearance of erratic erection of the penis, not according to the needs of men.; ● Although the penis is erect, it does not last long enough to have sex. In some cases, when the penis is inserted into a woman's body, it softens on its own, causing excitement to quickly disappear.\n\nCauses of erectile dysfunction\nMost erectile dysfunction is related to vascular, neurological, psychological and hormonal disorders. Drug use is also a cause. Primary erectile dysfunction has a low rate and is caused by abnormalities or congenital abnormalities of the body.\nPsychological factors play an important role in causing erectile dysfunction, so they are often considered in all cases of erectile dysfunction. The patient may experience depression or anxiety, stress in personal life, feelings of guilt or fear of not wanting to have sex... These psychological factors can be completely resolved by a doctor or doctor. Psychologist, mentally relieving patients.\n70% of erectile dysfunction cases come from the following physical causes: (3)\nDiseases that affect blood vessels and limit blood flow to the penis such as: diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure or increased blood cholesterol... The most common is penile cavernous atherosclerosis, caused by suctioning medications and diabetes. Atherosclerosis, accompanied by natural degeneration, reduces the ability of arteries to relax and smooth muscle in the vessel walls, reducing the amount of blood entering the penis. Use of trazodone, heroin, alcohol, and sickle cell disease can cause penile fibrosis, which reduces the blood flow needed to the penis for an erection.; Causes that reduce nerve conduction from the central nervous system to the penis such as: multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord pathology, peripheral and autonomic nervous diseases.; Endocrine disorders: decreased testosterone in the blood (male menopause), increased prolactin secreted by the pituitary gland, hypothyroidism...; Complications of pelvic surgery such as cancer treatment, prostatectomy, radical cystectomy; transurethral resection of the prostate; rectal cancer surgery...; Trauma: brain, spinal cord, pelvis...; Some medications to treat high blood pressure, diuretics, antiarrhythmics, antidepressants, sedatives...; Depression.; Prolonged pelvic pressure (eg, cycling too much)\n\nMethods of diagnosing erectile dysfunction\n1. Medical history examination\nA medical history examination will help the doctor understand the nature, timing and severity of erectile dysfunction. Thereby, doctors can identify psychosexual factors, physical causes and help determine the patient's expectations.\n2. Test erectile function\nThe doctor checks whether the patient is still able to have an erection at night or in the morning. This is important because it is considered the ability to achieve penile erection under different circumstances.\n3. Set of assessment questions\nPatients will answer 15 questions in the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire including:\n6 sentences about erectile function of the penis.; 2 sentences about pleasure.; 2 sentences about sexual desire.; 3 sentences about sexual satisfaction; 2 sentences about comprehensive satisfaction.\n4. Assess the level of erectile dysfunction\nSeverity level: 6 – 20 points; Average level: 21 – 30 points; Mild level: 31 – 50 points; No disorder: 51 – 60 points\n5. Physical examination\n5.1. Clinical examination\nGenitals:\nExamination of the penis: Size and shape.; Abnormalities of the glans and foreskin; Signs of Peyronie's disease.; Testicular examination: Number, size, location, properties.\nSecondary sexual characteristics:\nThe patient's physical condition; Gynecomastia condition.; Hair condition.; Fat distribution in the body.\nCheck the vascular system: Review and evaluate blood pressure.\n5.2. Subclinical\nTesting patients to diagnose diabetes, hyperlipidemia and endocrine disorders; Conduct color Doppler ultrasound of penile blood vessels.; Perform cavernous imaging combined with measuring cavernous blood vessel pressure; Perform penile angiography.\n\nRisk factors affecting erectile dysfunction\nAs you get older, your penis becomes less erect.\nSome risk factors that can cause erectile dysfunction include:\nPeople suffering from certain medical conditions such as diabetes or heart disease; People who smoke regularly. This habit will restrict blood flow to the veins and arteries, which over time can cause chronic diseases leading to erectile dysfunction.; People who are overweight or obese; People who have undergone certain medical treatments such as prostate surgery, cancer radiation therapy, etc.; People with penile injury, especially when the injury affects the nerves or arteries that control erections.; People being treated with medications including antidepressants, antihistamines, high blood pressure medications, and benign prostatic hyperplasia medications.; People who regularly use drugs and alcohol. Erectile dysfunction is especially serious for long-term drug users or heavy drinkers.; People with psychological problems such as frequent stress, anxiety or depression.\n\nErectile dysfunction and diabetes\nFor patients with diabetes, erectile dysfunction will appear early due to many causes. The longer a patient has diabetes, the higher the rate of erectile dysfunction. Other factors such as age, alcohol consumption, poor blood sugar control, vascular complications... can all potentially increase the risk.\nThe rate of erectile dysfunction in diabetics is 15-18 times higher than in non-diabetic groups of the same age. Evidence from any source\nEarly detection of erectile dysfunction will help diabetic patients shorten the recovery time for this physiological function. Most diabetics have erectile dysfunction due to a combination of factors such as endocrine, nervous, vascular, and mental. Therefore, the treatment of erectile dysfunction in diabetic patients needs to affect multiple risk factors, comprehensively control complications, and coordinate with multispecialties including:\nChange diet and lifestyle: Stop smoking and drinking alcohol; increase physical activity and adopt a healthy diet; Adjusting blood glucose: The doctor will give the patient oral medication or insulin injections.; Treatment of vascular complications: Patients will need to adjust cholesterol, use vasodilator, anti-embolic and anti-atherosclerotic drugs; Treatment of neurological and mental complications (if any); Using treatment measures such as: Patients can receive Testosterone replacement therapy, 5-Phosphodiesterase inhibitors...\n\nTreatment of erectile dysfunction\nTreat the underlying causes and underlying diseases, if any, such as diabetes, Pituitary Tumor, Andropause, Cavernosal Fibrosis... Drugs that are temporarily related to the onset of erectile dysfunction should be treated. discontinue or replace.; Non-invasive methods such as Contraction Rings (For people who cannot maintain an erection long enough) or Vacuum Erection Devices (a vacuum device that pulls blood into the penis through a suction action, then a Elastic ring is placed at the base of the penis to maintain an erection). Disadvantages of this method are penis bruising, cold tip of the penis, and lack of naturalness. If necessary, these tools can be combined with medication.; Treatment is with medication, usually oral phosphodiesterase inhibitors. These drugs control smooth muscle relaxation. In comparative clinical trials, these drugs showed an efficacy of  60 – 75%.; Prostaglandin E1 intracavernous or urethral injection:  Alprostadil (prostaglandin E1), self-administered by penile cavernosal injection or urethral insertion, can produce an erection with an average duration of 30’ to 1 hour.; If other treatment methods fail, surgery to replace the artificial cavernous material may be considered.\n1. How to treat with oral medication?\nRecently, some drugs that help treat erectile dysfunction become simple, non-invasive, highly effective (75 - 80%) and have few side effects are phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors. Currently, there are three groups of commonly used PDE-5 inhibitors: sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil.\n1.1 Effects and effectiveness of the drug\nThese drugs increase blood flow into the penis, helping the patient get an erection. The medicine begins to work and creates the necessary erection after only 10 - 30 minutes of taking it\n1.2 Side effects\nDizziness, headache, facial redness, runny nose, hypotension, visual abnormalities, hearing loss; Indigestion and stomach upset may occur in some cases.; Do not use PDE-5 inhibitors with nitrate drugs (treatment of coronary artery disease). All PDE5 inhibitors cause coronary vasodilation, enhancing the hypotensive effects of other nitrates, including those used to treat coronary artery disease as well as inhaled amyl nitrate (popularly known today as poppers). ). Therefore, concurrent use of nitrates and PED5 inhibitors may be dangerous and should be avoided.\n2. Surgery to treat erectile dysfunction?\nIf medication and vacuum equipment fail, surgical implantation of a penile prosthesis - artificial cavernous body - can be considered.\nProsthetic implants consist of semi-rigid silicone rods and multi-component devices that can be inflated with saline. Both models have the common risks of anesthesia, infection, and graft rejection.\n\nPrevent erectile dysfunction\nMen, especially older men, need to build a healthy lifestyle to prevent the risk of erectile dysfunction such as:\nEat in moderation, live a healthy lifestyle.; Do not smoke, limit the use of alcoholic beverages; Maintain physical health by actively participating in physical activities or a sport.; Always maintain an optimistic spirit, limit letting sad factors affect and cause anxiety; Seek sympathy from your partner.; If you detect symptoms of the disease, you need to see a doctor as soon as possible for timely intervention.\nThe Center for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts in internal medicine and surgery, skilled and dedicated.

Currently, there are three groups of commonly used PDE-5 inhibitors: sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil.\n1.1 Effects and effectiveness of the drug\nThese drugs increase blood flow into the penis, helping the patient get an erection. The medicine begins to work and creates the necessary erection after only 10 - 30 minutes of taking it\n1.2 Side effects\nDizziness, headache, facial redness, runny nose, hypotension, visual abnormalities, hearing loss; Indigestion and stomach upset may occur in some cases.; Do not use PDE-5 inhibitors with nitrate drugs (treatment of coronary artery disease). All PDE5 inhibitors cause coronary vasodilation, enhancing the hypotensive effects of other nitrates, including those used to treat coronary artery disease as well as inhaled amyl nitrate (popularly known today as poppers). ). Therefore, concurrent use of nitrates and PED5 inhibitors may be dangerous and should be avoided.\n2. Surgery to treat erectile dysfunction?\nIf medication and vacuum equipment fail, surgical implantation of a penile prosthesis - artificial cavernous body - can be considered.\nProsthetic implants consist of semi-rigid silicone rods and multi-component devices that can be inflated with saline. Both models have the common risks of anesthesia, infection, and graft rejection."
