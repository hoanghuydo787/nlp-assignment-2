This sleep disorder can contribute to other health problems, and even has the potential to affect mental health.\nIn 1979, the American Sleep Disorders Association published the first classification system specifically for sleep disorders. Accordingly, there are more than 100 types of sleep disorders classified based on causes, symptoms, physiological and psychological effects and other criteria.\nHowever, most sleep disorders often have the following signs: (1)\nYou are sleepy but have difficulty going to sleep.; You have difficulty staying awake during the day.; You have an imbalance in your daily sleep-wake rhythm.; You have unusual behaviors that disrupt your sleep.\nAny of these signs may indicate that you have a sleep disorder. Depending on the symptoms of the disease, the doctor can advise the most appropriate treatment.\nWhat is sleep disorder? Patients often have difficulty staying awake during the day\n\nTypes of sleep disorders\nAmong the types of sleep disorders, below are the 6 most common diseases that we often suffer from:\nInsomnia\nInsomnia is a condition where it is difficult to fall asleep at night, repeatedly for many days. People with insomnia often experience excessive daytime sleepiness and are susceptible to other cognitive impairments while awake.\nIf this sleep disorder lasts a long time, occurring at least three times per week for at least three months, it is considered chronic insomnia. Currently, statistics from the National Sleep Foundation (USA) sleep research organization show that about ⅓ of adults \"live\" with insomnia.\nSleep apnea syndrome\nSleep apnea is also a sleep disorder that causes the patient to have upper airway obstruction every time they go to sleep. There are two main types of sleep apnea: obstructive apnea and central apnea. In addition, there is also mixed apnea which is a combination of the above two types.\nWhen falling asleep, the larynx will narrow, making it more difficult for air to circulate through the pharynx. At this time, the patient will snore to combat the above phenomenon. Or the patient may also stop breathing for a period of time (usually 10 seconds). (2)\nSleep apnea can cause the patient to stop breathing many times while sleeping and have absolutely no memory of this condition even if they wake up after each pause. Like other sleep disorders, sleep apnea can cause excessive sleepiness, fatigue, drowsiness, cognitive impairment, etc. during the day.\nNarcolepsy\nNarcolepsy is a sleep disorder that causes people to feel excessively tired during the day despite getting enough rest the night before. This condition causes you to always be in a state of \"sleepiness\" and may suddenly fall asleep during the day.\nNarcolepsy is a chronic disease that can lead to sudden loss of muscle tone over a short period of time. Narcolepsy and atonic attacks can occur in patients with tumors of the third ventricle and upper brainstem, traumatic brain injury, encephalitis, and Niemann-Pick disease.\nRestless legs syndrome (RLS)\nRestless Leg Syndrome (RLS, also known as Willis-Ekbom disease) is a type of sleep-related movement disorder. This condition causes the patient to feel itchy, painful, and uncomfortable in the legs and feel like they want to move their legs even while sleeping. (3)\nIn some cases, people with restless legs syndrome may also feel discomfort in their hands or other parts. Only when the foot moves can it feel more comfortable.\nThis sleep disorder is often mild in the morning and becomes more severe each night.\nRestless legs syndrome makes you constantly want to move while you sleep\nParasomnias\nParasomnias is a condition of \"false insomnia\" - a relatively common sleep disorder today. People with pseudoinsomnia may have unusual behaviors before falling asleep or during sleep. (4)\nSleepwalking, talking in sleep, moaning in sleep, having nightmares, wetting the bed, etc. are common behaviors of people with this sleep disorder. Symptoms of this sleep disorder often occur in children, but sometimes adults can also experience it.\nCircadian sleep disorder\nSleep rhythm disorder, also known as circadian rhythm sleep disorder, is a condition in which it is difficult to fall asleep, wake up too early but cannot go back to sleep, wake up during the sleep cycle, etc. Sleep disorder This includes forms such as: delayed sleep phase disorder, advanced sleep phase disorder, sleep disorder due to shift work, irregular sleep-wake rhythm, irregular sleep-wake syndrome 24 hours,…\nIn addition to the 6 types of sleep disorders mentioned above, there are many other types of sleep disorders such as idiopathic oversleeping, Kleine-Levin syndrome (sleeping beauty syndrome), sleep paralysis, etc.\n\nSymptoms of sleep disorders\nSymptoms of sleep disorders include extreme sleepiness during the day and difficulty sleeping at night. In addition, there are other symptoms depending on the type of sleep disorder you are experiencing.\nSome common signs of sleep disorders include: (5)\nSuddenly falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as while driving, in a meeting, at work, etc.; Feeling uncomfortable every time I try to fall asleep.; It usually takes you more than 30 minutes each night to fall asleep.; Have irregular sleep-wake cycles; Stop breathing, gasp for breath, snore loudly while sleeping.; Involuntary urination during sleep; Woke up in the middle of the night but couldn't go back to sleep.; Take short naps, wake up early.; Sleepwalking (getting out of bed and moving while still asleep).; Show signs of fear, crying, screaming, etc. even while sleeping.; In the evening and when you try to fall asleep, you have a crawling, tingling feeling in your legs or arms that is relieved when you move your legs.; Imagine loud explosions in your head if you wake up while sleeping.; Experiencing hallucinations at the onset of sleep or during the transition between sleep and wakefulness.; Can't remember the actions I did while sleeping.; Feeling completely numb as soon as I wake up.; Tired, tired and always feel sleepy, need to go to sleep during the day.; Irritability, anxiety, mood changes.; Decline in work and study performance; Lack of concentration.\nCommon symptoms of sleep disorders are fatigue and drowsiness during the day\n\nCauses of sleep disorders\nIn some cases, underlying health problems are the cause of sleep disorders. In addition, there are other causes such as:\nExperiencing medical conditions\nPeople with allergies, colds, respiratory infections or respiratory problems often have difficulty breathing at night and cannot breathe through their nose. This is the cause of sleep disorders.\nBesides, people with diseases such as cardiovascular disease, lung disease, stomach disease, etc. also have more difficulty falling asleep and cannot sleep deeply.\nFrequent urination\nThe cause of sleep disorders may be that you drink a lot of water before bed, leading to nocturia and frequent urination, disrupting sleep. In addition, people with hormonal imbalance and urinary tract and kidney diseases can also experience nighttime urination, causing sleep disturbances.\nChronic pain\nConstant pain can make it difficult to fall asleep and can even wake you up after you fall asleep. Some of the most common causes of chronic pain include:\nArthritis;; Migraine;; Back-ache;; Fibromyalgia;; …\nIn some cases, chronic pain can even be exacerbated by sleep disorders. For example, people with migraines often have difficulty falling asleep, and people with insomnia and poor sleep are also at higher risk of having migraines.\nChronic pain can lead to sleep disorders\nStress and anxiety\nStress and anxiety often have a negative impact on your sleep quality. You may have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.\nIn addition, people with stress and anxiety are also at risk of having nightmares and sleepwalking, which can disrupt your sleep.\nSide effects of some medications\nSome medications can cause side effects that can disrupt your sleep, such as making you sleep more than usual.\nGenetic\nStudies show that if your family members such as your father, mother, or siblings have sleep disorders, your risk of getting the disease is also higher.\nOther factors\nSeveral factors can contribute to sleep problems, such as:\nFrequently works night shifts; Jet lag syndrome: Sleep condition is affected due to moving quickly across time zones, the body has not yet adapted (usually happens when you travel or work in countries with large differences in zones). hours with the country you live in).; Unhealthy lifestyle, frequent use of tobacco, caffeine and alcohol, and use of stimulants.\n\nWho is at risk of sleep disorders?\nWho is at risk of sleep disorders?
