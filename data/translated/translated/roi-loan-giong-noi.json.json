    "content": "Voice disorders: Causes, signs and treatments\n\nDoctor Tran Thi Thuy Hang - Head of Ear, Nose and Throat Department, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, said that a weak voice, whispering, rough hoarseness, and broken breath are all signs of a voice disorder. Long-term voice abnormalities cause patients to have difficulty communicating, leading to feelings of guilt and low self-esteem. Having a clear, pure voice is something everyone desires. Understanding voice disorders as well as how to diagnose, treat, and prevent this condition will help you protect and take better care of your voice.\n\nWhat is a voice disorder?\nVoice Disorders or Dysphonia is a condition that causes the patient's voice to change differently than before. When experiencing this condition, the patient may notice changes in one or more voice characteristics, such as disturbances in frequency, intensity, timbre or voice quality.\n\nSome common voice disorders\n1. Laryngitis\nLaryngitis is one of the most common voice disorders\nLaryngitis occurs when the vocal cords become irritated and swollen, causing the patient to become hoarse or even lose their voice. Acute laryngitis is usually caused by an upper respiratory virus and lasts only a few weeks. Meanwhile, chronic laryngitis lasts longer and is mostly related to diseases such as chronic cough, asthma or gastroesophageal reflux.\n2. Vocal cord paralysis\nIn some cases, the vocal cords may be partially or completely paralyzed. The cause of this condition may be that the laryngeal nerve is affected by infection, trauma during surgery, stroke or cancer.\n3. Spasmodic dysphonia\nThis is a neurological disease that affects the functioning of the vocal cords, causing the muscles in the larynx to contract involuntarily. This can cause the voice to become shaky, broken, weak, hoarse...\n4. Polyps, fibroids or laryngeal cysts\nPolyps, fibrous nodules or laryngeal cysts are benign lesions of the vocal cords. The formation of these lesions affects the normal functioning of the vocal cords, causing changes in the voice.\n5. Laryngeal cancer\nLaryngeal cancer is a malignant tumor of the vocal cords, most commonly laryngeal carcinoma. This type of cancer can cause voice disorders, causing the voice to become hoarse and persistent, causing difficulty breathing. (first)\n\nSymptoms of voice disorders\nSymptoms of voice disorders are quite clear, you can immediately recognize unusual changes in the voice such as:\nVoice is shaky, intermittent, less stable; Weak, whispering voice; Voice sounds reluctant, tense or shrill; Voice is too high, too low or changes voice depending on time of day; Hoarseness; Lost voice.\n\nCauses of voice disorders\nWhen we talk, air from the lungs pushes up and passes through the vocal cords. The vocal cords are elastic folds of mucous membrane located inside the larynx. When air flows through, the vocal cords are pulled closer together, vibrating and creating sound.\nFor sound to come out normally when speaking, the vocal cords need to work smoothly inside the larynx. Anything that interferes with the movement or contact of the vocal cords can cause a voice disorder. Possible causes of this disorder include:\n1. Voice abuse\nExcessive use of the voice is the leading cause of voice disorders\nVoice overuse can also cause voice disorders. Vocal abuse is anything that strains or harms the vocal cords, such as talking too much, shouting, or coughing. Smoking and constantly clearing your throat are also vocal abuse behaviors.\nVocal abuse can cause the vocal cords to stretch, become fibrotic, or develop abnormal growths. These change the sounds that come out of the throat. In some cases, the vocal cords can rupture due to vocal abuse, causing bleeding and even loss of voice if not treated promptly.\n2. Abnormalities in laryngeal structure\nAbnormalities in the structure of the larynx can affect the voice. These abnormalities can be congenital (trochanteric membrane, vocal fold groove...) or acquired (laryngeal injury, narrow airway scar...)\n3. Inflammation and edema of the vocal cords\nSurgery, respiratory diseases, allergies, gastroesophageal reflux, chemical exposure, smoking, drinking too much alcohol, using certain medications, and vocal abuse can cause inflammation and swelling. inflammation, affecting the normal functioning of the vocal cords.\n4. Benign/malignant lesions in the larynx\nBenign lesions such as cysts, papillomas, granulomas, fibroids or polyps can form on the vocal cords, preventing normal vocal cord function.\nOn the other hand, malignant tumors can also develop in the larynx, causing voice disorders and many other symptoms such as sore throat, earache, lump in the throat, prolonged cough, difficulty breathing, weight loss...\n5. Problems with the nerves that control the voice\nSome conditions can affect the nerves that control the vocal cords, including multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, etc. Nerves can also be affected by previous surgeries.\n6. Hormonal disorders\nDisorders that affect thyroid hormones, sex hormones, and growth hormones can cause voice disorders.\n7. Psychological problems\nVoice characteristics can also be affected by psychological stressors or other psycho-psychological problems. Patients suspected of having a psychological voice disorder should see a psychologist or psychiatrist for examination, diagnosis and treatment. (2)\nMany risk factors can contribute to voice disorders, including:\nSmoking: Increases the risk of laryngeal cancer; Alcohol and caffeine addiction: Causes stimulation and dehydration of the vocal cords; Gastroesophageal reflux condition; Occupational diseases: Singers, actors, lecturers, business people; Living environment: Noisy, low humidity.\n\nMethods of diagnosing voice disorders\n1. Clinical examination\nDoctor Tran Thi Thuy Hang, Department of Ear - Nose - Throat, Tam Anh General Hospital is examining a patient with signs of voice disorder.\nThe doctor will ask about the symptoms the patient is experiencing as well as listen to the patient's pronunciation to evaluate the voice disorder.\nThe doctor may also perform a more thorough examination of the vocal functions of the larynx by performing a laryngoscopy.\nCommonly used laryngoscopy methods include:\nRigid laryngoscopy: The doctor uses a rigid laryngoscope to pass through the mouth and down the throat to observe the pharynx, larynx and other related structures.; Flexible laryngoscopy: The doctor uses a small endoscope to pass through the nose and down the throat to examine and examine this area. Endoscopy time is about 10 - 15 minutes.\nRigid and flexible endoscopy can be combined with stroboscopy of the larynx - which is to examine the larynx with a flashing light that captures slow moving images of the vocal cords to observe vibration and activity. opening and closing of the vocal cords. The stroboscopic endoscopy method plays an important role in diagnosing conditions that cause voice disorders, helping to significantly improve the accuracy of laryngeal diagnosis compared to endoscopic techniques using conventional light sources. .\n2. Paraclinical\nThe doctor may prescribe a number of necessary tests and paraclinical examinations to support the diagnosis of voice disorders such as:\nVoice sound analysis: Through analysis from specialized machines and equipment, doctors can measure abnormalities in the sounds produced by the vocal cords. Specifically, the doctor can analyze the voice, analyze the singing voice, measure the shape of the voice amplitude, measure the severity index of the pronunciation disorder, do the stress speaking test, and measure the voice impairment index using vocal software...; Laryngeal electromyography: To diagnose voice disorders caused by neurological diseases; Some diagnostic imaging tests such as MRI, CT scan... if necessary.\n3. Diagnose the cause of voice disorders\nPatients with physical damage to the vocal cords or functional pronunciation disorders such as: spasmodic voice disorder, vocal cord hypoactivity, vocal cord hyperactivity, pubertal voice disorder, psychological voice disorder...\n\nTreatment methods for voice disorders\nDepending on the cause of the voice disorder, the doctor will prescribe the most suitable treatment method for the patient. Dr. Thuy Hang shared that the principle of treating this condition is to preserve the maximum anatomical structure, restore laryngeal function, focus on treating the cause of voice disorders and take preventive measures to prevent it. prevent recurrence of the disorder. (3)\n1. Drug treatment (internal medicine treatment)\nSome causes of voice disorders can be effectively treated with medication. Some medications that may be used for this condition include:\nAntibiotics, antifungal drugs; Steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; Medicines to treat allergies; Medicines to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease; Medicines to treat neurological diseases that cause voice disorders\nMedicines to treat throat disorders can be administered orally, by injection, or by throat spray or laryngopharyngeal aerosol.\nPatients need to comply with the doctor's medication instructions and absolutely not change the dosage or use the medication without the doctor's consent.\n2. Speech-language therapy\nSpeech-language therapy, also known as voice training, is indicated in the following cases:\nFunctional voice disorders without physical damage to the vocal cords..; Voice disorders have physical damage that causes pronunciation dysfunction such as inflammation, fibrosis, cysts, vocal cord polyps...; Voice therapy before and after laryngeal surgery; Supports the treatment of voice disorders due to neurological causes.\n3. Surgery to treat voice disorders\nSurgical treatment of voice disorders\nIn some cases, doctors may recommend surgery to treat voice disorders when medical treatment and voice therapy do not bring positive results. Indicated cases are usually:\nBenign damage to the vocal cords due to voice abuse and other ineffective treatments; Abnormalities in the vocal cord structure that do not indicate conservative treatment: vocal folds, vocal cord cysts, vocal cord papillomas, trochlear membrane...; Voice disorder due to neurological causes, conservative treatment has been performed but has not been effective; Voice disorder due to serious injury, causing fracture or displacement of the laryngeal cartilage.\n\nHow to prevent voice disorders\nVoice is very important in each of our lives. If you know how to protect your voice, you will prevent voice disorders and keep your voice sweet and clear. Dr. Thuy Hang recommends that you do the following to protect your voice:\nAvoid overusing your voice: Limit shouting, stop the habit of clearing your throat, and only use your voice when necessary; Quit smoking. Smoking not only harms vocal cord tissue but also increases the risk of dangerous cancers.; Always keep your throat moist by drinking lots of water and fruit juice. Be sure to limit caffeine and alcohol because these drinks can make you more susceptible to dehydration. Try to adjust your home and workplace space to not be too dry, ideally the humidity is 30% or more.; Proactively prevent medical conditions that can cause voice disorders such as pharyngitis, laryngitis, gastroesophageal reflux, etc.\nVoice disorders due to excessive shouting or inflammatory conditions such as acute laryngitis are very common. Symptoms will usually resolve within 1-2 weeks.\nHowever, if hoarseness or changes in voice characteristics persist for more than 3 weeks, the patient cannot rule out dangerous diseases as the cause. Patients need to quickly go to reputable hospitals with doctors specializing in voice to have a laryngoscopy to find the cause, which can detect vocal cord damage and receive timely treatment to restore the voice.\nThe Ear - Nose - Throat Department of Tam Anh General Hospital is the first facility in Vietnam to apply the DIVAS sound analysis system and the German Xion stroboscopy system. These are leading advanced devices integrating many modern technologies to help early detect injuries to the vocal cords, accurately diagnose voice disorders and other injuries that diagnostic and endoscopic techniques cannot use. usually undetectable.\nIn particular, the German Xion endoscopy system and flexible endoscope are capable of fully observing the details in the patient's nasal passages, ears, throat and larynx, minimizing the feeling of pain and difficulty. bearable, suitable for both adults and children.\nNot only that, Tam Anh General Hospital is also home to a team of highly specialized and experienced medical doctors with extensive training abroad in the fields of Audiology, Otology, and Vestibular Medicine. , ensuring accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and shortening medical examination and treatment time for patients.\nIn addition, in case of necessity, the Ear - Nose - Throat Department always cooperates closely with other hospital specialties and leading experts from the departments of diagnostic imaging, endocrinology, and neurology. , oncology, surgery, pediatrics... to bring the highest treatment efficiency to patients.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of voice disorders as well as ENT problems with experienced experts of Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact: General Hospital System Tam Anh: Hanoi: 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Bo De Ward, Long Bien District, Hanoi City Hotline: 024 3872 3872 – 024 7106 6858“>024 3872 3872 – 024 7106 6858 Ho Chi Minh City: 2B Pho Quang, Ward 2 , Tan Binh District, Ho Chi Minh City Hotline: 0287 102 6789 – 093 180 6858“>0287 102 6789 – 093 180 6858 Fanpage: Tam Anh General Hospital Website: https://tamanhhospital.vn",

If you know how to protect your voice, you will prevent voice disorders and keep your voice sweet and clear.
