The average age of starting menstruation is 12 years old, it can start as early as 8 years old or as late as 16 years old.\nThe average menstrual cycle is 28 days, however in many cases cycles shorter than about 24 days or longer than about 38 days are still considered normal. Menstruation time is different for each person, usually 3-5 days. The amount of blood lost after each menstrual cycle is about 50-150ml.\n\nWhat is menstrual disorder?\nMenstrual disorders are abnormalities in a menstrual cycle, which can be manifested by an unstable number of menstrual days, and the amount of menstrual blood suddenly being more or less than normal cycles. (first)\nDoctor Lam Hoang Duy said that menstrual disorders can be a sign of a certain endocrine disease, so women should see a doctor as soon as there are signs to be examined to find the cause. , with timely intervention to avoid dangers to health as well as fertility.\nIrregular menstrual cycles, prolonged menstrual periods, more or less menstrual blood than usual... are manifestations of menstrual disorders.\n\nSigns of menstrual disorders\nA menstrual cycle is still considered regular if it varies only slightly from cycle to cycle. Menstrual disorders refer to the following situations: (2)\nThe interval between periods is less than 24 days or longer than 38 days.; Amenorrhea for 3 or more cycles; Menstrual bleeding suddenly becomes more or less than normal cycles.; Menstruation lasts more than 8 days; Abnormal bleeding or spotting between menstrual cycles, after sex or after menopause; During menstruation, you experience severe symptoms such as cramps, severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nCommon types of menstrual disorders\nIf you encounter one or more of the following situations, you may be experiencing menstrual disorders. (3)\n1. Menorrhagia\nMenstrual bleeding is considered heavy (menorrhagia) if it interferes with daily activities and work. Normally, the amount of blood lost during each period is about 50-150ml. If a woman loses a lot of blood, 10-25 times the normal amount of blood during each period, or has to constantly change sanitary napkins every hour instead of 3-4 times a day, that is menorrhagia.\nMenstrual disorders, if severe, can cause patients to have to temporarily stop daily activities and work just to deal with excessive menstrual blood.\nMenorrhagia causes women to have to change many sanitary napkins every hour, affecting daily activities and work.\nMenorrhagia can appear at different stages in a woman's life, and can appear in her teenage years when she begins to menstruate, or in her 40s and 50s when she women entering perimenopause.\nIn addition, menorrhagia also comes from many other causes such as:\nHormone imbalance in the body; Inflammation of the cervix or uterus; Fibroids.; Side effects of using intrauterine contraceptive devices; Hypothyroidism (due to underactive thyroid).; Changes in diet or exercise.\n\"Any situation of menorrhagia needs to be examined and examined to find the cause for timely intervention and treatment, avoiding unfortunate complications that may occur,\" Dr. Hoang Duy emphasized.\n2. Amenorrhea\nSome women may experience the opposite situation of menorrhagia, which is the complete absence of menstruation, called amenorrhea or amenorrhea.

Menstrual cramps\nMost women experience menstrual cramps before or during their period at some point in their lives. In some people, symptoms of menstrual cramps occur mildly every month. However, if the condition is painful and prolonged, called dysmenorrhea, women need to consult a doctor for proper health care.\nWomen may experience menstrual pain such as cramps due to uterine contractions under the activation of Prostaglandin - a hormone-like substance produced by uterine lining cells and circulating in the blood.
