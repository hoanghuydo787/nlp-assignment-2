    "content": "What is dyslipidemia? Causes, symptoms, prevention\n\nDyslipidemia is an abnormal amount of lipids in the blood, describing many common disorders such as high levels of LDL cholesterol, high triglycerides or low levels of HDL cholesterol.\n\nWhat do you need to know about lipids?\nLipids are waxy fats found in the blood, providing energy to cells and necessary for many body functions. Cholesterol and triglycerides (triglycerides) are the two most common types of lipids that cause disease conditions. Specifically: (1)\nLDL cholesterol: considered “bad cholesterol” because it contributes to the formation of plaque in blood vessels; HDL cholesterol: considered “good cholesterol” because it helps remove LDL from the blood.; Triglycerides: formed and developed when calories are not burned immediately, stored in fat cells.\nCholesterol is present in the body's cells. Triglycerides are also found in cells and in dietary fats (such as white fats in meat, oils, and dairy products). The liver also produces cholesterol and triglycerides.\n\nWhat is dyslipidemia?\nDyslipidemia is a definition that refers to higher or lower than normal levels of fats in the blood, such as: (2)\nLow-density lipoprotein (LDL) has high levels; High-density lipoprotein (HDL) has low levels; High levels of triglycerides; High LDL and triglyceride levels (High Cholesterol)\nPeople with high LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels or very low HDL levels have a higher risk of developing atherosclerosis. The accumulation of atherosclerotic plaque causes narrowing of the blood vessels, which over time progresses to severe narrowing, causing narrowing and occlusion of the blood vessels, leading to stroke and death.\n\nClassify\nLipid disorders are divided into two types: primary and secondary. If primary dyslipidemia is genetic, secondary dyslipidemia is an acquired condition (developing from other causes such as obesity, diabetes, etc.).\nThere are many types of primary lipid disorders, such as:\nHyperlipidemia or familial high cholesterol: This is the most common genetic cause of both high LDL cholesterol and high triglycerides. If hyperlipidemia is familial, the person may develop these problems in their teens or early 20s, often with a history of having a parent with high lipid disorders.; Familial hypercholesterolemia and polygenic hypercholesterolemia: Both are characterized by high total cholesterol.; Familial hyperapobetalipoproteinemia: This condition means high levels of apolipoprotein B (a protein and part of LDL cholesterol).\nSecondary causes:\nSedentary lifestyle, eating too many calories; Internal diseases: Diabetes, kidney failure, liver failure\nHyperlipidemia can have primary or secondary causes. If you have this condition, your body will have difficulty breaking down LDL cholesterol or triglycerides.\n\nSymptoms of lipid disorders\nMany people have lipid disorders but have no obvious symptoms and are often discovered during routine blood tests. Conversely, dyslipidemia can also cause some cardiovascular diseases and symptoms. (3)\nCommon signs to detect lipid disorders are usually when they affect organs in the body such as the brain, heart, and kidneys:\nChest tightness, pressure in the chest or chest pain;; Difficulty breathing;; Pain, tension and pressure in the neck, jaw, shoulders, back;; Heart beating fast;; Faint.\nLeg pain, especially when walking or standing, is a sign of lower limb vascular disease caused by lipid disorders.\nSome people with very high cholesterol and triglyceride levels may develop xanthomas (cholesterol deposits that appear around the eyes, ankles or elbows). This condition has not been reported in many cases and is common in familial hyperlipidemia.\n\nCauses of dyslipidemia\nObesity, unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle are the most common causes of dyslipidemia in adolescents and children. Genetics is also a notable cause. The most common form of inherited hypercholesterolemia is called heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Children should be tested for FH when a relative has high cholesterol or a heart attack before age 55 if male or age 65 if female.\nOther risk factors for dyslipidemia include: (4)\nHypertension; Smoke; Diabetes (type 1 and type 2); Kidney disease; Hypothyroidism; Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); Cushing's syndrome; Inflammatory bowel disease (IBS)\n\nDiagnostic method\nTo check for high, low, or healthy levels of LDL, HDL, and triglycerides, your doctor will perform a blood test. This level will change each year, so it is necessary to have a blood test every year. If you are taking medication for dyslipidemia, your doctor may order more frequent blood tests.\n\nIs dyslipidemia dangerous?\nDyslipidemia is a precursor to cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction, cerebral stroke, and kidney infarction. High levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides or low HDL levels put people at higher risk of having a heart attack.\n\nTreatments\nTreatment will vary depending on the cause of dyslipidemia and severity, such as whether the disease has complications or not? Treatment goals are often based on LDL targets, LDL targets will change depending on whether the patient is a high, medium or low risk group.\nHigh LDL cholesterol is often treated with statins, which interfere with cholesterol production in the liver. If statins do not improve triglyceride and LDL levels, your doctor may recommend additional medications such as: ezetimibe, niacin, fibrates, bile acid sequestrants, evolocumab and alirocumab, lomitapide and mipomersen.\n\nHow to prevent blood lipid disorders\nIf you are concerned about dyslipidemia, it is important to talk to your doctor about how to prevent it. In case of a family history of high cholesterol, future generations need to proactively choose a healthy life to avoid early complications.\nMaintain a reasonable weight, follow a scientific diet for the heart; At the same time, regular exercise and quitting smoking are also effective ways to prevent lipid disorders.\nReference: Bad habits for the heart\nRegular exercise helps prevent lipid disorders effectively.\n\nHow to care for people with lipid disorders\nAlthough dyslipidemia puts people at risk for heart attack and stroke, you can still protect yourself by living a healthier lifestyle and taking medication if needed. Be sure to follow your doctor's instructions for best results.\nQuit smoking; Get enough sleep; Reduce stress; Eat healthier foods; Limit alcohol intake; Maintain a healthy weight; Exercise regularly; Limit fat and animal viscera, increase eating green vegetables.\nSee more: What should you eat and avoid if you have dyslipidemia? 15 foods to keep in mind\nIn addition, patients need to comply with the time and dosage of medication as prescribed by the doctor, make sure to continue using the medication according to the instructions on the label, and have regular check-ups as scheduled.\n\nWhere to treat lipid disorders?\nDyslipidemia causes cardiovascular complications such as atherosclerosis, blood vessel blockage in the brain, heart or limbs. Each person will have different blood fat levels, so at the Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, doctors will choose individualized treatment methods, based on assessments of the risk of lipid disorders. blood to treat the patient at the right level, optimizing the final result.\nEvery day, patients need to move and exercise for 30 - 60 minutes, 5 - 7 days a week to prevent complications of lipid disorders. Each person has different activity intensity, so you should consult your doctor before exercising.\nCardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital is equipped with a modern bicycle dynamometer stress echocardiography system, with a load capacity of up to 140 kg, remote motor control, short survey time, and images. clear and precise. This test not only helps detect abnormalities in the heart early, but also determines the maximum level of exertion of the person performing it.\nTo schedule an examination, screening and treatment of blood lipid disorders at Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nTo prevent dyslipidemia, according to recommendations of the American Heart Association (AHA), each person should not tolerate more than 6% of daily calories from saturated fat; Also avoid trans fats. Instead, each person should prioritize cereals, fruits, vegetables..., proactively have health check-ups to screen for blood lipid disorders and receive timely treatment.",
