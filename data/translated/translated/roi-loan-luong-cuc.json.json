Symptoms of depressive episodes\nIn contrast to the manic phase, in the depressive phase, people with bipolar disorder will have negative thoughts and emotions.\nThe patient feels sad for no reason, nothing can make them feel better or happier.

However, the main symptoms of the disorder may differ between the sexes. Men may have many manic episodes while women may have many depressive episodes. Men with bipolar disorder during the manic phase may increase their abuse of stimulants such as alcohol, beer, cigarettes, drugs...\nMen with bipolar disorder are less likely than women to seek medical attention on their own.
