    "content": "Bradycardia: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment\n\nIf slow arrhythmia is not treated promptly and properly, it can lead to dizziness, lightheadedness, etc. In severe cases, it can lead to fainting due to lack of blood flow to the brain, even causing death. Learn about slow heart rhythm disorder in the article below. Heart rate is the number of heart contractions in 1 minute. This speed changes depending on the body's activities and emotional reactions. A healthy heart with a proper heart rate will help provide an adequate amount of blood to nourish the body's organs.\n\nWhat is bradyarrhythmia?\nBradycardia is a condition in which the heart rate is less than 60 beats/minute at rest. Meanwhile, a normal person's heart rate is a sinus rhythm, which is controlled by the sinus node, which is the main pacemaker of the heart. A normal person's heart rate ranges from 60 - 100 beats/minute at rest. (first)\nSee more: What is arrhythmia?\n\nCauses of slow heart rate\nDr. Pham Thanh Binh, Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, said that the heart will beat slower in the following cases: (2)\nImpaired pacemaker node function of the heart (sinus node insufficiency).; The conduction of rhythm in the heart is abnormal (conduction pathway blockage).\n“However, a slow heart rate is not always an abnormality. Some people have a slow heart rate but it is not a disease, such as athletes, or people's heart rate while sleeping,\" Dr. Binh added.\nSome drugs can cause slow heart rate, especially drugs used to treat other heart diseases such as drugs to treat high blood pressure, drugs to treat heart failure...\nIn some cases, bradycardia is also a pathology. This could be due to:\nCardiac pacemaker (sinus node) abnormality.; Aging of heart tissue.; Impairment or damage to the rhythm transmission system in the heart; Congenital heart disease.; Coronary heart disease.; After heart surgery.; Severe infection.; Sleep apnea.; Electrolyte disorders; Hypothyroidism.; Immune disease (systemic lupus erythematosus...).\n\nSymptoms of bradyarrhythmia\nNormally, some patients with bradyarrhythmia may have no symptoms, or mild, vague symptoms. However, in some other cases, patients may have symptoms such as:\nLightheadedness or dizziness;; Fainting or feeling like you're about to faint;; Feeling tired, weak, reduced ability to exercise;; Chest heaviness, chest tightness, chest discomfort;; Shortness of breath;; Memory decline;; Eating less than usual or appearing tired (especially in infants).\nLightheadedness and vertigo are one of the symptoms of bradyarrhythmia\nDr. Pham Thanh Binh recommends that when patients or their relatives have the above signs of bradyarrhythmia, they should immediately go to a medical facility to be examined and find the exact cause. This is extremely necessary work, contributing to finding safe, timely and effective treatment.\n\nDiagnosis of slow arrhythmia\nWhen the doctor suspects that the patient has signs of bradyarrhythmia, the doctor will ask for medical history, look for symptoms and conduct examination and examination. During the examination, the doctor will check the patient's pulse and listen to the patient's heartbeat. (3)\nTo know the basic electrical activity of the patient's heart, the doctor will order the patient to have an electrocardiogram (ECG). However, ECG measurement only records the heart's electrical activity for a short time. To monitor a patient's heart rate for a longer period of time, such as a day or multiple days, the doctor will prescribe a long-term continuous electrocardiogram (Holter ECG).\nWhen the patient wears Holter ECG, the patient can still live as usual. It is recommended that patients record symptoms that occur during the Holter ECG procedure, based on which the doctor will have a basis to help accurately diagnose the disease and provide appropriate and effective treatment.\nWhen wearing Holter ECG, patients can still function normally\nAfter the doctor knows for sure that the patient has a slow arrhythmia, the doctor may ask the patient to do additional clinical tests to find the cause, including:\nBlood tests;; Echocardiography;; Measure drug concentrations that affect heart rate (if any).; Electrophysiological survey to evaluate the functioning of the sinus node, conduction pathways...\n\nMethods of treating heart arrhythmias\nDr. CKI Pham Thanh Binh said that the treatment of bradyarrhythmia will depend on the symptoms and cause of the disease. If the disease has a bradycardia but originates from abnormal physiological changes (such as athletes, bradycardia during sleep...), treatment and intervention are often not necessary. (4)\nIf the bradycardia is caused by the use of medication to treat another disease, the doctor may change, adjust the dosage or direct the patient to stop using certain medications that cause the bradycardia.\nSome patients with symptomatic bradyarrhythmias, or bradycardia due to severe, irreversible disease, will need to be treated with the implantation of a device called a “pacemaker”. The pacemaker is implanted under the skin near the patient's heart. The pacemaker will send impulses, helping the heart rhythm return to normal.\nThe pacemaker is permanently implanted into the wall of the heart to send impulses for the heart to function normally\n\nCaring for patients with slow arrhythmias\nIn order to restore the heart rate to normal levels, in addition to regular examinations and compliance with the cardiologist's treatment regimen, patients with bradyarrhythmias need to pay attention to combining recommended measures. following statement:\nGive up bad habits that are harmful to heart health such as alcohol habits, regular smoking...; Have a scientific diet, supplement foods that are good for the heart such as green vegetables, salmon, limit animal fats and sources of cholesterol such as eggs, fatty milk,...; Increase physical activities, exercise, and play appropriate sports; Pay attention to work balance, as well as life balance, avoid pressure and stress.\nIn addition, early screening for cardiovascular diseases plays a very important role, helping patients detect disease risk factors early and take measures to protect the body from serious complications. for health.\nSlow arrhythmia can lead to many dangerous complications for patients, so Dr. Pham Thanh Binh recommends that patients immediately go to a medical facility when there are unusual signs for accurate diagnosis and treatment. timely intervention.",
