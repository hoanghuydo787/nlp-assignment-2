    "content": "Endocrine disorders: Causes, symptoms and diagnosis\n\nThere are many endocrine disorders, most of which are caused by disorders in the body's hormone production process. Endocrine disorders occur when the function of the endocrine system is not maintained. The cause may come from the endocrine glands that produce hormones, the receptors that respond to hormones, or the target organs affected by hormones. Regardless of the cause, endocrine disorders can affect the functions of the entire body.\n\nWhat is the endocrine system?\nThe endocrine system consists of a series of interconnected organs and glands, responsible for producing and secreting endocrine hormones, playing an important role in controlling and regulating metabolism and metabolism. energy metabolism, reproduction, development as well as the body's response to stress, injury, and mood. (first)\nThe endocrine system includes:\nHypothalamus: located at the base of the brain near the optic chiasm, has the function of secreting hormones that stimulate or inhibit hormone secretion of the pituitary gland, controlling water balance in the body, temperature, appetite, sleep and blood pressure.; Pituitary gland: is a small endocrine gland the size of a pea located in the lower part of the brain. It is a central endocrine gland that commands and controls the functions of other endocrine glands in the periphery.; Pineal gland: located below the corpus callosum, in the middle of the brain, secretes the hormone melatonin to help control sleep; Thyroid and parathyroid glands: located in front and below the neck, below the larynx. The thyroid gland plays an important role in the body's metabolism. The parathyroid gland plays an important role in regulating the body's calcium balance.; Thymus: located in the upper part of the chest, in the chest behind the sternum, has the function of creating immune cells that help the body fight infections and destroy abnormal cells.; Adrenal glands: there are 2 adrenal glands located above each kidney. Like many other endocrine glands, the adrenal glands function in close association with the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. The adrenal glands create and release corticosteroid hormones and catecholamines to help maintain blood pressure and regulate metabolism.; Pancreas: located behind the stomach. The pancreas plays an important role in the digestive process, as well as the production of endocrine hormones. Hormones produced by the pancreas include insulin and glucagon, which help regulate blood sugar levels.; Ovaries: located deep in the female pelvis, on both sides of the uterus, connected to the uterus through the fallopian tubes. In addition to containing egg cells necessary for reproduction, the ovaries also produce estrogen and progesterone, which play an important role in maintaining female characteristics and metabolism in the female body.; Testicles: located in the male scrotum, play a role in producing sperm for reproduction and testosterone to help maintain male characteristics.\n\nEndocrine disorders can be caused by a variety of reasons\nDysfunction originates from the peripheral endocrine glands such as the thyroid gland, adrenal glands, ovaries, testicles... (also called primary disorders).\nSecondary disorders originate from the pituitary gland and hypothalamus, causing inhibition or excessive stimulation of peripheral endocrine glands.\nA more rare cause is due to abnormal response of target organs to endocrine hormones (often causing functional impairment).\nDisorders can lead to increased hormone production causing hyperfunction or decreased hormone production causing dysfunction.\nThere are different types of endocrine disorders depending on the endocrine glands and the related hormones of each gland.\n\nSymptoms of endocrine disorders\nEach different endocrine disorder will have specific symptoms depending on the disease. Common endocrine disorders:\nDiabetes: occurs when the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin or has insulin resistance, leading to increased blood sugar levels. If blood sugar levels increase, it will lead to symptoms such as: weight loss, increased thirst, increased drinking, frequent urination, slow healing of ulcers, increased risk of infections, especially tuberculosis, blurred vision, and other diseases. neurological complications such as numbness in the feet, loss of sensation, bloating, indigestion, urination disorders...; Hyperthyroidism: occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone and releases it into the blood, causing symptoms and signs such as weight loss, fast heartbeat, irregular heartbeat, palpitations, tremors, increased sweating, sensitivity to hot temperatures, muscle weakness causing difficulty climbing stairs, rapid fatigue, loose stools, irritability...; Hypothyroidism: occurs when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone, causing symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, sluggishness, depression, swelling of the face and eyelids, sensitivity to cold temperatures, constipation, skin dryness, slow heart rate, cramps, menstrual disorders...; Cushing's syndrome: occurs when there is an excess of the hormone cortisol in the body. Cortisol plays a role in helping the body respond to physical or mental stress, regulating metabolism, and maintaining blood pressure. Excess cortisol can be due to endogenous causes, such as in the case of an adrenal adenoma that increases cortisol secretion, or due to exogenous causes, such as overuse of drugs containing corticosteroids. Symptoms of excess cortisol include weight gain, round face like the moon, fatty lumps on the back of the neck, shrunken limbs, muscle weakness, thin skin, easy bruising, slow wound healing, hair loss, and stretch marks. purplish redness in the abdomen and thighs, decreased sexual function...; Primary hyperaldosteronism: usually due to adrenal tumors or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, which increases aldosterone hormone secretion, causing hypertension and hypokalemia. Hypokalemia will cause symptoms such as muscle weakness, cramps, headaches, palpitations, increased drinking, frequent urination, and nocturia. Moderate-severe hypertension can be resistant to conventional treatment. Hyperaldosteronism is one of the causes of high blood pressure in young people that needs to be screened.; Pheochromocytomas: due to tumors originating from the adrenal medulla, increased secretion of catecholamines in the blood. Symptoms include high blood pressure, pale skin, sweating, palpitations, and headaches. There are also symptoms such as goosebumps, nausea, vomiting, hand tremors, fatigue, difficulty breathing, chest pain, and epigastric pain. This is also one of the causes of high blood pressure in young people.; Adrenal insufficiency: chronic adrenal insufficiency will have symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, dizziness due to postural hypotension, anxiety, abdominal pain, and slow physical development in children. In addition, primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) also has symptoms of increased skin pigmentation, especially on sun-exposed areas, skin folds, mucous membranes, scars, and areolas. A dangerous complication of adrenal insufficiency is acute adrenal insufficiency with symptoms such as severe muscle weakness, fainting, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, back pain, confusion, delirium, hypotension and possibly Can be fatal if not treated promptly.; Acromegaly: usually due to pituitary adenoma increasing growth hormone secretion, leading to abnormal development of bones, organs, and other tissues in the body. Common symptoms of acromegaly include large, coarse hands and feet, increasing in size compared to before, manifested through increased shoe, glove, and ring size. Facial features change, coarse face, longer vertical diameter, large nose, enlarged frontal bone, protruding lower jaw, raised eyebrows, sparse teeth, enlarged tongue, deep voice. Increased sweating, causing strong odor, increased sebum secretion. Acne, excess hair. Carpal tunnel syndrome, hand numbness, extremity paresthesia. Hypertrophy of cartilage and synovial tissue leads to hypertrophic arthritis leading to joint pain, back pain, and hunchback.; Prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma: hyperprolactinemia causes typical symptoms in premenopausal men and women, but not typical in postmenopausal women. Pre-menopausal women have symptoms such as infertility, oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, and galactorrhea (less common than the remaining symptoms). Men will have symptoms such as decreased sexual desire, infertility, impotence, gynecomastia, or galactorrhea (very rare), osteoporosis (if hypogonadism persists). For postmenopausal women, hyperprolactinemia is only recognized when the pituitary adenoma is large enough to cause headaches or vision loss, or the pituitary tumor is discovered incidentally on MRI. Symptoms of galactorrhea are rare in women. postmenopausal women. Children will have symptoms such as primary amenorrhea and delayed puberty.; Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): is a condition in which the ovaries produce abnormal amounts of androgens. Androgen is a male sex hormone, normally only present in very small amounts in women. Symptoms of PCOS include being overweight, obese, amenorrhea, irregular or sparse menstruation, infertility, hirsutism, sebaceous skin with acne, vaginal dryness, large or multiple ovaries. cysts, black thorn marks on the back of the neck, under the armpits, under the breasts...\n\nDiagnosis of endocrine disorders\nSymptoms of endocrine disorders can be discreet, difficult to recognize, progress silently over time and are non-specific, so clinical detection is often delayed after many months or even years. For this reason, performing blood tests to measure hormone levels of the peripheral endocrine glands and pituitary gland is necessary in detecting and diagnosing the disease.\nDiagnosis of endocrine disorders is a complex process that requires coordination of blood and urine tests, endocrine dynamic tests as well as imaging and genetic tests, because the endocrine system is the structure of the endocrine system. Structure has connectivity - regulating many different functions of the body such as growth, metabolism and reproduction.\nIf you have any symptoms of suspected endocrine disorders, you should see an endocrinologist to have tests performed based on symptoms and suspected endocrine diseases such as:\nUrine test.; Blood test quantifies hormone levels.; Fine needle aspiration biopsy; Imaging tests: ultrasound, computed tomography (CT scan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).; Genetic testing - genetics.\nIf the body has unusual symptoms, the patient should see an endocrinologist to find out the cause of endocrine disorders affecting health.\n\nTreatment of endocrine disorders\nTreatment principles are based on the pathogenesis of endocrine disorders and depend on the disease condition.\nIn case of impaired endocrine function, it will usually be treated by supplementing peripheral hormones regardless of whether the cause of impaired function originates from the peripheral endocrine gland or from the pituitary-hypothalamic gland. Except for some cases such as growth retardation due to lack of GH hormone, a hormone secreted by the pituitary gland, which will be treated with synthetic GH hormone injections... In most cases, it will be treated with oral peripheral hormones. as in hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency...\nFor cases of endocrine hyperfunction due to increased hormones in the blood, treatment methods include using drugs that inhibit hormone synthesis, surgery or radiotherapy depending on the specific cause of the disease. For example, when a patient has a prolactin-secreting pituitary tumor that increases blood prolactin, depending on the tumor size and clinical symptoms, the patient is prescribed oral medication to reduce blood prolactin levels and reduce tumor size. or prescribe surgery when necessary.\nEat a variety of protein-rich foods such as avocados, almonds, peanuts, macadamia nuts, salmon... to supplement the body with essential nutrients and prevent endocrine disorders.\n\nMethods to prevent endocrine disorders\nMany endocrine disorders due to certain causes do not have specific prevention measures, however some endocrine disorders can be prevented through changing eating habits and a healthy lifestyle. can help improve health and keep hormones in balance in the body, including:\nMaintain a reasonable weight.; Have a scientific, balanced diet; Exercise regularly.; Reduce stress; Get enough sleep, on time, avoid staying up late.; No smoking.; Control chronic diseases if any.\nDepartment of Endocrinology - Diabetes, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City with good doctors, many years of experience, always dedicated to visiting, examining, and having effective treatment regimens for endocrine disorders and diseases. thyroid, diabetes... helps patients feel secure in protecting their health.\nEndocrine disorders greatly affect health and quality of life. Therefore, when the body shows signs of abnormalities, patients need to go to an Endocrinology - Diabetes specialist to be examined, find the cause, and have early treatment methods to better protect their health.",
