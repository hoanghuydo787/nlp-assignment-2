    "content": "Dissociative disorders: Causes, signs, treatments\n\nDissociative disorders are a group of common mental illnesses, accounting for about 11 - 300/100,000 population. The disease starts from a stressful event, often occurs in young people, and is more common in women than in men.\n\nWhat is dissociative disorder?\nDissociative disorders are mental disorders that involve a disconnection from a patient's thoughts, feelings, memories, or sense of identity. Patients escape this condition by being incontinent, which is harmful to their health and affects daily life functions.\nPeople who experience a traumatic event will often have some degree of dissociation during the event itself or in the following hours, days, or weeks. For example, an event seems 'unreal' or the person feels detached from what is going on around them as if watching events on television. (first)\n\nSigns of dissociative disorder\nSymptoms and signs of dissociative disorder depend on the type and severity, but may include:\nFeeling unable to control your emotions; Problems facing strong emotions; Sudden and unexpected mood changes (for example, feeling very sad for no reason); Problems with depression or anxiety, or both; Feeling as if the world is distorted or unreal; Patients with memory problems unrelated to physical trauma or medical conditions; Other cognitive (thinking related) problems such as loss of concentration; Loss of memory for a certain period of time, related to events, people, personal information.; Feeling the need to behave in a certain way; Identity confusion (for example, behaving in a way that the person would normally object to or would never do)\nThe dissociative disorders listed in the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5 are as follows:\nDissociative identity disorder: Alternation of two or more distinct personality states with impaired recall between personality states. In some extreme cases, the master personality does not recognize other, alternating personalities; but, alternate personalities can perceive most existing personalities.; Dissociative amnesia: temporary memory loss, specifically episodic memory, due to a traumatic or stressful event. This is considered the most common manifestation of the recorded diseases. This disorder can occur suddenly or gradually and can last from minutes to years depending on the severity of the injury.; Depersonalization-derealization disorder: episodes of detachment from self or surroundings that may be experienced as “unreal” (lacking control or being “outside” the self) while still aware that this is just a feeling and not a reality.; The old category of unspecified dissociative disorder is now divided into two categories: other specified dissociative disorder and unspecified dissociative disorder. This classification is often applied to forms of pathological dissociation that do not meet the criteria for other specified dissociative disorders.\n\nCauses of dissociative disorders\nDissociative disorders are believed by many experts to have their roots in adverse childhood experiences including abuse and loss, but the symptoms are often difficult to recognize or misdiagnosed in children and adolescents. . The reasons for these limitations are: (2)\nChildren have difficulty expressing their inner experiences; Parents may miss signals or try to hide abusive or neglectful behaviors; Signs may be subtle or transient; Children fall into a state of emotional disorders, memory and concentration related to dissociation that can be confused with other disorders.\nSigns of hidden stool disorders are difficult to detect, so they are easily overlooked\nTherefore, recognizing dissociative symptoms in children is considered a challenge.\nDissociative disorders often develop as a way of coping with trauma. Unpredictable or scary family environments can also cause a child to 'detach' from reality during times of stress. The severity of the disease in adulthood may be directly related to the severity of the childhood trauma.\nIn addition to developing diagnostic tests for children and adolescents, a number of approaches have been developed to improve the recognition and understanding of dissociation in children. Recent studies have focused on neurochemical, functional, and structural abnormalities of the brain (possibly resulting from childhood trauma) to clarify the neural basis of dissociation-related symptoms. .\nTraumatic events that occur during adulthood such as war, torture, or experiencing a natural disaster can also cause the disorder. (3)\n\nEffects of dissociative disorders on life and health\nIf left untreated, possible effects on a person with dissociative disorder may include:\nDifficulties in life such as relationships, jobs...; Having sleep problems such as insomnia; Sexual problems; Depression; Anxiety disorders; Eating disorder; Self-harm, even suicide\n\nDiagnosis of dissociative disorders\nDiagnosis can be difficult because the disease is complex and its symptoms are common to a number of other conditions. For example:\nPhysical causes can cause forgetfulness and other cognitive problems.; Mental illnesses such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder can cause symptoms similar to dissociative disorders.; The effects of some substances, including some recreational drugs and prescription drugs, can mimic the symptoms.; Diagnosis can be further hindered when the disorder coexists with another mental health problem such as depression.\n\nTreatment of dissociative disorders\nThe effectiveness of treatments for dissociative disorders has not been studied. Treatment options are based on case studies. Options may include:\nA safe environment; Psychiatric medications, such as sedatives; Psychotherapy (also called ‘talk therapy’ or counselling) is often needed over the long term; Stress management; Treatment of other accompanying disorders\n\nWhere to find help?\nPsychological doctor; Psychologist\nTam Anh General Hospital Psychology Clinic in Ho Chi Minh City is an integrated clinic model within a general hospital, providing comprehensive medical examination and treatment consulting services. The clinic applies testing, consultation or selection of appropriate treatment methods for each child. Art, music, game or conversation therapies are appropriate for each age group.
