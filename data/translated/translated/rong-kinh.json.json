    "content": "Menorrhagia: Causes, signs, treatment and prevention\n\nMenorrhagia is not a rare condition, but many women still neglect examination and treatment, which over time affects their health and fertility. All information about this condition will be answered in detail in the article below with the professional advice of Dr. Nguyen Quang Nhat, Doctor of Obstetrics and Gynecology Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City. .\n\nWhat is menorrhagia?\nMenorrhagia (English name Menorrhagia) is a phenomenon in which menstrual blood flows too much or lasts longer than a normal cycle. Normally, a normal menstrual cycle lasts 28-32 days, the menstrual period is 3-5 days. The amount of menstrual blood about 50-80ml is the uterine lining shedding. Next, a new uterine lining is formed for the next cycle. (first)\nThe phenomenon of a menstrual cycle lasting more than 7 days or menstrual blood volume of more than 80ml is considered menorrhagia. To evaluate whether the amount of menstrual blood per cycle is more or less, women can rely on the quantity and number of sanitary napkin changes. If you have to change sanitary napkins continuously every hour or use more than two sanitary napkins at the same time, it proves that the amount of menstrual blood is abnormally heavy.\nIf you have to change sanitary napkins continuously every hour, that is a sign of menorrhagia\nBesides, heavy menstrual bleeding at night or blood clotting into large clots are also signs of this phenomenon. Prolonged menorrhagia can make women anemic, tired and pale. More dangerously, this disease also creates conditions for harmful bacteria to multiply and develop, causing infections of the genital organs, easily causing gynecological diseases and causing infertility in women.\nDr. Nguyen Quang Nhat, Doctor of Obstetrics and Gynecology Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, recommends that if you encounter this condition, you should immediately go to the hospital for early examination and find out the cause. Exactly. From the diagnosis results and the physical condition, the doctor will advise and guide appropriate treatment.\n\nWhat are the signs of menorrhagia?\nDoctor Nguyen Quang Nhat shares common signs of menorrhagia to help women easily recognize them. These signs include: (2)\nDysmenorrhea;; The amount of menstrual blood is heavy during menstruation, lasting continuously for more than 7 days, even up to 10 days;; Menstrual blood volume is more than 80ml instead of 50-80ml in a normal cycle;; Have to change sanitary napkins every few hours;; Must use two or more sanitary napkins at the same time;; Appearance of large blood clots;; Symptoms of anemia appear such as feeling tired, short of breath, and exhausted. When you have anemia, you may experience symptoms of a condition called PICA, including hair loss, pale skin, and wanting to eat non-food items such as hair, paper, dirt, etc.\nWhen having these symptoms, women should go to the hospital immediately for examination and appropriate treatment.\nWhen there are symptoms such as prolonged menstrual cramps, heavy menstrual bleeding, etc., women need to go to the hospital immediately to be examined.\n\nCauses of menorrhagia\nMenorrhagia can be due to many reasons, from hormone-related problems, other medical conditions or sometimes stress. Below are the most common causes: (3)\n1. Hormone imbalance\nThe balance between the hormones Estrogen and Progesterone in women will help regulate the accumulation of uterine lining that sheds during the menstrual cycle. If there is a hormone deficiency that causes an imbalance, the uterine lining will overgrow, leading to heavy menstrual bleeding.\nCauses that can disrupt hormone balance in women include polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid disease, obesity, insulin resistance...\n2. Ovarian dysfunction\nIf eggs are not released during the menstrual cycle, the female body cannot produce the hormone Progesterone as in a normal menstrual cycle, causing hormone imbalance, resulting in menorrhagia.\n3. Uterine fibroids\nBenign uterine fibroids are also one of the reasons why menstrual cycles last longer than normal.\n4. Endometriosis\nEndometriosis in the uterine muscle can cause pain and bleeding, causing the patient to see more blood flow in and out of the cycle.\n5. Uterine polyps\nBenign, small polyps located on the uterine lining can cause prolonged bleeding.\n6. Insert an IUD\nMenorrhagia is also one of the common side effects of IUD insertion to prevent pregnancy.\n7. Related to pregnancy\nMiscarriage (death of the fetus in the uterus) or ectopic pregnancy can cause abnormal bleeding.\nEctopic pregnancy is one of the causes of prolonged menstrual bleeding\n8. Using medicine\nSome medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs, anticoagulants, hormonal drugs... can cause prolonged menstrual bleeding.\n9. Other diseases\nInherited blood clotting disorders such as Von Willebrand disease can cause abnormal menstrual bleeding. In addition, cervical cancer, uterine cancer or ovarian cancer can also lead to menorrhagia.\n10. Other risk factors\nDuring a normal menstrual cycle, the ovaries release eggs (ovulation) to produce the hormone Progesterone for the body, keeping the menstrual cycle regular. If the egg is not released, the amount of Progesterone hormone can cause heavy bleeding.\nMenorrhagia in adolescents is due to disorders of the ovulation process. For teenage girls, usually the first year eggs cannot be released from the ovaries.\nFor women of reproductive age, this phenomenon is related to diseases such as uterine fibroids, uterine polyps or endometriosis. In addition, other diseases such as uterine cancer, hereditary blood clotting disorders, liver and kidney diseases or side effects of medications can also cause this condition.\nIn addition, premenopausal menorrhagia is also one of the common conditions in middle-aged women.\n\nHow long does menorrhagia last?\nNormally, menstruation lasts 3-5 days. If menstruation lasts more than 7 days, it is called menorrhagia. However, the length of time for each person will be different, depending on the cause of the disease\n\nIs menorrhagia dangerous? Any impact?\nWhat dangers will people with menorrhagia face? This is a common question that women have when they fall into this condition. Doctor Nguyen Quang Nhat said that when menstrual bleeding is too much or lasts too long without effective treatment, it can lead to other diseases. Specifically: (4)\n1. Anemia\nThe disease can cause anemia due to excessive blood loss during each menstrual cycle. When suffering from anemia, women will experience difficulty breathing, body fatigue, pale skin, lack of vitality...\nIf menorrhagia is not treated effectively for a long time, it can cause serious anemia, fatigue, paleness, lack of vitality...\n2. Severe abdominal pain\nBesides heavy menstrual bleeding, women may feel severe abdominal pain (symptoms similar to menstrual cramps). In some cases, cramps are related to menorrhagia.\n3. Risk of infertility - infertility\nWhen you have menorrhagia, the blood will be black due to being stagnant for a long time in the uterus, which creates favorable conditions for harmful bacteria to penetrate and cause disease. Bacteria can travel from the vagina to the fallopian tubes, uterine cavity, etc., affecting women's fertility.\nIn addition, heavy bleeding is also a symptom of many other gynecological diseases such as endometritis, uterine polyps, uterine fibroids, polycystic ovaries... If neglected, not examined and treated. Early on, the disease can cause infertility, robbing women of their \"natural role\" as mothers.\n\nWhat to do if you have menorrhagia?\nSuddenly one fine day, noticing that the menstrual cycle is different and has typical signs of the disease, surely all women are worried and wonder what to do if they have menorrhagia? Doctor Nguyen Quang Nhat advises that in this case, women need to:\n1. Adjust your scientific lifestyle\nLifestyle is one of the effective ways to improve menorrhagia. You need:\nRest properly, avoid strenuous activities and movements;; Keep a happy spirit, avoid tension and stress;; Sleep on time and get enough sleep;; Clean the private area thoroughly and replace it with a new one regularly.\n2. Follow a reasonable diet\nA reasonable diet will help improve fatigue, supplement the body with nutrients to avoid anemia, as well as provide more energy to help the body become healthier. Women should note:\nAdd more green fruits and vegetables to your daily menu to stabilize blood sugar, balance hormones, and limit infections;; Eat more sea fish or fatty fish to help reduce pain and inflammation;; Increase foods rich in iron and vitamin B6 to improve anemia;; You should eat more cereals because they contain less glycemic and will help balance hormones;; Do not use stimulants such as alcohol, beer, coffee;; Do not eat hot, spicy dishes such as lots of chili and pepper.\nWomen should increase green vegetables into their daily diet to balance hormones and limit infections\n3. Visit a gynecologist\nGoing for a gynecological examination is the most necessary and important thing to do when discovering menorrhagia. Through examination and finding the exact cause of the disease, the doctor will advise and guide you on the most effective treatment, thoroughly resolving this condition, avoiding dangerous complications that affect your health and well-being. fertility.\n\nDiagnostic method\nDoctor Nguyen Quang Nhat said that to accurately diagnose the condition and cause, it is necessary to exploit medical history information (self and family), physical examination and blood tests in case of suspected anemia. .\nThrough the initial examination, the doctor will prescribe necessary additional tests to prescribe appropriate and effective treatment.\nNext, women may be prescribed some other tests to increase the accuracy of the diagnosis results. Those tests are:\nUltrasound: Uses sound waves to observe images in the uterus, ovaries and pelvis;; PAP test: Takes a small sample of cells from the surface of the cervix to check for infection, cancer cells or cancer seeds;; Endometrial biopsy: Takes tissue samples from the endometrium to check for the presence of cancer.; Laparoscopy: Make a small incision to observe the abdomen.; Hysteroscopy: Use a hysteroscope with a video camera attached to observe the uterus.; Hysterosalpingography: Inserting contrast material into the uterus and fallopian tubes to observe the uterus on X-ray.\n\nHow to treat menorrhagia\nTreatment will depend on two main factors: the cause and the woman's desire to have children.\nUsually, doctors will prescribe medication for women to improve menorrhagia. It could be birth control pills, pain relievers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), Progesterone hormone supplements or iron supplements to avoid anemia. If medical treatment is not effective, the doctor will prescribe surgery.\nTreatment procedures can be uterine dilation and curettage, endometrial ablation or hysterectomy (including uterus and cervix)... However, the limitation of these procedures is that they can cause complications. infertility, so it is only applicable to cases where women are older or no longer need to have children.\nEach person's condition is different, and the causes of the disease are also different. Therefore, when suspected of being sick, women should immediately go to a medical facility with a reputable Obstetrics and Gynecology unit to be examined, determine the exact cause of the disease, and then have a suitable treatment regimen. effective.\n\nPrevention of menorrhagia\nThe cause of the disease cannot be prevented. However, women can consult a doctor and follow a gynecological examination schedule every 6 months or according to specific instructions to control the condition well, without affecting health and fertility. , live happily, healthily and happily.\nObstetrics and Gynecology Center, Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of skilled and experienced Obstetrics and Gynecology experts; owns a modern machinery system that supports accurate diagnosis of the condition, thereby providing effective treatment for each patient.\nTo get advice and schedule an examination with good Obstetrics and Gynecology experts at Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nHopefully through this article, women will understand more about menorrhagia, as well as know what to do when they get sick.
