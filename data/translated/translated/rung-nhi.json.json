    "content": "Atrial fibrillation: Causes, signs and diagnosis you need to know\n\nAtrial fibrillation is one of the most common arrhythmias. If not detected early and treated promptly, patients are at risk of heart failure, stroke, and even death. This article is expertly advised by Doctor Vu Tran Dinh Huy, Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City. Statistics show that atrial fibrillation is the cause of about 5% of stroke cases each year. Patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation have an increased risk of death by up to 34%. In particular, the incidence of the disease will gradually increase with age, specifically the average incidence is only about 0.1% in people under 40 years old but will increase to 1.5 - 2% in people over 80 years old. (first)\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation?\nAtrial fibrillation or atrial fibrillation is one of the common heart rhythm disorders, especially in elderly patients (usually over 60 years old). In atrial fibrillation, the patient's heart beat is irregular and chaotic even when resting - said Dr. Vu Tran Dinh Huy, Heart Center of Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City.\nDiseases can be divided into 4 types, including: (2)\nParoxysmal atrial fibrillation: This is a type of atrial fibrillation that begins and ends suddenly. Atrial fibrillation can last as short as a few minutes, or it can last for hours or days. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation can end on its own without medical intervention. During atrial fibrillation, patients often have symptoms of palpitations, fatigue, and shortness of breath. The longer atrial fibrillation lasts, the higher the risk of stroke complications; Persistent atrial fibrillation: A type of atrial fibrillation that lasts more than a week. In order for the heart to return to normal rhythm, the patient needs to use special medications or special intervention methods such as \"electric shock cardioversion\".; Persistent atrial fibrillation: Atrial fibrillation that lasts more than 12 months; Permanent atrial fibrillation: A condition in which the heart cannot return to a normal rhythm. Attempts to return the patient to a normal heart rate are largely ineffective and the patient will depend entirely on medication to partially control the symptoms of the disease.\nIn some patients, this condition may appear and then stop on its own, so it is called paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. However, the disease can progress, persist and continuously become persistent atrial fibrillation.\n\nSymptoms of atrial fibrillation\nAccording to Dr. Huy, many patients have no symptoms or very vague symptoms. Atrial fibrillation is only discovered by chance through a routine medical examination. (3)\nSome other patients may have symptoms of atrial fibrillation, such as:\nNervousness, palpitations in the chest.; Shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat or rhythm; Difficulty breathing, especially when moving or exercising; Lightheadedness, dizziness or even the feeling of fainting.; Reduced ability to exercise, weakness, easy fatigue; Chest heaviness, chest tightness, chest pain.\nIn addition, atrial fibrillation is also one of the causes of stroke. Many patients only learn they have atrial fibrillation after being hospitalized for a stroke.\n\nCauses of atrial fibrillation\nDr. Huy said that usually atrial fibrillation occurs due to many factors or a combination of causes, rarely the disease occurs due to just one single cause.\nCauses that can lead to atrial fibrillation include:\nAfter heart surgery; Congenital heart disease; Cardiomyopathy; Heart valve disease; Coronary heart disease; Hypertension; Patients with heart failure; Chronic lung disease; Hyperthyroidism; Viral infection; Sleep apnea; Pericarditis\nPeople with cardiovascular disease need regular check-ups to detect atrial fibrillation early.\nFactors that increase the risk that patients need to pay attention to include:\nAge: The older you are, the higher your risk of getting the disease; Drinking alcohol: High levels will increase the risk of atrial fibrillation.; Obesity: Higher risk of disease; Family history: This also increases the risk of atrial fibrillation occurring.\n“However, in at least about 10% of patients with atrial fibrillation, no clear underlying cause can be found. Atrial fibrillation can be related to stress, excessive use of alcohol or stimulants such as caffeine, smoking, electrolyte disorders, severe infections, etc. In some cases, the disease can be related to related to genetics, or more simply idiopathic in the elderly,\" said Dr. Huy.\n\nMethod of diagnosing atrial fibrillation\nTo diagnose and detect atrial fibrillation, the doctor will examine the patient's medical history, symptoms of suspected atrial fibrillation, and medical history of the patient and family. Next, the patient will have a cardiovascular examination to support the diagnosis. Doctors may also order patients to undergo a number of additional tests, including: (4)\nRoutine electrocardiogram (ECG): This is the most basic diagnostic used to diagnose atrial fibrillation. ECG is a machine that records heart rhythm through electrodes glued/attached to the patient's body. However, ECG only records heart rate for a short period of time, so it can miss the disease if the patient is \"out of an attack\" of atrial fibrillation.; Holter ECG: Is an electrocardiogram recording device that is more compact and can be worn conveniently. In cases where the patient has symptoms suspected of atrial fibrillation, but the attacks are short, infrequent and difficult to detect when measuring ECG, the doctor may prescribe Holter ECG measurement to continuously record heart rhythm within a period of time. 24 hours or multiple days. Monitoring and recording heart rate for one/many days will help increase the ability to \"catch\" atrial fibrillation, contributing to the accurate diagnosis of the medical condition.; Heart rate event recorder: A portable heart rate recording device with the ability to monitor heart rate from weeks to months. However, the machine does not automatically record ECG continuously like Holter ECG. When the patient feels symptoms of arrhythmia such as nervousness, shortness of breath, fast heartbeat, palpitations, weakness, etc., the patient will press a button on the machine. The device will save your heart rate before and after you press the button for a few minutes. Your doctor will review your heart rhythm while you have symptoms to determine what rhythm it is, helping to detect atrial fibrillation if present.\n\nIs atrial fibrillation dangerous?\nIn patients with atrial fibrillation, the two top chambers of the heart (called the atria) contract very quickly and chaotically and irregularly. This leads to blood stagnation in the atria, creating conditions for blood clots to form in the heart. These blood clots can then be pumped out by the heart, traveling through blood vessels to the brain or other organs, causing a stroke or acute blood vessel blockage in other parts of the body. Patients with atrial fibrillation have a 5-7 times higher risk of stroke than other patients.\nIn atrial fibrillation, the heart beats irregularly, often beating rapidly continuously, causing the heart to contract poorly, weaken and reduce the effectiveness of pumping blood to the body. On the other hand, if this condition persists over time, it will increase the risk of heart failure, while also aggravating other cardiovascular diseases, and most dangerously, it can cause death.\n\nTreatment methods for atrial fibrillation\nDr. Huy emphasized that, whether the atrial fibrillation is short-term or continuous, patients need to be examined and treated by an arrhythmia specialist. Treatment can vary widely depending on when the patient was diagnosed, the patient's symptoms, underlying medical conditions, and the patient's current cardiovascular status.\nIn general, the goals of atrial fibrillation treatment are:\nControl of maintaining a normal heart rate (sinus rhythm) or controlling the heart rate in atrial fibrillation (keeping the rate not too fast or not too slow).; Prevents clot formation in the heart and reduces the risk of stroke.\n“Treatment of atrial fibrillation requires a combination of methods, including lifestyle changes, medications and specialized procedures to eliminate atrial fibrillation. The choice of treatment methods will vary depending on each individual patient, so patients need to listen to advice and follow the doctor's instructions to get the best treatment results,\" said Dr. Huy. know.\nDrugs used in treatment\nAntiarrhythmic drugs help to convert atrial fibrillation and maintain sinus rhythm.; Medicines to help control heart rate (not too fast) during atrial fibrillation; Anticoagulants to keep blood clots in the heart from forming.\nSurgical and procedural interventions\nElectrical shock: The doctor will use an electric shock machine to convert atrial fibrillation back to a normal heart rhythm, sinus rhythm.; Atrial fibrillation ablation: The doctor will use small wires with electrodes attached (catheters) to be inserted into the heart chambers through blood vessels, then use a machine system to probe the heart's electrical activity to ablate/condense the heart. establish arrhythmia zones causing atrial fibrillation using high-frequency radio waves; Pacemaker implantation: In some patients with complications of sinus node failure due to atrial fibrillation, permanent pacemaker implantation may be considered to prevent possible cardiac arrest, thereby protecting life. patient.\nPatients may be referred for procedural or surgical intervention.\nLifestyle changes in the treatment of atrial fibrillation\nBesides treating atrial fibrillation with medication or surgical intervention or a combination of both, patients can also adjust a number of factors to help the treatment process be more effective and improve their health status. more like:\nLimit alcohol; Limit the use of stimulants such as caffeine and energy drinks; Stop smoking; Exercise regularly; Reduce stress and pressure; Control your body weight well, avoid overweight and obesity\nIn addition, patients need to pay attention to good control of underlying diseases if any:\nGood control of blood pressure if accompanied by hypertension; Good control of blood sugar if you have diabetes; Treatment of hyperthyroidism (if any); Treatment of sleep apnea syndrome (if any)\nReference: What should you avoid eating with atrial fibrillation?\n\nPrevention of atrial fibrillation\nBuilding a healthy lifestyle is one of the methods that can reduce the risk of heart disease and can prevent atrial fibrillation. In addition, we can apply the following measures to prevent atrial fibrillation:\nWalk briskly 30 minutes a day and take the stairs when possible; Quit smoking: Heart rate and blood pressure return to normal 20 minutes after quitting smoking; Avoid or limit alcohol and caffeine; Control stress; Control high blood pressure; Regulate cholesterol levels: eat more fiber, olive oil, fish; Control blood sugar levels, especially if the person has diabetes\nDr. Huy recommends that older people, people with underlying cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, heart valve disease, stroke patients... can see an arrhythmia specialist for advice and treatment. Plan screening, thereby detecting early and thoroughly treating atrial fibrillation.\nCardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital is focused on investing in spacious facilities, owning the world's leading modern equipment system, gathering a team of leading experts in the field of cardiology. Vietnam provides comprehensive and effective examination, diagnosis and treatment services for cardiovascular problems for children and adults.\nArrhythmia Intervention Unit, Vascular Intervention Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, is capable of providing comprehensive care and treatment for patients with arrhythmia problems; In particular, there are many difficult and complicated cases such as: persistent and treatment-resistant multifocal atrial tachycardia; Refractory paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia causes hypotension and syncope; Multifocal ventricular extrasystole in hard-to-reach locations in the heart; Ventricular tachycardia causes fainting many times; Persistent atrial fibrillation or flutter causes heart failure; Severe arrhythmias associated with cardiac surgery; Severe arrhythmias in patients with complex congenital heart disease; Implantation of a myocardial synchronizer helps restore heart function in patients with severe heart failure...\nTo schedule an examination, consultation, and treatment of atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular diseases at Tam Anh General Hospital system, you can contact:\nPatients with atrial fibrillation can experience many serious cardiovascular complications if not detected early and treated promptly and properly. Therefore, cardiovascular experts recommend that each person should proactively have regular health check-ups, especially those with risk factors, or seek medical attention immediately when there are unusual signs.",
