Therefore, it is necessary to quickly determine the cause of hair loss to have appropriate treatment and regain beautiful, shiny, strong and healthy hair. So what is hair loss? The following 15 common causes and signs can help identify and thereby improve hair loss.\n\nWhat is hair loss?\nHair loss is a condition in which more hair falls out than grows every day. Hair loss can occur at any age. Most hair will fall out 100 strands per day. This is part of the hair growth cycle, new hair will grow and replace lost strands. When hair falls out more than 100 strands and does not grow back, this condition is called alopecia.\nThe connection between hair loss and baldness\nHair loss affects only the scalp or the entire body. This condition can be temporary or permanent. The cause of hair loss is often due to genetics, hormonal changes, medical treatment or aging. (first)\nBaldness is a result of excessive hair loss. Hereditary hair loss is a common cause of baldness. Many people feel self-conscious about baldness and choose to hide it by wearing wigs, hats or scarves. While others find baldness to be normal. (2)\n\nCauses of abnormal hair loss\nHair loss has many causes, including: (3)\n1. Hormonal changes\nPregnant women, during menopause or after giving birth, the hormones at these stages change suddenly, causing hair to thin due to hair follicles shrinking, causing hair to grow slowly and break more easily.\n2. Stress, tension, depression\nWhen in a state of stress, the body will produce free radicals that damage hair follicles, causing this part to rest prematurely, affecting the speed of hair growth, and even causing hair to fall out.\n3. Genetics\nHair loss can be hereditary. If someone in the family has hair loss leading to baldness, there is a high possibility that children will also encounter the same situation.\n4. Side effects of the drug\nDrugs used to dissolve blood clots, treat acne rich in vitamin A, anabolic steroids, treat arthritis, gout, depression drugs, treat heart disease or high blood pressure, drugs used in cancer chemotherapy... can cause hair loss. However, when you stop using these drugs, your hair will quickly grow back.\n5. Scalp fungus\nThe disease mainly occurs in children. The disease causes hair loss, but if properly examined and treated, hair will grow back quickly.\n6. Pull or apply strong force to the hair\nOccurs due to Trichotillomania addiction syndrome. Trichotillomania can lead to infections, skin damage and permanent hair loss. In extreme cases, some people avoid communication to hide their addiction to hair pulling.\n7. Polluted environment\nPolluted air, high humidity, and frequent exposure to sunlight cause dry scalp and frizzy hair that easily breaks.\n8. Wrong hair care\nDyeing, perming or straightening your hair can thin your hair. Over time, hair will break and fall out.\n9. Imbalanced nutrition\nIf the diet lacks iron, biotin or protein, the hair follicles are not provided with enough nutrients to nourish the hair, causing the hair to become dry, weak and prone to breakage.\n10. Chemicals\nOveruse of styling products such as perms and bleaches can cause damage, tangles, and hair loss.\n11. Poisoning\nArsenic, thallium, mercury and lithium. If a large amount of warfarin (a substance found in rat poison) is swallowed, it can also cause hair loss.\n12. Effects of chronic disease\nDiabetes, lupus, thyroid, scalp psoriasis, etc. Specifically, when you have diabetes, your blood vessels are easily damaged due to increased sugar levels. At this time, the amount of oxygen reaching the hair follicles is inhibited, inhibiting the growth of hair follicles, causing hair to break and fall out.\n13. Treatment methods\nChemotherapy or radiation therapy to the head and neck can cause total hair loss. Hair loss occurs as a secondary consequence of the use of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The degree of hair loss will vary depending on the medication being used, dosage and frequency of treatment. While some patients experience only mild hair loss, others may experience more severe hair loss.\n14. Age\nThe aging process causes many changes in the body's metabolic activity and a weakened immune system, making hair weak, prone to breakage and discoloration. Therefore, in middle age, gray hair begins to appear, hair falls out more, and becomes thinner than when young.\n15. Sexually transmitted infections\nSyphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases can cause hair loss in patches on the scalp, eyebrows, and beard.\n\nSigns of hair loss are easy to recognize\n1. Gradually thin on the top of the head\nThis is a common type of hair loss, common in older people. In men, hair begins to fall out from the hair above the forehead. For women, hair loss is often seen when the hairline recedes (or anterior fibrotic alopecia).\n2. Circular or patchy bald spots\nIn some cases, hair falls out in circular or patchy spots on the scalp. Before that, the skin may be itchy or painful before hair loss.\n3. Sudden hair loss\nPeople suffering from certain physical or mental shocks, psychological tension, and stress can cause hair to fall out suddenly and become brittle. A tuft of hair can fall out when combing, washing your hair, or even just pulling lightly. This condition often causes hair thinning but is only temporary.\n4. Hair loss all over the body\nTotal hair loss occurs while being treated with certain methods, such as chemotherapy.\n5. Scaly patches spread on the scalp\nScaly patches spreading on the scalp can be a sign of infection (bacteria, fungus, etc.). This condition causes hair loss along with redness, swelling and oozing.\n\nWhat risk factors increase the likelihood of hair loss?\nFactors that can increase the risk of hair loss include: (4)\nFamily history of baldness; Age.; Losing weight.; People with diabetes and lupus.; Stress, tension; Nutritional deficiencies.\nMost of the time, lost hair will grow back, however, some factors can hinder the hair growth process.\n\nDistinguish between physiological hair loss and pathological hair loss\nPhysiological hair loss and pathological hair loss are two completely different conditions and are distinguished by the following factors:\n1. Physiological hair loss\nPhysiological hair loss (life-cycle hair loss) is a condition in which hair grows and lengthens and gradually falls out over time. After hair falls out, a new layer of hair will grow to replace the old hair. On average, 30 - 100 hairs fall out every day and an equivalent amount of new hair grows. This is a normal physiological phenomenon and is nothing to worry about.\n2. Pathological hair loss\nWhen hair falls out more than 100 strands per day, the cause is unknown and it falls continuously over a long period of time. In some cases, hair loss is accompanied by itching, peeling skin, and many red spots. These may be signs of dermatological diseases leading to hair loss. Factors that cause hair to break easily include: neuroendocrine disorders, genetics, stress, nutritional imbalance, and inflammation.\n\nHair loss stage\nHair goes through 3 stages:\nAnagen phase (development phase): can last from 2 to 8 years. This stage usually accounts for about 85% - 90% of the hair on the head.; Catagen phase (transition phase): this is the time when hair follicles shrink, lasting 2 - 3 weeks; Telogen phase (resting phase): lasts 2 - 4 months. At the end of this phase, hair will begin to fall out.\nEyelashes, arm hair, leg hair and eyebrows have a short Anagen phase, about 1 month. While hair on the scalp can last up to 6 years or even longer.\n\nClassification of hair loss\nIn some cases, hair loss can be permanent, while in others it is temporary. Common types of hair loss:\n1. Hair loss without cause\nThis is a condition in which hair falls out and thins with age. Hair follicles enter the resting phase. Therefore, the hair will be shorter and less.\n2. Hair loss in men\nHair loss in men is often related to genes and male sex hormones. Accordingly, the hairline gradually moves backwards to form an M shape. A circular area at the back of the head (top) thins and expands in size over time. Finally, the hair becomes smooth, shorter, and thinner, while creating a U-shaped (or horseshoe) style around the sides of the head. (5)\n3. Hair loss in women\nAny girl or woman can experience hair loss. However, hair loss in women is often common in the following subjects:\nWomen over 40 years old.; Postpartum women; Patients using chemotherapy or affected by other drugs; People who often wear their hair in ponytails, tight braids, or use harsh chemicals to style their hair.; Women in menopause.\n4. Hair loss in patches (patchy)\nAlopecia areata is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks hair follicles. This causes hair to fall out in patches that are roughly the size and shape of a coin. The likelihood of alopecia areata is higher if a relative has this disease. In addition, alopecia areata is more common in people with family members suffering from autoimmune disorders such as diabetes, lupus or thyroid.\n5. Hair loss all over the body\nGeneralized hair loss is often seen in patients who are using chemotherapy to treat cancer.\n6. Trichotillomania\nTrichotillomania (or trichotillomania) is a mental disorder that involves repetitive urges to pull out hair, eyebrows, or hair from other areas of the body. Pulling hair often leaves patchy bald spots, causing discomfort for the patient and hindering communication and work activities.\nFor people with hair pulling addiction, this behavior may stem from:\nStress: deliberately pulling out hair to relieve stress; Voluntarily: pulling out your hair without realizing you're doing it, for example when you're bored.\n7. Telogen effluvium\nTelogen effluvium causes temporary hair loss that occurs due to stress or changes to the body. Acute telogen effluvium lasts less than 6 months, hair loss occurs 2-3 months after the body falls into a state of stress.\nChronic telogen effluvium lasts more than 6 months, the disease affects the entire scalp and has no obvious cause. Hair may fall out in patches in the early stages of chronic telogen effluvium. However, this condition does not cause complete baldness.\n8. Anagen effluvium\nAnagen effluvium is a condition of very rapid hair loss, occurring due to causes such as chemotherapy, infection, toxins, radiation or autoimmune diseases.\n9. Scarring alopecia leads to permanent hair loss\nScarring alopecia (alopecia areata) occurs when hair follicles are destroyed, often due to infection, chemical exposure, burns or autoimmune disorders. This condition can leave permanent scarring because hair cannot grow without healthy hair follicles. Scarring hair loss causes emotional and psychological effects, causing patients to have low self-esteem and guilt.\nThere are 2 types of scarring alopecia:\nPrimary scarring alopecia: inflammatory or autoimmune disorder that directly destroys hair follicles.; Secondary scarring hair loss: occurs due to complications of trauma or from damage to the skin.\nHair loss can occur at any age.\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nWhen experiencing the following situations, patients should see a doctor:\nItching or irritation on the scalp.; Too much hair falls out every day.; Sudden loss of a large amount of hair.\n\nHow to diagnose hair loss\nTo accurately diagnose the cause of hair loss, doctors will:\nDiscuss family medical history; Health status of the patient; Blood tests to check thyroid function and blood iron levels.; Check the scalp for signs of infection.; Scalp biopsy to check for skin diseases.\n\nHow to treat hair loss\nThere are many causes of hair loss, the doctor will base on each specific case to provide appropriate hair loss treatment:\n1. Treatment with medication\nUse a topical medication on the scalp, such as Minoxidil or Rogaine®. These two drugs are often used in the first treatment for thinning hair. Additionally, patients can use the prescription oral medications Finasteride or Propecia® (for men with baldness).\n2. Use natural methods\nTreat hair loss with grapefruit peel: essential oil from grapefruit peel stimulates growth, nourishes each hair follicle, helping hair grow long, beautiful and naturally strong. By cutting up the grapefruit peel, put it in a pot of boiling water, let it cool, then use that water to wash your hair.\nBesides, hair loss can be treated with coconut oil: this is an ingredient often found in shampoos or conditioners. With its moisturizing properties, coconut oil helps smooth hair, prevents tangles, and prevents breakage.\nUse aloe vera to improve hair loss: aloe vera contains vitamins A, C and E. All three vitamins contribute to cell regeneration, promote growth and make hair shiny. Vitamin B12 and folic acid found in aloe vera also help reduce hair loss, soothe itchy scalp, and treat seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff).\n3. Use hair transplant and laser methods\nDuring the hair transplant process, the doctor will remove hair from areas with thick hair. Then, those hairs will be transplanted into places with sparse or little hair.\nAdditionally, low-level laser therapy (or red light therapy, cold laser therapy) is used to treat hair loss, by irradiating photons into the scalp tissues. These photons are absorbed by cells to stimulate hair growth. Laser therapy is gradually becoming widely accepted because it is safe and less invasive than hair transplantation.\n4. Use products to help treat hair loss and stimulate hair growth\nUsing platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to help treat hair loss, by drawing blood and separating the plasma. The doctor will then inject platelet-rich plasma into the scalp. PRP treatment helps slow hair loss and encourages new hair growth. In addition, hair loss treatment methods can be mentioned such as PRP needle rolling and HA injections.\nDr. CKI Vo Thi Tuong Duy is injecting HA to treat hair loss and stimulate hair regrowth.\n\nEffective way to prevent hair loss\nTo prevent hair loss, patients should note the following:\nA healthy diet, fully supplemented with essential nutrients for the body; Limit tension and stress, keep a comfortable and cheerful mood; Check and screen for thyroid diseases or other autoimmune diseases; Avoid tying your hair too tightly; While having chemotherapy, try wearing a cooling cap.\n\nSome related questions about hair loss\n1. What should you eat and avoid if you have hair loss?\nHair lacking nutrients will not be strong and shiny. On the contrary, hair is often dry, easily damaged and broken. The following foods can stimulate growth and help strengthen hair, reducing breakage:\nThe fatty acids in salmon and tuna help stabilize the structure, provide moisture, and make hair strong and shiny. You should eat fatty fish (salmon, tuna) twice a week to keep your hair moist and not dry.; Eggs: source of protein and biotin.; Juicy fruits: contain many beneficial compounds and vitamin C that supports hair growth. Antioxidants found in berries  help protect hair follicles against damage from harmful molecules (free radicals).; Spinach: contains many nutrients such as folate, iron, vitamins A and C.; Sweet potatoes: provide beta carotene. The body converts this compound into vitamin A. Vitamin A deficiency can cause hair loss. However, it should be supplemented in moderation; Avocado: source of fat, vitamin E helps stimulate hair growth. Like vitamin C, vitamin E is an antioxidant that helps prevent stress and neutralize free radicals; Nuts.\nIn addition, you should avoid some of the following foods:\nFoods high in carbohydrates: refined grains, pasta, etc.; Fish has high levels of mercury.; Fried, greasy foods and red meat.\n2. Which vitamins should you take for hair loss?\nB vitamins especially vitamins B6, B12 and biotin! Vitamin B participates in the development process, helping hair grow quickly and strong. Deficiency of these vitamins will cause scalp inflammation and brittle hair. Specifically, you should add:\nVitamin B3: helps blood circulate easily to the scalp. Vitamin B3 is found in fish, chicken, and pork, so supplement 15mg of vitamin B3 per day.; Vitamin B5: prevents hair from graying and falling out. Vitamin B5 is found in cereals and egg yolks. Need to supplement 4mg - 7mg vitamin B5 every day.; Vitamin B6: prevents hair loss, strengthens melanin, helps hair stay black and shiny. Vitamin B6 is found in liver, cereals, green vegetables, and egg yolks. The amount of vitamin B6 needed per day is 1.6mg.; Vitamin B12: prevents hair loss, found in chicken, fish, eggs and milk. You should supplement 2mg of vitamin B12 every day.; Vitamin H (Biotin): produces keratin, prevents hair from graying and falling out. Food sources containing biotin are brewer's yeast, cereals, oats, eggs.; Vitamin E: helps regenerate skin, anti-aging. Not only is it effective for the skin, vitamin E also helps nourish the scalp and make hair shiny. Vitamin E is found in green vegetables, vegetable oils and soybeans; Inositol and vitamin C: help strengthen hair, found in beer yeast, citrus fruits, strawberries, kiwi, pineapple, tomatoes, potatoes and green vegetables.\n3. What is hair loss with white particles at the roots?\nWhen hair falls out, soft white granules appear at the roots, oval in shape, almost like acne. This condition is caused by staphylococcus proteus bacteria or trichophyton fungus. People with oily, sweaty scalps may be more susceptible to this condition.\n4. Why does hair fall out a lot when shampooing?\nWhen stimulating the scalp by washing or conditioning the hair, it causes the hair follicles to loosen, and the inherently weak and thin hair strands will easily break when exposed to force.\n5. Can lost hair grow back?\nHave! Hair loss every day is part of the hair's normal growth cycle. Most of the time, lost hair will grow back, however, factors such as hormonal changes, disease, stress, aging, and genetics can hinder the hair growth process.\nSpecialized in Dermatology - Skin Aesthetics, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, has high-end, specialized treatment services.

This stage usually accounts for about 85% - 90% of the hair on the head.; Catagen phase (transition phase): this is the time when hair follicles shrink, lasting 2 - 3 weeks; Telogen phase (resting phase): lasts 2 - 4 months. At the end of this phase, hair will begin to fall out.\nEyelashes, arm hair, leg hair and eyebrows have a short Anagen phase, about 1 month. While hair on the scalp can last up to 6 years or even longer."

            "subsection_content": "In some cases, hair loss can be permanent, while in others it is temporary. Common types of hair loss:\n1. Hair loss without cause\nThis is a condition in which hair falls out and thins with age. Hair follicles enter the resting phase. Therefore, the hair will be shorter and less.\n2. Hair loss in men\nHair loss in men is often related to genes and male sex hormones. Accordingly, the hairline gradually moves backwards to form an M shape. A circular area at the back of the head (top) thins and expands in size over time. Finally, the hair becomes smooth, shorter, and thinner, while creating a U-shaped (or horseshoe) style around the sides of the head. (5)\n3. Hair loss in women\nAny girl or woman can experience hair loss. However, hair loss in women is often common in the following subjects:\nWomen over 40 years old.; Postpartum women; Patients using chemotherapy or affected by other drugs; People who often wear their hair in ponytails, tight braids, or use harsh chemicals to style their hair.; Women in menopause.\n4. Hair loss in patches (patchy)\nAlopecia areata is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks hair follicles. This causes hair to fall out in patches that are roughly the size and shape of a coin. The likelihood of alopecia areata is higher if a relative has this disease. In addition, alopecia areata is more common in people with family members suffering from autoimmune disorders such as diabetes, lupus or thyroid.\n5. Hair loss all over the body\nGeneralized hair loss is often seen in patients who are using chemotherapy to treat cancer.\n6. Trichotillomania\nTrichotillomania (or trichotillomania) is a mental disorder that involves repetitive urges to pull out hair, eyebrows, or hair from other areas of the body. Pulling hair often leaves patchy bald spots, causing discomfort for the patient and hindering communication and work activities.\nFor people with hair pulling addiction, this behavior may stem from:\nStress: deliberately pulling out hair to relieve stress; Voluntarily: pulling out your hair without realizing you're doing it, for example when you're bored.\n7. Telogen effluvium\nTelogen effluvium causes temporary hair loss that occurs due to stress or changes to the body. Acute telogen effluvium lasts less than 6 months, hair loss occurs 2-3 months after the body falls into a state of stress.\nChronic telogen effluvium lasts more than 6 months, the disease affects the entire scalp and has no obvious cause. Hair may fall out in patches in the early stages of chronic telogen effluvium. However, this condition does not cause complete baldness.\n8. Anagen effluvium\nAnagen effluvium is a condition of very rapid hair loss, occurring due to causes such as chemotherapy, infection, toxins, radiation or autoimmune diseases.\n9. Scarring alopecia leads to permanent hair loss\nScarring alopecia (alopecia areata) occurs when hair follicles are destroyed, often due to infection, chemical exposure, burns or autoimmune disorders. This condition can leave permanent scarring because hair cannot grow without healthy hair follicles. Scarring hair loss causes emotional and psychological effects, causing patients to have low self-esteem and guilt.\nThere are 2 types of scarring alopecia:\nPrimary scarring alopecia: inflammatory or autoimmune disorder that directly destroys hair follicles.; Secondary scarring hair loss: occurs due to complications of trauma or from damage to the skin.\nHair loss can occur at any age.",

Additionally, patients can use the prescription oral medications Finasteride or Propecia® (for men with baldness).\n2. Use natural methods\nTreat hair loss with grapefruit peel: essential oil from grapefruit peel stimulates growth, nourishes each hair follicle, helping hair grow long, beautiful and naturally strong. By cutting up the grapefruit peel, put it in a pot of boiling water, let it cool, then use that water to wash your hair.\nBesides, hair loss can be treated with coconut oil: this is an ingredient often found in shampoos or conditioners. With its moisturizing properties, coconut oil helps smooth hair, prevents tangles, and prevents breakage.\nUse aloe vera to improve hair loss: aloe vera contains vitamins A, C and E. All three vitamins contribute to cell regeneration, promote growth and make hair shiny. Vitamin B12 and folic acid found in aloe vera also help reduce hair loss, soothe itchy scalp, and treat seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff).\n3. Use hair transplant and laser methods\nDuring the hair transplant process, the doctor will remove hair from areas with thick hair. Then, those hairs will be transplanted into places with sparse or little hair.\nAdditionally, low-level laser therapy (or red light therapy, cold laser therapy) is used to treat hair loss, by irradiating photons into the scalp tissues. These photons are absorbed by cells to stimulate hair growth. Laser therapy is gradually becoming widely accepted because it is safe and less invasive than hair transplantation.\n4. Use products to help treat hair loss and stimulate hair growth\nUsing platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to help treat hair loss, by drawing blood and separating the plasma. The doctor will then inject platelet-rich plasma into the scalp. PRP treatment helps slow hair loss and encourages new hair growth.
