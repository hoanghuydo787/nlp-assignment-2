Normal anatomy is due to damage and weakening of the fascial and ligamentous structures that support the pelvic floor. This is one of the most common pelvic floor disorders in pre- and postpartum women. (first)\nThe pelvic floor is a whole made up of 3 systems including the reproductive system (uterus and vagina), lower urinary system (urethra and bladder) and lower digestive system (rectum and anus). In addition, the pelvic floor also contains many nervous and vascular systems. That structure makes this a \"hammock\" formed from many interwoven fascia blocks. This mass of muscle fascia will firmly attach to the abdominal wall, pubic bone, iliac bone, lumbar spine and sacrum.\nThe main task of the pelvic floor muscles is to keep the organs in the right place, not falling down when moving, running or doing heavy work; Open and close the urinary tract, vagina and anus, control urination and defecation activities at will; Helps sublimate sex life, ease the birth process...\nWhen suffering from pelvic organ prolapse, the patient will experience symptoms of urination and defecation disorders; lower back pain or pressure or heaviness in the pelvic area; unusual vaginal bleeding; There is a bulge protruding from the vagina... causing serious effects on the patient's health as well as psychology.\nMSc. Nguyen Thi Thanh Tam, Obstetrician and Gynecologist, Obstetrics and Gynecology Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, said that pelvic organ prolapse is a \"hard to talk about\" disease, so when suffering from the disease, many women Women feel self-conscious, feel guilty, and try to endure the disease, causing the disease to prolong, risking complications that affect their health and quality of life. This causes the disease to progress more seriously, treatment to become expensive, and the opportunity to be completely cured is lost.\n\nTypes of pelvic organ prolapse\nPelvic prolapse can affect any of the pelvic organs such as the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, as well as the bladder and rectum.\nMSc. Nguyen Thi Thanh Tam shared that there are many different types of pelvic organ prolapse, specifically:\nBladder prolapse: The bladder forms a bulge in front of the vaginal wall; Sac-type rectal prolapse: The last segment of the large intestine (rectum) bulges, surpasses the back wall of the vagina, and even falls out of the anus with prolapse of the anal mucosa.; Small bowel prolapse: Part of the small intestine descends from the top of the vaginal vault, the prolapse contains the small intestine.; Urethral prolapse (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside): The urethra protrudes from the front of the vaginal wall.; Uterine prolapse: The uterus drops into the vagina. Grade 1 uterine prolapse: The uterus recedes insignificantly and has not yet exited the vagina, so the patient does not recognize the uterine prolapse. The patient may have early symptoms of back pain or frequent urination if accompanied by prolapse. bladder grade 1 to 2. Uterine prolapse grade 2: The uterus drops deep into the vagina, the cervix can be seen protruding at the entrance or outside the vaginal opening. Grade 3 uterine prolapse: Most of the uterus has fallen out of the vaginal opening. Grade 4 uterine prolapse: The entire uterus has fallen out of the vaginal opening.; Grade 1 uterine prolapse: The uterus recedes insignificantly and has not yet exited the vagina, so the patient does not recognize the uterine prolapse. The patient may have early symptoms of back pain or frequent urination if accompanied by prolapse. bladder grade 1 to 2.; Grade 2 uterine prolapse: The uterus drops deep into the vagina, the cervix can be seen protruding at or outside the vaginal opening.; Grade 3 uterine prolapse: Most of the uterus has fallen out of the vaginal opening.; Grade 4 uterine prolapse: The entire uterus has fallen out of the vaginal opening.; Vaginal vault prolapse: the vagina falls down spontaneously after hysterectomy, also known as cusp prolapse.\n\nCauses of pelvic organ prolapse\nThe most common cause of the disease is pregnancy and childbirth. Because during pregnancy from the last 3 months onwards, the weight of the fetus - uterus and increased pressure on the pelvic floor during labor and birth, the fascia muscles responsible for supporting the pelvic organs will relax. as much as possible to make childbirth easier, however this also causes the muscle fascia to quickly weaken or become damaged or torn. (2)\nExpansion and damage to the pelvic floor during pregnancy and childbirth are common causes of pelvic prolapse\nAnother reason to mention is the decrease in the concentration of the female hormone Estrogen in the pre- and post-menopausal period, causing the body to lack the amount of collagen needed to connect pelvic tissues.\nIn addition, some other causes include:\nChronic cough or exertion or straining due to constipation;; Obstetric trauma such as pushing when the cervix is ​​not fully dilated, giving birth during a traumatic procedure or tearing the perineum but not recovering properly;; Supporting tissues weaken when entering perimenopause and menopause;; Being overweight or obese, having large fibroids or having a history of pelvic surgery;; Doing heavy or strenuous work;; The pelvic floor fascia and ligaments are congenitally weak.\n\nCommon symptoms\nSigns of pelvic organ prolapse appear gradually and are difficult to detect in the early stages. At a mild level, the patient may feel a bulge inside the vagina. As the disease progresses to a more severe stage, the patient may experience symptoms such as:\nFeeling of tightness and heaviness in the lower abdomen and pelvis;; Feeling of swelling in the vagina, a tumor protruding outside the vagina;; Back pain symptoms gradually increase during the day;; Urinary incontinence;; Difficulty urinating and defecating;; Inconvenience in walking or sitting;; Bleeding, increased vaginal discharge (although not menstrual cycle);; Inability or difficulty having sex.\nThe condition can make a couple's sex life difficult\n\nDangerous complications\nMSc. Nguyen Thi Thanh Tam said that if pelvic organ prolapse is not treated early, the patient will suffer from urinary, gynecological and anorectal dysfunction. If the disease progresses seriously, especially level 4 uterine prolapse, it will cause ulcers, at which point a complete hysterectomy is needed.\nIt can be seen that, although it does not directly threaten the patient's life, pelvic organ prolapse will lead to serious complications, negatively affecting the quality of life, making the patient feel self-conscious and lacking confidence.\n\nDiagnostic method\nPelvic organ prolapse can be detected through routine gynecological examinations. To determine the extent and condition of the disease, the doctor will clinically examine the pelvic area and prescribe a number of necessary tests to support the most accurate diagnosis. (3)\nBladder function test: To check whether the bladder is leaking air containing urine or not, measure the level of emptying of the bladder, whether it contracts well or is obstructed, causing incomplete urination or urination. difficulty, complete urinary retention, thereby determining the appropriate treatment direction; Pelvic floor strength test: Exercises that test the strength of the fascia and pelvic floor to measure the support of the fascia and ligaments to organs such as the uterus, bladder, rectum, and urethra and vaginal wall.; Ultrasound: Uses high-frequency sound waves to visualize the kidneys, bladder and organs around the anus.; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Uses a magnetic field and radio waves to see detailed images of the structure of the pelvic floor and the anatomical location of whether or not the pelvic organs are prolapsed.\nPathology is detected through periodic gynecological health checks\n\nPelvic prolapse treatment\nMost cases of the disease have feelings of guilt and low self-esteem, leading to hesitation in not seeing a doctor and suffering for a long time, making the disease worse. With the continuous development and progress of modern medicine, there are more and more effective treatment methods for pelvic organ prolapse. Therefore, as soon as patients notice unusual symptoms, they should immediately go to a medical facility for timely and proper diagnosis, examination and treatment.\nMSc. Nguyen Thi Thanh Tam said that for mild cases of pelvic organ prolapse, patients are prescribed medical treatment, without the need to use surgical methods. Medical treatment includes pelvic floor exercises (Kegel, Bridge, Split Tabletop,...) to help strengthen the pelvic fascia, or placing a lifting ring (a removable device) inside the vagina to hold it in place. Locate prolapsed organs in the correct position.\nIn case surgery is necessary, the doctor will prescribe one of the following surgeries to return the prolapsed organ to its correct position: (4)\nVaginal wall repair surgery: Repairs prolapse in the front or back wall of the vagina, helping to treat prolapse that can include bladder prolapse, rectal prolapse, and shrinking a loose, dilated vagina.; Vaginal-perineal suture procedure: Repairs prolapse in the posterior wall of the rectum, or prolapse in the posterior wall of the small intestine.; Complete hysterectomy: Performed through the vagina to remove the uterus and correct the vagina.; Surgical treatment of vaginal vault prolapse: Aims to support the vaginal vault.\nTreatment regimens are individualized to suit each patient and different medical condition.\n\nPrevention\nTo take good care of pelvic floor health, as well as detect disease early and provide timely treatment intervention, it is recommended that women should:\nGet a gynecological health check-up, especially a pelvic floor check-up every 6 months. In case of treatment, it is necessary to have regular follow-up appointments to monitor disease progression, contributing to effective treatment and the best care.; Follow your doctor's treatment instructions exactly, do not arbitrarily use medication or use the wrong prescribed dosage.; Properly perform pelvic floor rehabilitation exercises according to your doctor's instructions.; Build a scientific diet, supplement adequate nutrients, especially eat lots of fruits and vegetables, supplement fiber, and drink plenty of water to prevent constipation.; Have a healthy lifestyle, especially not smoking because it can cause chronic cough; Maintain a balanced, appropriate weight, ensuring a healthy body.\nPelvic floor muscle training is one of the effective methods to support disease treatment as well as prevent recurrence\nObstetrics and Gynecology Center, Tam Anh General Hospital is one of the first units to develop procedures for examination, diagnosis and in-depth treatment of pelvic floor diseases.
