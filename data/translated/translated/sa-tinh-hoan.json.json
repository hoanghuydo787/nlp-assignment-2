    "content": "Testicular prolapse: Causes, symptoms and treatment\n\nTesticular prolapse is a common condition, associated with many diseases. This condition affects many men's sexual activities. Testicular prolapse is not a disease but a symptom of diseases that directly affect men's reproductive health.\n\nWhat is testicular prolapse?\nTesticular prolapse (dropping testicles) is a condition in which the size of the scrotum hanging from the testicles will be longer than the penis in its normal state. When a man sits, the scrotal skin cannot contract around the testicles as it normally does. The cause is that the scrotum stretches, causing the testicles to sag. (first)\nTesticles are an important part of male physiology. The endocrine function of the testicles is to regulate the hormone testosterone. The exocrine function of the testicles is to produce sperm. The testicles have two sides, connected and surrounded by the scrotum.\nIn adults, testicles are 4 - 4.5cm long and 2 - 2.5cm wide. In the natural state, the length of the testicles will be greater or equal to the penis when not erect.\n\nCauses of testicular prolapse\nTesticular prolapse has many negative impacts on men's mental health. Some causes of testicular prolapse include:\nOrchitis: The disease is characterized by high fever, uncomfortable pain, swelling in the testicles, making the testicles larger than normal, stretching the scrotum, leading to sagging. Orchitis, if there is no early intervention, can cause complications such as infection spreading to other areas such as prostatitis, nephritis...; Testicular torsion and varicocele: This is a condition in which the veins of the testicles become twisted or stretched. These diseases cause varicose veins in the testicles, causing blood to not circulate evenly, causing the testicles to increase in size, leading to testicular prolapse.; The scrotal skin is wider than the seminal vesicles: The scrotal skin is larger and does not hug the testicles tightly. The condition can cause unilateral or bilateral testicular prolapse; High temperature: The scrotum can contract or expand according to temperature. This is to maintain a stable internal environment for the testicles to develop. Warmer temperatures due to weather or exercise can cause the scrotal skin to stretch excessively.; Testicle size: Testicle size that is too large, exceeding the scrotum's ability to contract is also one of the causes of testicular sagging.; Hydrocele in the spermatic cord: When the spermatic suction tube is dysfunctional, it can cause hydrocele, causing the seminal vesicles to prolapse, leading to testicular sagging.; Cancer in the testicles: This is the most dangerous and serious disease in people with testicular prolapse. When cancer cells develop, they will create lymph nodes in the testicles, leading to increased testicular volume and size. At this time, the scrotum is under great pressure, making the sagging condition even more serious.; Inguinal hernia: This is an indirect cause of testicular prolapse. Inguinal hernia causes testicles to sag, causing pain in the scrotum, especially when walking and standing.; Damage to the testicular lining.\n\nSymptoms of testicular prolapse\nThe scrotum is stretched down and loose.; Seeing the scrotum stretch down, not shrinking for a long time, or the scrotal layer not shrinking immediately when exposed to cold temperatures. When contracted, the scrotal skin is firm but the scrotum still feels loose.; One of the testicles is enlarged; The upper part of the intestine is pulled down, gathering in the direction of the sagging testicle.; The size of the scrotum is getting bigger; Feeling unusually heavy in the lower body. When sagging, the testicles will increase in weight, causing men to feel pressure and discomfort in the lower abdomen.\n\nRisk factors that increase the likelihood of scrotal prolapse in men\nSome factors can increase the risk of testicular sagging such as:\nVaricocele: This is a condition in which the veins become twisted in the testicles. This condition deforms the testicles, causing pain to the patient. Twisted veins will cause poor blood circulation. In addition, when veins dilate too much, they can affect the genital organs. Patients often have testicular pain and have many difficulties in their sexual life; There may even be paralysis, premature ejaculation, decreased sperm quality...; Venous effusion: This is a condition in which the amount of fluid in the veins is stagnant, concentrated on only one side of the scrotal sac, causing the testicles to swell, become abnormally large, causing sagging; Damage to the testicular membrane: When damaged, the testicular membrane can cause blood to stagnate in the testicles, more seriously, pus. When not detected and treated early, men can suffer from orchitis and sagging sperm.; Wide scrotal skin: In normal men, the genital structure will have scrotal skin of sufficient size to hug the testicles. However, some men have the scrotal skin wider than the seminal vesicles, which leads to sagging testicles.; Testicular cancer: This disease can cause a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum. One testicle may be harder than the other. Patients may notice that the testicles grow larger, causing the scrotal skin to sag.\nTesticular cancer can cause severe damage to the scrotum, leading to testicular prolapse\n\nWhat disease does testicular prolapse indicate?\nTesticular prolapse can be a warning sign of certain diseases in men such as: (2)\n1. Orchitis\nThe disease usually appears in men over 30 years old. At that time, the testicles are invaded by harmful bacteria and cause infection. These bacteria often originate from the urethra and then travel upward through the vas deferens, causing infection in the testicles.\nCommon symptoms in patients with orchitis include testicular prolapse; bloody semen; pain when urinating, ejaculating, and having sex; Feeling heavy and stuck in the groin. Patients often experience fatigue and weakness, which may be accompanied by high fever. Serious cases may cause swelling, edema, and fluid accumulation in the testicles.\n2. Epididymitis\nThis is a condition in which the epididymis is swollen and inflamed due to infection or not. If treatment is delayed, men may experience infertility, impaired physiological function, and even impotence. Some cases of epididymitis can lead to other diseases such as prostatitis and urinary tract infections.\nPatients with epididymitis often have symptoms such as a warm, red, swollen scrotum; pain in one testicle (especially when urinating, ejaculating, and having sex); Pelvic or lower abdominal discomfort. Some accompanying symptoms may appear such as fluid and pus discharge from the penis, semen mixed with blood. Patients may experience fatigue, chills and high fever.\n3. Testicular torsion\nTesticular torsion is a condition in which the testicle twists at the end of the spermatic cord, causing loss of blood supply to the testicle, causing testicular damage, even necrosis. This disease is rare, usually due to trauma or unknown causes. Testicular torsion causes blood flow to the testicles to stop, leading to tissue damage, causing testicular prolapse.\n\nIs testicular prolapse dangerous?\nTesticles are an important part of male reproductive health. Therefore, when testicles sag, the functions of this part will be seriously affected, threatening men's ability to have sex, specifically:\nSperm quality and quantity are reduced, increasing the possibility of deformities, making it difficult to fertilize eggs, leading to a very high risk of infertility.; Increased risk of prostatitis.; When testicular prolapse occurs, the body will lack the hormone testosterone. This reduces men's desire and ability to have sex. At that time, the patient will be afraid of intimacy, gradually leading to a state of apathy and physiological weakness.\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nIf the cause of testicular prolapse is detected early, this symptom can be treated. Therefore, if you notice any differences in the genital organs such as swelling, drooping testicles accompanied by pain and pressure, men need to immediately go to reputable medical facilities for examination, diagnosis and treatment. suitable treatment methods.\n\nHow to treat scrotal prolapse in men\nTesticular prolapse can be cured if detected early. Mandatory indication is when men need to detect differences in the genital organs such as swelling, sagging testicles accompanied by pain and tightness. At this time, patients should quickly go to a hospital or reputable medical facility to be examined and diagnosed, thereby taking timely intervention measures to prevent dangerous complications.\nTreatment of testicular prolapse is usually based on the cause, specifically:\nDue to orchitis: In this case, medical treatment is often used. Patients will be prescribed specific medications, depending on the infection status; Due to varicocele and testicular torsion: These cases require surgical methods. Surgery will fix the varicose veins of the spermatic cord, helping blood flow to be normal and more stable.; Due to hernia in the groin: In this case, surgery combined with internal medicine is often prescribed to improve the condition quickly.; Due to testicular cancer: In this case, doctors often prescribe different methods, depending on the stage at which the patient is detected, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy or suitable biological agents.\n\nHow to prevent scrotal prolapse in men?\nTesticular prolapse is a natural part of the aging process. We have no way to completely prevent it. Even if cosmetic surgery is chosen, the scrotal skin will eventually begin to sag.(3)\nHowever, men can slow down the aging process in this part by:\nExercise regularly, about 30 minutes a day.; No smoking; Limiting alcohol intake.; Add plenty of vitamins A, B, C and E along with sorbitol and omega 3 fatty acids in your diet.; Drink plenty of water: Drink about 2 - 2.5 liters of water/day, depending on activity level.\nCenter for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology - Urology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts, Internal Medicine and Surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.

Diagnosis - medical and surgical treatment of all diseases.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Center for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology - Urology, Tam Anh General Hospital System, you can make an appointment online through the following ways:\nIn addition to being a natural sign of aging, testicular prolapse is also considered a sign of dangerous diseases in the male genital organs. There are many methods proposed to handle this situation. Among them, the most common treatment is based on the cause. To ensure safety, men who have unusual signs in their genitals should go to reputable medical facilities for examination and diagnosis for timely intervention.",
