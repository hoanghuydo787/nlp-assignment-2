Necrosis, or strangulated rectal tissue that decomposes and dies, can also be life-threatening. MSc. Dr. Nguyen Van Hau advises that people should not be subjective about rectal prolapse. Understanding the disease can help prevent and treat rectal prolapse effectively.\n\nWhat is rectal prolapse?\nRectal prolapse is a condition in which part of the rectum falls or slips out of the anus. The rectum is the last part of the large intestine and is where stool is stored before being excreted. (first)\nThere are three types of rectal prolapse:\nExternal prolapse: The total thickness of the rectal wall prolapses outside the anus. This is the most common type of rectal prolapse.; Mucosal prolapse: Part of the rectal mucosa prolapses outside the anus.; Internal prolapse: The rectum has begun to prolapse but has not yet prolapsed outside the anus.(2)\nRectal prolapse tends to become more noticeable over time. Treatment of rectal prolapse will depend on gender, age, general health and the cause, extent of prolapse, and paraclinical results.\n\nCauses, factors/risks and related conditions\nAlthough the specific cause of rectal prolapse has not been found, doctors believe that it is largely due to factors including:\nPregnant; History of chronic diarrhea or constipation; Old age weakens muscles and ligaments in the rectal area; Previous injury to the anal or hip area; Nerve damage affects the muscle's ability to tighten and loosen. This can be caused by pregnancy, complications of vaginal birth, paralysis of the anal sphincter, or injury to the spine or back; have neurological problems, such as spinal cord disease or spinal cord resection, herniated disc, multiple sclerosis, etc.\n\nSymptoms of rectal prolapse\nAt first, the patient may only notice a lump or swollen tissue protruding from the anus during bowel movements and can be pushed back inside with his hand. However, over time, the tumor/tissue may prolapse outside the anus permanently and cannot be pushed back inside.\nLong-term rectal prolapse will occur more often when the patient coughs, sneezes or stands up. Sometimes, rectal prolapse may feel like “sitting on a ball” or like incomplete bowel movements.\nIn addition, rectal prolapse can also have other symptoms such as difficulty controlling bowel movements, bright red blood flowing from the rectum, discomfort and possibly constipation. (3)\n\nComplications of rectal prolapse\nLong-term untreated rectal prolapse can lead to complications ranging from mild to serious, affecting the patient's health. Among them, the most common are 3 complications including: (4)\nProlapse: A part of the rectum becomes trapped and cuts off its blood supply, causing tissue to die, leading to complications of spasm. This complication can develop into gangrene, causing the rectum to turn black and fall off. This is a serious complication that requires surgery or it will be life-threatening.; Prolapse: A part of the rectum becomes trapped and cuts off its blood supply, causing tissue to die, leading to complications of spasm. This complication can develop into gangrene, causing the rectum to turn black and fall off. This is a serious complication that requires surgery or it will be life-threatening.\nSolitary rectal ulcer syndrome: When mucosal prolapse occurs, ulcers may develop on the protruding part of the rectum. This complication also requires surgery.; Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome: When mucosal prolapse occurs, ulcers may develop on the protruding part of the rectum. This complication also requires surgery.\nRecurrence of rectal prolapse: Many cases of rectal prolapse recur after surgery.; Recurrence of rectal prolapse: Many cases of rectal prolapse recur after surgery.\nNecrosis of prolapsed intestinal mass; Necrosis of prolapsed intestinal mass\n\nMethods of diagnosing rectal prolapse\nTo diagnose rectal prolapse, the doctor will review the patient's medical history and ask about symptoms, then conduct a physical examination. During a physical examination, the doctor will insert a gloved finger and lubricant into the rectum to examine. Besides, the doctor may also ask the patient to sit on the toilet to defecate. This will help the doctor see the prolapse.\nDoctor Hau said that at Tam Anh Hospital there is a video recording system when patients are defecating, including a specialized camera installed on the toilet and a remote control computer system to diagnose rectal prolapse. exactly 100%.\nSpecialized camera installed on toilet seat\nIn addition, patients may also be asked to do some other, more advanced tests to diagnose rectal prolapse, especially for people with medical conditions. Tests include:\nX-ray: An X-ray will show the rectum and anal canal while the patient defecates.; X-ray: An X-ray will show the rectum and anal canal while the patient defecates.\nColonoscopy: A long tube is inserted into the rectum with a small camera on the end to look for any problems that could be causing prolapse; Colonoscopy: A long tube is inserted into the rectum with a small camera on the end to look for any problems that could cause prolapse.\nEndometrial ultrasound: A probe is inserted into the anus and rectum to examine the muscles and tissues.; Endometrial ultrasound: A probe is inserted into the anus and rectum to examine muscles and tissues.\nSigmoidoscopy: Uses a long tube with a camera on the end to go deep into the intestines to look for inflammation, scarring or tumors.; Sigmoidoscopy: Uses a long tube with a camera on the end to go deep into the intestines to look for inflammation, scarring or tumors.\nMRI: Takes images to examine all organs in the patient's pelvic region.; MRI: Takes images to examine all organs in the patient's pelvic region.\nAnal manometry: A thin tube is inserted into the rectum to test muscle strength; Anal manometry: A thin tube is inserted into the rectum to test muscle strength.\nAnal electromyography (EMG): This method helps check whether nerve damage is causing problems with the anal sphincter.; Anal electromyography (EMG): This method helps check whether nerve damage is causing problems with the anal sphincter.\nDorsal nerve terminal motor latency test: This method helps test the dorsal nerve that plays a role in controlling intestinal motility.; Dorsal nerve terminal motor latency test: This method helps test the dorsal nerve, which plays a role in controlling intestinal motility.\n\nTreatment methods for rectal prolapse\nRectal prolapse can be treated with one of the following methods:\n1. Treatment with medication\nIf rectal prolapse is mild, the patient can be treated with stool softeners and fiber supplements as prescribed by the doctor. Medications to treat rectal prolapse will soften stools to help patients defecate more easily. However, drug treatment is only a temporary solution and cannot cure rectal prolapse, so doctors advise patients to have rectal prolapse surgery as soon as possible.\n2. Physical therapy treatment\nSupportive physical therapy before and after rectal prolapse surgery is a unique feature of the Anorectal Unit at Tam Anh Hospital. Physical therapy aims to strengthen the anal and pelvic floor muscles and restore defecation reflexes. The patient will receive electrical stimulation in the anus combined with biofeedback and Kegel exercises.\n3. Surgical treatment\nThe most common treatment for rectal prolapse is surgery to put the rectum back in place. The type of surgery a patient is offered will depend on factors such as overall health, age, and the severity of the rectal prolapse. There are currently two most common types of surgery commonly applied to patients with rectal prolapse including:\nAbdominal surgery: Doctors can operate using traditional surgery or laparoscopic surgery to suspend the prolapsed rectum into the sacred bone.; Abdominal surgery: Doctors can operate using traditional surgery or laparoscopic surgery to suspend the prolapsed rectum into the sacred bone.\nPerineal surgery: Altemeier surgery: cutting the rectum through the anus - connecting the rectum and anal canal. Perineal surgery aims to affect the inner lining of the rectum or the part of the rectum that has prolapsed outside the anus to return them to their original state.; Perineal surgery: Altemeier surgery: cutting the rectum through the anus - connecting the rectum and anal canal. Perineal surgery aims to affect the inner lining of the rectum or the part of the rectum that has prolapsed outside the anus to return them to their original state.\nThiersch surgery: Suture and place around the anal canal with a silicone thread for the purpose of strengthening the sphincter - often used in rectal prolapse due to sphincter laxity.; Thiersch surgery: Suture and place around the anal canal with a silicone thread for the purpose of strengthening the sphincter - often used in rectal prolapse due to sphincter laxity.\nInjecting stem cells into the sphincter musculature is a future direction to restore the sphincter musculature - the cause of rectal prolapse. Stem cells are cells taken from mesenchymal cells of the bone marrow - or umbilical cord cells - when injected into the sphincter muscle, they will differentiate into striated muscle cells of the anal sphincter.; Injecting stem cells into the sphincter musculature is a future direction to restore the sphincter musculature - the cause of rectal prolapse. Stem cells are cells taken from mesenchymal cells of the bone marrow - or umbilical cord cells - when injected into the sphincter muscle, they will differentiate into striated muscle cells of the anal sphincter.\n\nMeasures to prevent rectal prolapse\nAccording to Dr. Hau, rectal prolapse is mainly caused by improper diet and lifestyle. Therefore, to prevent rectal prolapse, people should try not to strain when defecating; avoid constipation; increase fiber in the diet such as eating more green vegetables and fruits; Drink 2 liters of water every day; exercise regularly; avoid obesity; Avoid heavy lifting because this can put pressure on the intestinal muscles, easily leading to rectal prolapse. In addition, people should have regular health check-ups to screen and detect diseases early.\n\nFrequently asked questions about rectal prolapse\n1. How is rectal prolapse different from hemorrhoids?\nRectal prolapse is easily confused with hemorrhoids because both affect the last part of the intestine and have similar symptoms.\nRectal prolapse affects the rectal wall, while hemorrhoids affect the blood vessels in the anal canal. These two conditions require different treatment, so it is important that the patient receives an accurate diagnosis.\n2. Can rectal prolapse be completely cured?\nIf treated early and properly, most patients will completely recover from rectal prolapse. But there is also a group of people whose disease can relapse after surgery.\n3. How long does it take to fully recover after rectal prolapse surgery?\nNormally, the patient will recover completely within 3 months if given good care and abstinence.\nAlthough rectal prolapse is usually not an urgent medical problem, it causes discomfort and embarrassment and affects the patient's daily activities. Therefore, when noticing any signs or symptoms of rectal prolapse, patients should see a doctor as soon as possible. The longer the delay in treating rectal prolapse, the more likely the patient is to develop permanent problems, such as urinary incontinence and nerve damage, recommends Dr. Nguyen Van Hau.\nTam Anh Hospital is a reputable unit for examining and treating digestive diseases, including rectal prolapse. Customers will be examined and advised on appropriate hemorrhoid treatment methods by anorectal and rectal specialists with many years of experience, instructions on diet and lifestyle specifically for hemorrhoid patients, and anal exercises. , anal wound care for surgical patients and methods to limit hemorrhoid recurrence. In particular, the Anorectal Unit of the Gastrointestinal Endoscopy & Surgery Center also performs hemorrhoid treatment for special subjects such as children and pregnant women using separate methods.\nTo learn about the costs of examination, treatment, and surgery for digestive diseases, please contact: Tam Anh General Hospital System, Hanoi: 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Bo De Ward, Long Bien District, City.
