    "content": "Uterine prolapse during pregnancy: Causes, signs, treatment\n\nUterine prolapse during pregnancy is a rare condition with an incidence of 1/10,000-15,000 pregnant women. This number has decreased further worldwide over the past few decades, possibly due to a decline in birth rates. However, in developing countries, this number is still high due to malnutrition, multiple births and close spacing between consecutive births.\n\nWhat is uterine prolapse during pregnancy?\nUterine prolapse during pregnancy or vaginal prolapse during pregnancy is often rare. This is a phenomenon in which the uterus drops into the vagina, sometimes completely outside the vagina due to stretching and weakening of the ligaments, leading to infertility. can support the uterus. (first)\nUterine prolapse during pregnancy can lead to dangerous complications for mother and fetus\nUterine prolapse (vaginal prolapse) can occur in any trimester. This condition usually improves in the second trimester without any complications due to the growth of the uterus. The disease is first detected during pregnancy, usually in the 2nd or 3rd trimester. Uterine prolapse can cause discharge, cervical enlargement, ulceration and bleeding.\n\nCauses of uterine prolapse during pregnancy\nWhy does uterine prolapse occur during pregnancy and whether this condition can be restored to normal or almost normal is still a big question. However, according to experts, among the causes, having many children may be the main risk factor. (2)\nWomen with a history of pelvic floor trauma or congenital pelvic floor dysfunction are at risk of developing this condition. Uterine prolapse that develops during pregnancy is most likely due to the development of physiological changes during pregnancy that lead to weakening of the supporting structures of the pelvic organs. Pregnancy itself can cause prolapse. Increased cortisol and progesterone levels during pregnancy may contribute to relaxation of the uterine suspensory ligaments. Damage to the genitals due to multiple pregnancies and labor are factors that easily lead to uterine prolapse.\nOther factors may include prolonged labor or difficult birth, a long or enlarged cervix, which will be heavier than a normal cervix, pulling the uterus down. Some common risk factors include age, obesity, congenitally weak pelvic floor muscle support system, increased abdominal pressure, pelvic tumors, pelvic trauma... Rarely does this condition occur in people have never been pregnant.\n\nClassify\nIncomplete uterine prolapse: is a condition in which part of the uterus enters the vagina but does not completely exit the vagina.; Complete uterine prolapse: is a condition in which the uterus moves so far from its original position that part of it appears outside the vaginal opening.\n\nStages of uterine prolapse\nUterine prolapse during pregnancy is divided into 4 levels equivalent to 4 stages depending on the degree of uterine prolapse, including:\nStage I: The uterus is located in the upper half of the vagina;; Stage II: The uterus has descended almost to the vaginal opening or 1cm or more inwards from the vaginal opening;; Stage III: The uterus slides down and protrudes largely out of the vagina, but the distance from the prolapse to the edge of the hymen does not reach the entire length of the vagina;; Stage IV: This is the most severe stage when the entire uterus prolapses completely out of the vagina to the entire length of the vagina.\n\nSigns of uterine prolapse during pregnancy\nUsually, the symptoms that pregnant women with uterine prolapse often experience are heaviness in the lower abdomen, a feeling of heaviness in the vagina and vulva, accompanied by back pain. However, in the early stages, these symptoms are still not specific, the pain may be similar to normal pain during pregnancy, leading to difficulty in diagnosis.(3)\nBesides, pregnant mothers experience some difficulties in the process of defecation and urination, feeling like they need to urinate but cannot go or feeling like something is about to fall out of the vagina. If pregnant women experience symptoms such as vaginal bleeding, defecation, difficulty urinating, urinary retention or constipation, they should immediately go to a medical facility with obstetrics expertise for timely examination.\n\nComplications of uterine prolapse during pregnancy\nUterine prolapse during pregnancy can cause complications before birth, during childbirth and after birth. Prenatal complications include preterm labor, miscarriage, stillbirth, urinary tract infection, acute urinary retention, and even maternal death.\nThe main medical complications include the inability to fully dilate the cervix, as well as cervical tears, cessation of labor, changes in axis, unfavorable cervical orientation for birth, and the above complications. The mother's health causes urinary retention, urinary tract infections, hemorrhoids, and constipation that can cause miscarriage, premature birth, or stillbirth if the infection occurs and is not treated promptly. Postpartum infection and postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony are common consequences of postpartum uterine prolapse.\n\nDiagnostic method\nTo diagnose uterine prolapse during pregnancy, your doctor may do some tests such as examining the vagina and uterus. During the pelvic floor exam, your doctor may ask you to perform the same pushing movements as you do when you go to the bathroom, to assess the extent of the condition. In addition, the doctor will also check the strength of the pelvic floor muscles through activities such as the ability to contract strongly or weakly and relax the muscles... (4)\n\nTreatment of uterine prolapse during pregnancy\nThe doctor will consider choosing a method to treat uterine prolapse during pregnancy, according to the degree of prolapse and the pregnant woman's requirements. Besides, pregnant mothers need to note:\nCleaning the private area and resting in a comfortable position, changing position every 2 hours is also recommended and attention should be paid to circulatory stagnation when lying for a long time causing lightheadedness, dizziness and even fainting. ; Using a cervical support ring (pessary) placed in the vagina is considered a safe and effective treatment, non-invasive, no bleeding.; Follow your doctor's regimen and advice and do not miss any of your doctor's scheduled visits.; Practice pelvic floor exercises instructed by your doctor even after giving birth to help your pelvic floor function recover quickly and stay healthy. If you feel you are not exercising correctly or have questions about exercises to treat uterine prolapse, you should contact your doctor for instructions.\nSee more: Kegel exercises for men and women\nAvoid vigorous exercise and do not squat for long periods so that pressure does not accumulate on the abdomen.; In most pregnancies where mothers have uterine prolapse, vaginal birth or cesarean section should still follow the doctor's obstetric instructions. If labor is closely monitored and goes smoothly, vaginal birth will not be a cause of worsening vaginal prolapse. However, if a pregnant woman's labor lasts long or stops progressing due to the swelling of the cervix opening slowly or not opening further, the doctor should immediately prescribe a cesarean section; Clean the private area with clean water and use antiseptics only when prescribed by a doctor.\n\nPrecautions\nEarly diagnosis is important for a safe pregnancy. To prevent the risk of uterine prolapse during pregnancy, pregnant mothers should pay attention to the following issues:\nIf you intend to become pregnant, you should have a general health check to ensure a healthy pregnancy, and be fully vaccinated, especially those before pregnancy such as rubella vaccine, and Vaccination vaccine. prevent cervical cancer.... Because when your body is weakened by infection, the pelvic floor structure that supports the uterus also weakens.; Have regular prenatal checkups according to your doctor's appointment, monitor your health regularly. If there are health or psychological abnormalities as well as physical changes that concern you, you should immediately see a doctor for advice. ; During pregnancy and postpartum, you should limit heavy and excessive work; Mothers with a history of multiple pregnancies need to have their pregnancy closely monitored by a doctor.; Choose reputable obstetric examination facilities; Do not abuse medication or arbitrarily stop medication without a doctor's prescription.; Maintain ideal weight.; Do some gentle exercises, you can talk to your doctor for detailed instructions.; Drink lots of water, use foods rich in vitamins, fresh fruits, green vegetables in daily meals, avoid processed foods to limit constipation.; Pregnant mothers need to monitor their pregnancy regularly. When there are unusual symptoms, they should immediately contact an obstetrician for support.\nGathering a team of doctors and nurses who are leading experts in the field, equipped with modern machinery systems, close coordination of the \"three-legged stool\" Gynecology - Urology - Anorectal..., Obstetrics and Gynecology Center Department, Tam Anh General Hospital provides comprehensive, professional pelvic floor health examination services, individualized treatment regimens built specifically for each patient, doctors and medical staff.
