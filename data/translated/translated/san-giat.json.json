    "content": "Eclampsia: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis and prevention\n\nEclampsia – one of the dangerous obstetric complications, can appear at any time during pregnancy, causing deep coma, even threatening the lives of both the pregnant woman and the fetus if not promptly intervened. Experts in the field of reproductive health say that there are many causes of death for pregnant women during pregnancy, most of which are due to diseases or complications during pregnancy and childbirth such as hemorrhage, complications, and complications during pregnancy. Symptoms of toxic pregnancy such as preeclampsia - eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, postpartum infection... Statistics in Vietnam show that eclampsia accounts for about 10.7 - 18.4% of deaths in pregnant women. . Warning: 6+ most common obstetric complications that pregnant mothers need to pay attention to!!! See detailed article here.\n\n\nThe disease causes convulsions, deep coma, and even threatens the life of pregnant women if not promptly intervened\n\nWhat is eclampsia?\nEclampsia (Eclampsia in English) is a complication of severe preeclampsia, at which time pregnant women experience severe seizures or deep coma of unknown cause. Seizures can occur before birth, at 20 weeks of pregnancy, during birth or after birth, especially in pregnant women who have had signs and symptoms of preeclampsia.\nEclampsia often follows preeclampsia, characterized by elevated blood pressure that occurs during pregnancy and after birth. However, postpartum cases are more rare. When the pregnant woman's condition becomes severe, affecting the brain leading to seizures, the pregnant woman has eclampsia.\n\nCause of eclampsia\nObstetric experts say that preeclampsia is the leading cause of eclampsia in pregnant women (1). Pregnant women will enter eclampsia when symptoms such as convulsions, deep coma, etc. appear.\nThe cause of the disease may stem from abnormalities in the formation and function of the placenta. Blood flow to the placenta is reduced, limiting the nourishment of the fetus. Explaining this phenomenon, experts say it may stem from the following reasons:\n1. High blood pressure\nComplications occur when a pregnant woman's blood pressure increases, the force of blood transfusion on the artery wall is not large enough, affecting the arteries and other blood vessels. This phenomenon can cause swelling of blood vessels in the brain and growing fetus in the abdomen. Abnormal blood flow will hinder the brain's ability to function, which can cause seizures - a characteristic symptom of eclampsia.\nIt is recommended to control pregnant women's blood pressure at a stable level to prevent the risk of this obstetric complication\n2. Proteinuria\nThe disease can affect kidney function. Normally, the kidneys filter waste from the blood and create urine. However, the kidneys will retain nutrients in the blood such as proteinuria (protein in urine) to redistribute to the body. When the glomerulus - the kidney's filter - is damaged, protein can leak and be excreted into the urine. Therefore, the doctor may prescribe a urine sample from the pregnant woman to test for protein.\n\nSymptoms of postpartum eclampsia are common\nMSc. Dinh Thi Hien Le said that because it is the cause of eclampsia, pregnant women may experience signs of pre-eclampsia such as:\nHigh blood pressure;; Swelling (edema), especially in the face, hands, and feet;; Headache;; Uncontrolled weight gain;; Nausea, vomiting, vomiting;; Abdominal pain, especially in the upper right abdomen;; Difficulty in urination;; Vision problems such as blurred vision and loss of vision.\nHowever, M.D. Dinh Thi Hien Le emphasized, \"Sick pregnant women may have the above symptoms, but there are also cases where pregnant women do not experience any symptoms but immediately experience dangerous symptoms of diseases such as convulsions, deep coma, gradual loss of consciousness. Therefore, it is recommended that pregnant women have regular prenatal check-ups as prescribed by their doctors, early screening for disease risks, and preventing dangerous pregnancy complications from occurring.\"\nPregnant women with the disease may have early symptoms of preeclampsia\n\nWhich pregnant women are at high risk of eclampsia?\nMSc. Dr. Dinh Thi Hien Le said that all pregnant women with preeclampsia or a history of the disease are at risk of having seizures.\nIn addition, some other subjects at high risk of getting the disease include:\nPregnant women with gestational or chronic hypertension;; Pregnant women over 35 years old or under 20 years old;; Pregnant women pregnant with twins or triplets;; Pregnant woman pregnant for the first time;; Pregnant women with gestational diabetes or other conditions affecting blood vessels;; Pregnant women with kidney disease.\n\nDangerous complications\nPreeclampsia and eclampsia during pregnancy both impact the placenta – the organ that provides oxygen and nutrients from the mother's blood to nourish the fetus. When blood pressure increases, blood flow through blood vessels decreases, and the placenta does not receive enough nutrients to function normally. At this time, to preserve the lives of both the pregnant woman and the fetus, the doctor may instruct the pregnant woman to terminate the pregnancy. The fetus is born early, has a low birth weight, and is at risk of other health problems.\nWorld medical history records that in some rare cases the disease can cause pregnant women to have a stroke or even death; underdeveloped fetus, premature birth and stillbirth.\nThe disease can lead to dangerous complications for the fetus such as poor development, premature birth or stillbirth\n\nDiagnostic method\nM.D. Dinh Thi Hien Le said, \"For pregnant women with a history or diagnosis of preeclampsia, doctors will prescribe tests to determine the risk of recurrence or severe progression. For pregnant women who have never had the disease, the doctor can prescribe necessary tests to determine the risk of the pregnant woman having this syndrome or not.\nThese tests include:\n1. Blood test\nThe doctor may prescribe some necessary blood tests to evaluate the pregnant woman's condition. Tests include a complete blood count, measuring the amount of red blood cells in the blood, and platelet counts to determine blood clotting.\nIn addition, blood tests also help check the function and status of pregnant women's liver and kidneys.\n2. Creatinine test\nCreatinine is a waste product created by muscle metabolism. The kidneys will filter all creatinine from the blood. If the glomerulus is damaged, the risk of excess creatinine in the blood is very high (2). Excessive residue of this substance in a pregnant woman's blood can be one of the signs of preeclampsia - eclampsia.\n3. Urine test\nYour doctor may prescribe a urine test to check for proteinuria, as well as the excretion rate of this organ.\n\nEclampsia treatment methods\nMs. Dinh Thi Hien Le, MSc., said that based on the severity of preeclampsia and the maturity of the fetus, the doctor will prescribe the most appropriate treatment.\n1. In case the disease is mild\nIn this case, the doctor may prescribe monitoring of the pregnant woman's health condition, combined with drug treatment to prevent the disease from progressing to eclampsia, keeping the pregnant woman and fetus in a \"safe frame\" for until the fetus is mature enough to be born.\nPregnant women are closely monitored to ensure safety for fetal development\n2. In case of serious medical condition\nWhen a pregnant woman experiences serious complications, her doctor may advise her to terminate her pregnancy. The fetus may be born prematurely, and the preterm infant care plan prescribed depends on the length of pregnancy and the severity of the illness.\nBesides, controlling blood pressure during pregnancy is very important. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends antihypertensive treatment for pregnant women with systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 110mmHg (3). Controlling blood pressure is also important for about 48 hours after giving birth because the risk of pregnant women experiencing eclampsia is highest. Therefore, systolic blood pressure should be controlled < 150mmHg and diastolic blood pressure < 100mmHg on two occasions, read at least 4 hours apart.\n3. Medicines to treat eclampsia\nYour doctor may prescribe certain medications to prevent seizures in pregnant women, called anticonvulsants. In addition, pregnant women also need to use medicine in case of high blood pressure.\n\nCare of pregnant women\nM.D. Dinh Thi Hien Le recommends that pregnant women diagnosed with this syndrome as well as family members need to be equipped with knowledge and consult a doctor to have a healthy pregnancy. , safe. In case the pregnant woman has unusual signs, the family needs to take the pregnant woman immediately to a medical facility for timely diagnosis and treatment to avoid unfortunate incidents from occurring.\n\nHow to prevent disease?\nTo prevent dangerous complications of the disease, it is recommended that pregnant women diagnosed with preeclampsia should pay attention to the following issues:\nCarry out regular and scheduled prenatal check-ups, especially important prenatal check-up milestones; Have a scientific diet, supplemented with nutrients for pregnant mothers and fetuses to develop well.; Monitor and record changes in blood pressure, weight, urine, etc. daily to detect abnormalities early; Notify your doctor immediately when your body has unusual symptoms for timely treatment.\nEstablish a scientific nutritional regimen to provide adequate nutrition during pregnancy\n\nfrequently asked Questions\nBelow are questions that many pregnant women are interested in, sent to Tam Anh General Hospital:\n1. If you have had pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, is there a risk of getting it again? How to avoid?\nPreeclampsia can occur in pregnant women with a history of diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), kidney disease, obesity, diabetes, older women, etc. during the 20th week of pregnancy. In case the pregnant woman has a history of previous illness, the risk of recurrence is also quite high. However, pregnant women can recognize signs of blood pressure or high protein levels in urine at an early stage if they have regular check-ups. In addition, \"biomarkers\" can predict the risk of disease for pregnant women.\nSee more specific answers from Associate Professor, Dr. Luu Thi Hong - Head of Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Tam Anh General Hospital on this issue\nWith the desire to provide safe, 5-star prenatal examination and birth services, preventing dangerous obstetric complications such as eclampsia, twin blood transfusions, amniotic embolism, etc. Tam Anh General Hospital deploys pregnancy services package product.
