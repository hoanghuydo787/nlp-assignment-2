    "content": "Lung fluke disease: Signs, causes, treatment, prevention\n\nMany localities in Vietnam have recorded people with lung fluke disease such as An Giang, Nghe An, Hoa Binh, Lai Chau, Son La, Lao Cai, Ha Giang... These patients have habits or lifestyles and customs. eating uncooked shrimp and crab, making salads, rare dishes... So what is lung fluke disease, is this disease dangerous?\n\nWhat is a lung fluke?\nLung fluke (Paragonimus spp.) is a species of flatworm that lives parasitically in the human lungs, specifically the bronchioles. People get sick from eating shrimp and crabs infected with lung fluke larvae that are not cooked. Flukes can move to the central nervous system, causing meningitis. (first)\nThere are up to 40 different species of lung flukes, but only more than 10 species cause disease in humans. In other countries, the main disease-causing species is Paragonimus westermani, in Vietnam it is Paragonimus heterotremus.\n1. Physical characteristics\nAdult flukes: lung flukes are 7-13 mm long, 4-6 mm wide, the size of peanuts or coffee beans.; Lung fluke eggs: 80 - 120 µm long - 4-8 µm wide, with dark brown color, oval shape, lid, thick shell, containing embryo inside.; Larvae: adult lung flukes must go through many different larval stages, from hairy larvae to tailed larvae and cystic larvae before becoming adult flukes.; Reproduction: lung flukes are hermaphrodites, hermaphrodites, having both male and female genitals.\n2. Biological characteristics\nReservoir: humans are the main hosts for parasitic lung flukes, in addition some animals such as dogs, pigs, cats... can still be infected.; When infecting humans: After 2-15 days, the patient appears initial symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. The next few days included fever, chest pain and fatigue. In addition, some people have a dry cough, a cough with rust-colored or blood-tinged phlegm when the cough is severe, and coughs more often like people with tuberculosis.; Pathophysiology: Lung flukes nest in the lungs, causing localized necrosis of the lung parenchyma, creating fibrous cysts; In addition, flukes also cause disease in other internal organs, causing inflammation, abscesses, and granulomas.\n3. Biological life cycle:\nPatients excrete lung fluke eggs through sputum (when coughing) or in stool.; Encountering a water environment, the eggs are \"activated\" and hatch into hairy larvae; The hairy larvae burrow into the snail and continue through several stages of development into tail larvae.; When the time comes, the tail larvae leave the snail, swim freely in the water and invade freshwater shrimp and crabs. After that, the larvae lose their tails and form cystic larvae deep in the meat and viscera of infected shrimp and crabs.; People or animals (dogs, pigs, cats...) eat shrimp or crab infected with larvae but have not cooked them, especially grilled, undercooked crab, raw salad... then the larvae burrow into the stomach and intestines, passing through the body. diaphragm and pleura to enter the bronchus to nest. This is why Paragonimus spp. called lung fluke.; After about 5-6 weeks of parasitism in the human body, the larvae develop into adult lung flukes and lay eggs to be released into the outside environment. Flukes can survive up to 20 years in human lungs. Animals such as dogs, pigs, cats... can also be infected.\nSee more: Where are liver flukes parasitic? Structural features, how to move?\n\nSymptoms of lung fluke disease\nIn the early stages of the disease, people infected with lung fluke have no symptoms. About 4 weeks later, the patient begins to have symptoms. Depending on the location of the parasitic worm, the symptoms will be different, including: fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, itching, and rash. (2); During the stage when the worms move from the abdomen to the chest, the patient has symptoms: cough, chest pain, difficulty breathing. If the patient is not treated promptly, lung flukes will cause chronic disease, lasting for many years. At that time, the patient coughed up blood and had phlegm mixed with blood; In addition, people infected with lung flukes may also have bloody diarrhea, swelling or tumors on the skin of the abdomen and legs. Up to 25% of patients hospitalized with lung flukes have sequelae to the brain, with symptoms such as fever, convulsions, double vision, vomiting, and headaches.\n\nCause of lung fluke disease\nIf humans or animals (pigs, dogs, cats...) eat shrimp or crabs infected with lung fluke larvae but are not cooked or undercooked, made rare, salad... the larvae will enter the body. When entering the stomach and intestines, lung fluke larvae escape from the cyst in the duodenum and continue through the wall of the digestive tract into the abdomen.; Not stopping, the larvae continue to penetrate the diaphragm and pleura to enter the lung parenchyma to nest. In addition to the lung parenchyma, tapeworm larvae can also \"settle\" in the heart, liver, kidneys, under the skin, intestines, brain, peritoneum...\n\nHow is lung fluke transmitted?\nLung flukes lay eggs. Eggs come out of the sputum or the person swallows the sputum, then the eggs enter the digestive tract and come out in the stool. The eggs fall into the water and only 16 - 60 days later, the eggs hatch into miracidium larvae. The hair larvae penetrate the snail to develop into tail larvae (cercaria). (3); After 9 - 13 weeks inside the snail's body, the tail larvae leave the snail and swim freely in fresh water to find shrimp, crabs... to parasitize. People who eat undercooked shrimp and crab will be infected with lung fluke larvae. The larvae burrow into the stomach and intestines to nest in the lungs.\n\nComplications may occur\nIn the lungs: Paragonimus spp. nests in the lungs, so symptoms and complications are more common in the lungs. In the early stages of the disease, patients often have localized necrosis of the lung parenchyma, then fibrocystic cysts appear surrounding the adult flukes. By 7-8 weeks after infection, the lung fluke is completely mature and begins to lay eggs in the cyst. This cyst grows rapidly and can rupture in the bronchiole.; In other organs: if the larvae in the duodenum do not move to the lungs but wander to other internal organs, they will still develop into young tapeworms and can create cysts and lay eggs in locations outside the lungs, causing inflammation. abscess, granuloma.\n\nRisk factors that increase the likelihood of being infected with lung fluke eggs\nPeople living in environments where lung flukes circulate; People like to eat salads, undercooked, and undercooked snails, shrimp, crabs, etc.\n\nMethod for diagnosing lung fluke egg infection\nLung fluke disease is easily confused with other lung diseases such as tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, lung cancer...; Diagnosis is based on disease symptoms such as coughing up blood and/or pleural effusion but with little or no fever in the afternoon like tuberculosis. The disease progresses chronically, sometimes falling into an acute phase.; Diagnosis is based on tests and imaging: finding tapeworm eggs in sputum or pleural fluid when the patient coughs or in stool is the gold standard for detecting the disease. However, the rate of finding tapeworm eggs will be lower than 40% and samples need to be taken within 24 hours when the patient coughs and passes stool.; In addition, patients are also tested using the Elisa method, testing pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid... to find the risk of lung fluke infection.\n\nHow to treat lung flukes\n1. Treatment with medication\nDrug name How to use Side effects Contraindications Praziquantel 75 mg/kg/day, the drug is divided into 3 times per day and taken for 2 days. Praziquantel is the first choice for use compared to the remaining drugs. Side effects of drugs to treat lung flukes in general: dizziness, headache, drowsiness, nausea, lower stomach discomfort, rash, itching, possibly fever. Note: + Drink when full, divided into 3 times a day, at least 4-6 hours apart. + After taking, rest in place for at least 24 hours. + Do not drink alcohol or stimulants while being treated as this will reduce the effectiveness of the medicine. + First 3 months of pregnancy. + Pregnant women should not breastfeed within 72 hours of taking the medicine. + People with liver failure, kidney failure, acute infections, mental disorders. + Allergy to drugs. Triclabendazole 10 mg/kg, divided into 2 times, each time 6 - 8 hours apart.\n2. Treatment of sequelae\nDepending on the complications at the site of the fluke attack in the lungs (pleural effusion, cysts...) or damage to other parts leading to abscesses, granulomas..., the doctor will intervene surgically to treat it. decisively.\n\nPreventive measures to prevent lung flukes\nFor patients with lung flukes, voluntarily prevent the disease from spreading to the outside environment. Spitting needs to be collected and processed in a clean toilet.\nNeed to cook food well, drink boiled water, do not eat salads or dishes made from fresh seafood such as shrimp, crab...\nTesting Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City meets ISO 15189:2012 standards, fully equipped with machinery with the most modern technology, imported genuine from European and American countries. At the same time, with a team of doctors with a full range of specialties (Laboratory, Dermatology, Eyes, Respiratory...), patients will be tested quickly, accurately diagnosed, and treated promptly.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Testing Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, you can make an appointment online through the following ways:\nCall the hotline 0287 102 6789 - 093 180 6858 (HCMC) or 024 3872 3872 - 024 7106 6858 (Hanoi) to register for a private medical appointment with a specialist, through the customer service staff.; Register for a medical appointment with any doctor you trust at the link: https://tamanhhospital.vn/danh-cho-khach-hang/dat-lich-kham/; Send a message on Tam Anh General Hospital Fanpage or Tam Anh General Hospital Urology and Andrology Fanpage; Text message via Zalo OA of Tam Anh General Hospital.\nLung fluke is a parasitic disease caused by eating raw, undercooked seafood.
