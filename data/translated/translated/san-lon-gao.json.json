    "content": "Hydatid disease: Causes, symptoms, treatment and prevention\n\nRice cysticercosis occurs when eating raw, undercooked pork containing pork tapeworm larval cysts, which have an outer shell that resembles a grain of rice. So what is rice worm disease, what causes rice worm disease?\n\nWhat is rice fluke?\nRice tapeworm (also known as pork tapeworm, pork tapeworm) has the scientific name Taenia Solium. People get sick from eating raw or undercooked pork. The disease appears in many parts of the world, especially in Vietnam, rice cysticercosis has been recorded in all provinces and cities.\n\nCause of rice tapeworm disease\nHumans eat pieces of pork (raw salad, spring rolls, rice pudding, undercooked meat) containing Cysticercus cellulosae larvae. (first)\nWhen entering the human body, they are released through the intestinal wall and into the blood to travel throughout the body. At this time, there are 2 situations happening:\nSituation 1: If they go to the tissues, muscles under the skin, or tongue, after 9-10 weeks, they become larval cysts (called pig rice). After 1 year, this larval cyst dies and calcify, no longer capable of causing infection; Situation 2: If they reach the stomach, the small intestine will take advantage of digestive enzymes to release, the bright head protrudes, sticks to the intestinal mucosa to develop into an adult fluke in just  2 months. They parasitize mainly in the body's jejunum - where there are many nutrients to feed rice tapeworms. Every day, 4-5 old tapeworm segments containing tapeworm eggs will fall out and be excreted in the stool, even coming out of the anus on their own.\nIf people defecate indiscriminately, tapeworm eggs are spread by the wind, the water of rivers, streams, ponds, lakes... scattered everywhere, sticking to food, drinking water sources, fields and gardens... At this time, if people are unlucky Swallowing tapeworm larvae or pigs swallowing eggs or burning tapeworms... the life cycle of rice tapeworms is repeated.\n\nHow long does it take to get infected by eating pork rice fluke?\nAfter 24 - 72 hours of eating raw, undercooked meat or food or water contaminated with tapeworm eggs, the larvae pass through the stomach to the small intestine, attacking the circulatory system throughout the body.; During the next 2 months, they reside in the connective tissue between muscles and the larvae form cysts with an outer shell with a length of 17-20 mm and a width of 7-10 mm, popularly known as \"pig rice\". or “rice pig” (cysticercus cellulosae). Inside the cyst there is white fluid with a tapeworm head. Under the effect of duodenal fluid, the tapeworm head escapes from the cyst and attaches to the intestinal mucosa, developing into an adult tapeworm.; 67-72 days later, the adult fluke has old segments to push out of the anus, forming new fluke cycles.; Adult flukes can live up to 25 years.\n\nSymptoms and signs of rice tapeworm infection\nPeople with rice tapeworm often have no symptoms or mild symptoms such as: sometimes abdominal pain, intermittent diarrhea, pain spreading to the appendix due to the tapeworm moving from the small intestine to the large intestine, nausea, headache, weight loss. , some cases of seizures, cardiovascular disorders, increased intracranial pressure.\n\nComplications of rice fluke\nComplications can still occur when infected with rice tapeworm. For example, children or people with mental illness may have seizures, mood changes, and cardiovascular disorders.; Flukes attacking the eyes can cause increased intraocular pressure, decreased vision, and blindness.\n\nRisk factors increase the risk of disease\nPigs are raised indiscriminately and pig manure is not treated; Eat pork blood pudding, eat pork, pork liver that has not been cooked like fermented pork roll, pork liver, etc.; Slaughterhouses that do not ensure food safety use sick pigs for processing and then bring them to market.; In rural areas, there is a lack of toilets and open defecation.\n\nAt what temperature does rice fluke die?\nIf you cook pork at a temperature of 75 degrees Celsius for 5 minutes or at a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius for more than 2 minutes, the larvae or rice tapeworms will die.; However, it is best to destroy pork immediately and not risk processing.\n\nMethods of diagnosing rice tapeworm disease\nBecause rice tapeworm disease often has no symptoms or unclear symptoms, it is easy to confuse it with some other diseases and the first thing to do is rule out bacterial, viral, parasitic, fungal infections... In particular, patients infected with rice tapeworm larvae in the nervous system are easily confused with encephalitis or meningitis caused by amoeba or bacteria; Craniopharyngioma, medulloblastoma; Tuberculosis meningitis, astrocytoma in the central nervous system...\nTo diagnose the disease, a stool test for eggs, a CT scan, and possibly an MRI scan or serum test are needed when the patient has symptoms in the central nervous system.\n\nHow to treat rice tapeworm infection in humans\nIn case of intestinal infection (without neurofibromatosis): the doctor prescribes praziquantel or niclosamide. Specifically, when having an intestinal infection, the patient is given 5-10 mg/kg of body weight with praziquantel, a single dose to kill adult worms from the body.\nHowever, for patients with neurocysticercosis (whether symptomatic or not), be cautious when using praziquantel, because when eliminating hydatid cysts, praziquantel can cause an inflammatory reaction related to seizures or other complications. other symptoms. As for niclosamide, the doctor prescribed 4 tablets (500 mg each) to be chewed once, but for children, only use 50 mg/kg (maximum 2 g) once.\nFor patients with nervous system manifestations: treatment is very complicated, doctors prescribe anticonvulsants, corticosteroids, sometimes with albendazole or praziquantel; Maybe even surgery. Corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation and reduce increased intracranial pressure. In addition, people with seizures can take regular epilepsy medications.\nIn cases where the patient has increased intracranial pressure or there are tapeworm larvae in the brain, surgical intervention can be performed.\n\nMeasures to prevent pork tapeworm infection in humans\nIn addition to the authorities strengthening inspection and ensuring the safety of pork from slaughterhouses to the market, each individual person should also equip themselves with food safety knowledge, especially self-employed households. pig slaughter.; When buying pork, people should check whether the meat has \"rice pig\" or not, because this is the cyst of the pork tapeworm. Specifically, when using a sharp knife to cut a piece of pork across the butt or back, if you see white spots like rice grains sticking out on the cut surface, it means the pig is infected with rice pig.; Do not eat pork blood pudding, pork and pork products need to be cooked above 70 degrees Celsius. Note, even when freezing and cooking, make sure to cook thoroughly, especially in the thickest parts of the meat. ; Do not use a knife to cut raw pork and then cut other foods and cooked pork.; Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and clean water before eating; A family with someone suffering from cysticercosis needs to be treated completely and the remaining people should be examined because their eating habits will be the same.\nTam Anh General Hospital Testing Center in Ho Chi Minh City meets ISO 15189:2012 standards, is invested in genuine machinery, biological products, and testing chemicals imported from European and American countries, ensuring parasitic testing. Insects such as roundworms, tapeworms, gnathostomies, trichinosis... accurately and quickly for timely treatment.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Testing Center of Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, you can make an appointment online through the following ways:\nCall the hotline 0287 102 6789 - 093 180 6858 (HCMC) or 024 3872 3872 - 024 7106 6858 (Hanoi) to register for a private medical appointment with a specialist, through the customer service staff.; Register for a medical appointment with any doctor you trust at the link: https://tamanhhospital.vn/danh-cho-khach-hang/dat-lich-kham/; Send a message on Tam Anh General Hospital Fanpage or Tam Anh General Hospital Urology and Andrology Fanpage; Text message via Zalo OA of Tam Anh General Hospital.\nHydatid disease occurs when larval cysts or tapeworm segments are swallowed due to eating pork, pork products (nem chua, chao, thanh, salad...) that are undercooked, re-cooked, or using water sources. , green vegetables... infected with pathogens. Therefore, in addition to preventing the causes of disease, people need to have health checks and tests to screen for diseases caused by parasites, including cysticercosis.",
