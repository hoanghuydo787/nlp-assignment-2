    "content": "Keloids: Causes, symptoms and prevention\n\nScars form after a wound on the skin heals. Depending on each person's constitution, scars form in many different forms: flat scars, keloid scars, concave scars, hypertrophic scars. In addition to shape, scars also have 2 colors: white scars, black scars. Keloid scars are rough on the surface of the skin and are red or purple in color due to the body overproducing collagen during the wound healing process, causing excess tissue to protrude from the skin. Keloid scars cause pain and itching. The article below explains the causes, symptoms and prevention of keloid scars so that patients can better understand the mechanism that causes the disease.\n\nWhat are keloid scars?\nKeloid scars are rough raised scars on the skin surface due to the proliferation of fibrous tissue that is too much compared to the wound and causes scarring. Specifically, when the skin is injured, fibrous tissue forms to repair the wound. However, in some people, this fibrous tissue proliferates excessively, forming a hard, shiny mass called a keloid.\nCurrently, about 100 million people in the world have scars due to surgery or trauma, of which 15% of cases have fibrous tissue that progresses excessively into hypertrophic scars or keloid scars. Keloid scars can occur at any age, appear anywhere on the body, but  often occur in body areas such as: Shoulders, earlobes, chest, cheeks, buttocks,...\nKeloid scars on earlobes are usually round and firm; on other parts of the body, they will have a flatter surface. However, on some parts of the body such as: Neck, abdomen, ears,... keloid scars move slightly when touched.\nKeloid scars extend beyond the boundaries of the original wound, invading adjacent normal skin. Although keloid scars are not harmful to health, they make patients feel less confident, especially in the arms, legs, etc.\nFor people who are prone to keloid scars, even a small scratch can lead to keloid scars\n\nSymptoms and signs of keloid scars\nPerennial keloid scars\nKeloid scars tend to grow slowly, spreading over weeks, months, or years. However, in some people, keloid scars can grow rapidly, tripling in size in a few months. Keloid scars come in different sizes, and the patient will feel tender, itchy, or painful as the keloid develops. This symptom usually goes away when the keloid stops growing.\nNewly formed keloid scars\nThe body produces too much collagen during scar formation to repair wounds. In the body, collagen plays a role in maintaining skin elasticity and supporting muscle, bone, and tissue structure.\nKeloid scars usually appear about 3 - 12 months after injury. At first, keloid scars are red, pink or purple but will eventually turn darker than the skin, with the edges darker than the center. These scars appear as shiny, hairless lumps of skin. (first)\n\nCauses of keloid formation\nThere are many common causes of keloid formation such as:\nEar piercing.; Acne or chickenpox (usually on the face, chest, back).; Wounds: punctures, burns, cuts, shaving marks, animal bites, surgeries, procedures, injections.\n\nAre keloid scars harmful?\nAre not. Although keloid scars cause itching, pain, and discomfort, they are not harmful to health.\nKeloid scars are not infectious, nor are they cancerous. If the patient has had one keloid scar, it is likely that there will be other keloid scars. Keloid scars do not fade over time. To reduce the appearance of keloid scars, patients should see a dermatologist for early examination and treatment.\nKeloid scars are not dangerous to health but cause discomfort for the patient\n\nFactors that increase the risk of keloid scars\nMelanin: Is the pigment that gives color to the skin, hair, and eyes. The more melanin the body produces, the darker these parts become. When skin is damaged, the body produces pigment cells (melanocytes), so there is more melanin in the injured area. Therefore, black people have more melanin than other races, so the possibility of keloid scars is higher.; Genetics: About 1/3 of people with keloids have a family member who has had keloids (more common in people of African or Asian descent.); Age (10 - 30 years old): Keloid scars can appear at any time, but the age range from 10 - 30 years old is the stage when keloid scars are easily formed because collagen is more active.; Pregnancy: Hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy increase the risk of keloid formation. (2)\n\nHow to diagnose keloid scars?\nKeloid scars can be easily diagnosed by looking and touching the scar. When keloid scars are too advanced, the doctor will perform a skin biopsy to rule out skin cancer.\nSkin biopsy is a minor surgical procedure, the dermatologist anesthetizes and cuts out the skin lesion and then sends it to the pathology department for examination under a microscope. If the patient has keloid scars, the dermatologist will have a treatment plan appropriate to the patient's skin condition.\n\nDevelopment time of keloid scars\nAfter the skin is injured, keloid scars can form 3 – 12 months or longer. Thickened skin is the first sign of keloids, about 20% of keloids appear one year after injury.\n\nCan keloid scars be cured?\nKeloids are benign (non-cancerous) tumors, however, keloids are difficult to completely treat and often grow back even after surgical removal. If you have ever had keloid scars, you should be careful when there are skin wounds. If surgery is required, you should consult a doctor to prevent keloid scars.\n\nThe treatments\nThere are many methods to treat keloid scars, the doctor will use one or a combination of treatment methods depending on the condition. Frequently used keloid treatment methods include:\nWound care: For new keloid scars, treatment may include compression bandages made from stretchy fabric or other materials. This method is used after surgery to remove keloid scars. To reduce or prevent scarring after surgery, it is necessary to apply pressure on the wound by wearing a compression bandage for 12 - 24 hours a day and lasting 4 - 6 months to be effective. However, when performing this method, the patient feels very uncomfortable; Use corticosteroid cream: Apply prescription corticosteroid cream to help relieve itching.; Injections: If the keloid is small, the doctor will reduce the thickness of the scar by injecting cortisone or other steroids. Patients need monthly injections (up to 6 months) before the scar flattens. However, when injecting corticosteroids, it is easy to cause side effects such as: skin thinning, spider veins, skin color changes (decreased or increased skin pigmentation).; Cryotherapy: Small keloid scars that want to reduce or eliminate them will be frozen with liquid nitrogen. Side effects that occur when using this method include: blistering, pain, loss of skin color (hypopigmentation).; Laser treatment: Large keloid scars are flattened by treatment with multiple pulsed dye laser sessions (4 - 8 weeks between sessions) to reduce itching and fade scars. Your doctor may combine laser therapy with cortisone injections. Possible side effects include: hypo- or hyperpigmentation, blistering, scaling (more common in people with darker skin).; Radiation: Using low-level radiation (Phosphorus 32 or X-rays) helps shrink or reduce scar tissue. However, radiation has side effects that can easily cause skin cancer complications; Surgery: If the above treatment methods do not reduce keloid scars, the doctor will remove them by surgery combined with other methods.\nIf keloid scars are not treated early, there is a risk of spreading to neighboring skin areas\n\nHow to effectively prevent keloid scars\nIf your body is prone to keloid scars or has a family member who has keloid scars, you should be cautious in doing the following to prevent keloid formation: (3)\nDo not have ear piercing or body piercing.; Do not get tattoos or cosmetic procedures (if you want surgery, you need to contact a dermatologist to check your skin before surgery to avoid the risk of keloid scars).; Take care of all wounds immediately (no matter how small) to help the skin heal quickly and reduce the risk of scarring (contact a dermatologist for specific instructions on how to properly care for and bandage wounds). ).\nKeloid scars are not dangerous to health but cause discomfort for the patient. Therefore, when keloid scars appear on the body, patients need to go to a dermatologist for early examination and treatment to avoid keloid scars from spreading and being difficult to treat.",
