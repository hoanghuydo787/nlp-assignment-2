Gallstones are one of the most common gallbladder diseases in tropical countries. It is worth mentioning that gallbladder stones and liver stones do not show clear symptoms, leading to subjectivity in examination and treatment. In most cases, gallstones are discovered accidentally during other medical examinations. Many people are hospitalized due to gallstone disease when the pain lasts for many days, causing high fever and jaundice. At this time, the disease has serious complications, causing the patient to face many serious health risks, even death if biliary tract septic shock is not treated promptly - MSc. Tran Huu Duy shared.\nGallstones are a common gallbladder disease in tropical countries\n\nWhat are gallstones?\nGallstones are stones formed in the gallbladder or bile duct, ranging in size from a grain of sand to a ping pong ball. This is a benign disease, but if not detected and treated promptly, gallstones will cause bile obstruction (possibly in the gallbladder or biliary system inside and outside the liver), leading to many complications. danger.\nThe gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ located on the right side of the abdomen under the ribs, just below the liver. The gallbladder is where bile is stored. When eating, bile will be secreted into the small intestine to digest food. (first)\n\nCauses and factors/risks of gallstone disease\nAccording to Dr. Huu Duy, the cause of gallstones is unknown, but there are factors that favor the formation of gallstones:\nLifestyle: Sedentary people, obese, diet high in fat, cholesterol and low in fiber, rapid weight loss in a short period of time, diabetes,; Risk factors that cannot be changed: Females, pregnant women, people with a family history of gallstones, age 60 or older; Risk factors for using drugs that lower blood cholesterol and drugs with high estrogen concentrations.\nFor people with many risk factors for gallstone disease, the best prevention is to proactively go to the hospital to screen for gallstones (done during a routine general health check) once a year, and at the same time. Pay attention to eating and living to reduce the risk of gallstones - Dr. Huu Duy advised.\n\nSymptoms of gallstone disease\nThe most worrying thing about gallstone disease is that it has no symptoms or vague and unclear symptoms if the stones do not block the gallbladder. Only when the gallbladder is inflamed will there be symptoms such as sudden pain, usually appearing on the right side, just below the ribs, between the shoulder blades or in the right shoulder; nausea, vomiting; jitter; sweat; fatigue, fever over 38 degrees with chills, digestive disorders. Cholecystitis needs to be treated immediately to avoid dangerous complications such as necrotizing cholecystitis, biliary peritonitis, sepsis, and septic shock which can lead to death - Dr. Huu Duy recommends. .\nWhen gallstones cause cholecystitis, they often present with pain in the right lower quadrant\n\nTypes of gallstones\nThere are two types of gallstones: cholesterol stones and pigment stones. Both types have distinct epidemiological and risk factors.\n1. Cholesterol stones\nThis type accounts for 80% of gallstones, and is often associated with obstruction and inflammation. Cholesterol stones are yellow-green in color and are mainly made up of hard cholesterol. Women and obese people, which are associated with bile that is oversaturated with cholesterol, are often susceptible to cholesterol stones.(5)\n2. Pigment stones\nThere are two types of pigment stones: black stones and brown stones.\nBlack pigment stones: Made up of pure calcium bilirubinate or a complex of calcium, copper and mucin glycoprotein. These gallstones often form in states of stasis (eg, parenteral nutrition) or excess unconjugated bilirubin (eg, hemolysis or cirrhosis). Black pigment stones are more likely to remain in the gallbladder.; Black pigment stones: Made up of pure calcium bilirubinate or a complex of calcium, copper and mucin glycoprotein. These gallstones often form in states of stasis (eg, parenteral nutrition) or excess unconjugated bilirubin (eg, hemolysis or cirrhosis). Black pigment stones are more likely to remain in the gallbladder.; Brown pigment stones: Made up of the calcium salt of unconjugated bilirubin with small amounts of cholesterol and protein. These stones are often located in the bile ducts, causing blockage and are often found in areas where bile is infected. Brown pigment stones are common in Asian patients and are rarely seen in patients in the United States.; Brown pigment stones: Made up of the calcium salt of unconjugated bilirubin with small amounts of cholesterol and protein. These stones are often located in the bile ducts, causing blockage and are often found in areas where bile is infected. Brown pigment stones are common in Asian patients and are rarely seen in patients in the United States.\n\nMechanism of gallstone formation\nGallstones form when bile stored in the gallbladder hardens into solid pieces of material. This process requires three conditions:\nFirst condition: Bile must be saturated with cholesterol. This can occur with excess cholesterol with normal amounts of bile salts or normal cholesterol levels with reduced amounts of bile salts. Second condition: Accelerated cholesterol crystal nucleation or rapid transition from liquid to crystal. This occurs when there is an excess of nucleation factors or an absence of nucleation inhibitors. Third condition: Gallbladder hypomotility, a condition in which crystals remain in the gallbladder long enough to form stones; First condition: Bile must be saturated with cholesterol. This can occur with excess cholesterol with normal amounts of bile salts or normal cholesterol levels with reduced amounts of bile salts.; Second condition: Accelerated cholesterol crystal nucleation or rapid transition from liquid to crystal. This occurs when there is an excess of nucleation factors or an absence of nucleation inhibitors.; Third condition: Gallbladder hypomotility, a condition in which crystals remain in the gallbladder long enough to form stones.\n\nComplications of gallstone disease\nNormally gallstones are a benign disease that is not dangerous until it causes complications. Complications of gallstones affect health and can be life-threatening such as cholecystitis, (6) bile duct obstruction; jaundice; sepsis; choleperitoneum and biliary peritonitis; biliary bleeding; Acute pancreatitis due to stones; purulent cholangitis and hepatobiliary abscess; Biliary tract septic shock. These conditions need to be treated immediately, otherwise the consequences can be fatal - Dr. Huu Duy recommends.\n\nHow are gallstones diagnosed?\nThe diagnosis of gallstones will be made by the doctor by examining the patient's health and may request additional tests if gallstones are suspected.(4)\nBlood tests: To check for signs of infection or blockage and rule out other conditions. Ultrasound: Helps doctors observe images inside the patient's body to detect gallstones. CT scan: Allows doctors to see the gallbladder and intra/extrahepatic biliary system to detect stones. Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP): A technique that uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to create images of the liver, gallbladder, biliary tract and pancreas. Cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan): This method helps doctors check whether the gallbladder is contracting correctly. Your doctor will inject a harmless radioactive substance that finds its way to the organ. A technician can then watch the movement of the gallbladder. If gallbladder movement is not normal, gallstones may be present. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): The doctor inserts an endoscope with a camera through the mouth down the first part of the small intestine and into the common bile duct to detect stones. At the same time, ERCP can help remove stones stuck at the end of the common bile duct.

Treatments for gallstones include:\nGallbladder removal: Can be performed by open or laparoscopic surgery. After gallbladder surgery, gallstones can recur within a year. To help prevent this, people with gallstones should be given ursodeoxycholic acid to limit stone formation.; Gallbladder removal: Can be performed by open or laparoscopic surgery.

(2)\n\nFrequently asked questions about gallstone disease\n1. Should you get pregnant if you have gallstones?\nDuring pregnancy, due to the increase in estrogen and progesterone hormones, bile secretion slows down. This increases the risk of gallstones in pregnant women. Therefore, if you have gallstones, you should treat the disease completely before getting pregnant to avoid the disease from getting worse during pregnancy.\n2. What should you do if you have gallstone pain?\nYou can apply hot compresses to reduce gallstone pain, or use pain relievers as prescribed by your doctor.\n\nMeasures to prevent gallstones\nDoctor Huu Duy advised that to prevent gallstones, people should have a healthy diet, including lots of fiber from green vegetables, fruits and cereals; good fats from good food sources like fish oil and olive oil; Avoid eating starch, sugar and unhealthy fats; Exercise regularly at least 30 minutes/day, 5 days/week to prevent diseases that increase risk factors for gallstones; Do not reduce the application of fasting and rapid weight loss measures; Avoiding foods high in saturated fat can help reduce the risk of gallstone formation, such as butter, hard cheeses, cakes and biscuits. In addition, because gallstones form silently and without symptoms, for prevention and early detection, people should have regular health checks to screen for diseases and detect gallstones.\nGastrointestinal Endoscopy & Surgery Center at Tam Anh General Hospital specializes in examining and treating gallstones as well as other digestive diseases. We have a team of leading, skilled, experienced experts and the most modern medical equipment system available today. Coming to Tam Anh for examination, people will have their condition accurately diagnosed by doctors and treated effectively with minimally invasive methods, allowing for quick recovery and shortening hospital stays. Patients also receive better care thanks to professional post-operative services and a system of high-class inpatient rooms when needed.\nGallstone disease is usually easy to treat with surgery, but very severe cases can be life-threatening, especially in people in poor health. Therefore, do not be subjective and need to have regular health check-ups. When you see unusual signs, see a doctor.",
