    "content": "Urinary incontinence: Causes, symptoms, treatment and prevention\n\nUrinary incontinence is an involuntary leakage of urine that can occur in both men and women but is most common in postpartum women and women entering menopause. The disease causes a lot of trouble and discomfort, affecting quality of life. The article below is expertly advised by M.D. Nguyen Thi Thanh Tam, Doctor of Obstetrics and Gynecology Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, providing detailed information about urinary incontinence, helping patients find solutions. effective treatment method, ending the obsession of living with this \"unspeakable disease\".\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence?\nUrinary incontinence, also known as Urinary Incontinence, is the phenomenon of losing bladder control or being unable to control urination. The level of urinary incontinence varies, it can be a little urine leakage when coughing, sneezing, running, jumping, lifting heavy loads... or it can also be sudden uncontrollable urination, causing the patient not to have time to go to the toilet. (first)\nMSc. Nguyen Thi Thanh Tam, Doctor of Obstetrics and Gynecology Center of Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, said that although urinary incontinence often occurs in women over 50 years old, this is not a consequence. inevitable of the aging process. The disease can still occur at any age, especially women after giving birth.\nTherefore, Dr. Thanh Tam recommends that if urinary incontinence affects daily activities and work, patients should see a specialist early for advice and treatment. effective.\n\nHow to classify urinary incontinence?\nUrinary incontinence is classified into many different types based on symptoms and causes, specifically: (2)\nUrinary incontinence is related to intra-abdominal pressure (increased pressure on the bladder) causing the patient to leak urine when coughing, sneezing, choking on laughter, heavy lifting or vigorous physical activity. This phenomenon occurs due to weakened pelvic floor organs (pelvic floor disorder), commonly seen in women after giving birth or after total hysterectomy.; Urgent urination occurs when the patient has a sudden urge to urinate and leaks urine without getting to the toilet in time. This phenomenon is common in older people, sometimes related to urinary tract infections. In some cases, urinary urgency is related to certain neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury.; Urinary incontinence due to a full bladder causes the patient to always be in a state of urine leakage, unable to completely eliminate urine when going to the toilet. This phenomenon is more common in men, especially those with tumors, enlarged prostates, kidney stones, diabetes or using certain medications.; Urinary control dysfunction occurs in patients with physical or mental disabilities, which hinders timely urination. For example, someone with arthritis may have difficulty unbuttoning their pants, or someone with Alzheimer's may have difficulty planning their trip to the bathroom.; Mixed urinary incontinence is a condition in which a patient has more than one type of urinary incontinence, usually a combination of bladder pressure and urinary incontinence.; Transient urinary incontinence is a condition in which a patient leaks a little urine for a short period of time due to a urinary tract infection or is using a new medication. After these causes are eliminated, urinary incontinence will also disappear.; Bedwetting is a phenomenon of urine leakage during sleep, common in children but adults can also suffer from it. Bedwetting is not considered a health problem, however if this phenomenon occurs frequently when a child is over 5 years old, parents should have the child examined early to find the cause.\n\nCauses of urinary incontinence\nDr. Thanh Tam said that urinary incontinence can be caused by daily living habits, physical problems, underlying diseases or medical treatment methods. Therefore, patients need to be thoroughly examined and accurately diagnosed with the cause to control urination.\nCauses of urinary incontinence are divided into the following 3 groups:\nTemporary urinary incontinence\nCertain foods, drinks or medications (such as diuretics) can stimulate the bladder, increasing urine output, such as:\nWine;; Caffeine;; Mineral water with gas;; Artificial sweeteners;; Chocolate;; Chilli;; Foods containing a lot of spicy, sweet or acidic spices... especially citrus fruits;; High dose Vitamin C;; Medicines to treat cardiovascular disease and blood pressure, muscle relaxants, sedatives.\nUsing alcohol, beer, caffeine... is one of the causes that increases stimulation to the bladder, causing the bladder to increase contractions to expel urine.\nUrinary incontinence due to disease\nUrinary incontinence can also be caused by some easily treatable urinary tract diseases such as:\nUrinary tract infection: Infection can irritate the bladder, causing the patient to have a need to urinate more frequently and more suddenly than usual, sometimes causing uncontrolled urination.; Constipation: The rectum is an organ located anatomically near the bladder, these two organs share the same nerve control. When constipated, hard stools stimulate the nerves in the rectum too much, which can affect the bladder, causing the patient to urinate frequently.\nWhen constipated, the rectal and bladder nerves are affected, causing the patient to urinate more often\nUrinary incontinence is due to changes in the body\nUrinary incontinence can also be due to physical problems or changes within the body, such as:\nPregnancy: Hormonal changes and fetal weight in the mother's body can cause the mother to increase pressure on the bladder, leading to urinary incontinence during pregnancy.; Childbirth: Vaginal childbirth (especially assisted birth with tools such as suction birth, forceps birth) damages and weakens the muscles, supporting tissues and nerves of the bladder, causing women to experience prolapse. pot. During prolapse, organs such as the bladder, uterus, rectum or small intestine can be pushed out of their normal position and protrude outside the vagina. This phenomenon is associated with urinary incontinence.; Age: The bladder's muscular system will weaken as you get older, so it cannot hold urine tightly in the bladder, making it easy for urine to leak out.; Menopause: Entering menopause, a woman's body produces less of the female hormone Estrogen - a hormone that helps the lining of the bladder and urethra stay healthy. This deterioration worsens the condition of urinary incontinence.; Hysterectomy: In the female body, the uterus and bladder are supported and supported by the same system of muscles and ligaments. Therefore, if there is any surgery on the uterus such as a hysterectomy, it will damage the pelvic floor muscles, causing urinary incontinence; Prostatic hypertrophy: In men, especially as they age, urinary incontinence is more common due to prostate enlargement - a condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia.; Prostate cancer: Often, urinary incontinence in men is related to untreated prostate cancer, or it can also be a side effect of a certain treatment. ; Urinary stones: Hard, stone-like masses that form inside the bladder can obstruct the normal flow of urine, leading to urine leakage.; Autonomic nervous system disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke, brain tumors or spinal injuries can affect the nerves involved in controlling bladder function, causing urinary incontinence. incontinence.\n\nSubjects at risk of urinary incontinence\nSeveral factors may increase the risk of urinary incontinence, including: (3)\nGender: Women are more likely to experience urinary incontinence than men due to their anatomy, pregnancy, childbirth and menopause. However, men with prostate problems are still at risk of bladder irritation, increasing urinary incontinence; Age: As you get older, the muscular system in the bladder and urethra will gradually lose strength and support, leading to reduced urine storage in the bladder, making urine more likely to leak out.; Overweight status: Weight is one of the factors that increases pressure on the bladder as well as nearby organs, weakening and stimulating the bladder to secrete urine when coughing or sneezing.; Smoking habits: Regular tobacco use can increase the risk of urinary incontinence.; Genetics: If a family member has urinary incontinence, the next generation is more likely to have this condition than other families.\nHaving a medical condition such as neurological disease or diabetes also increases the risk of urinary incontinence.\n\nSymptoms of urinary incontinence\nThe main symptom of urinary incontinence is involuntary leakage (secretion) of urine. When this condition occurs and how much urine is leaked depends on the type of urinary incontinence listed above.\nDoctor Thanh Tam said that most patients feel shy or uncomfortable when sharing their urinary incontinence situation with their doctor. However, if urinary incontinence occurs frequently, affecting the quality of life and work, it is recommended that the patient see a doctor early for consultation and useful advice.\nWhen you notice symptoms of urinary incontinence, patients are encouraged to see a doctor early to receive advice on effective treatment methods.\nUrinary incontinence, if not treated early and effectively, can lead to:\nReduces or limits activities of daily living and work; Negative impact on quality of life, patients have low self-esteem, limitations in relationships.; Increased risk of falls in older adults when they try to rush to the bathroom when the urge to urinate suddenly strikes.; Urinary incontinence can also be a symptom that signals a medical condition or physical change that requires control or treatment intervention.\n\nHow dangerous is urinary incontinence?\nUrinary incontinence, if not examined early and treated effectively, can cause many serious complications, affecting the patient's quality of life, including:\nCauses skin problems: Frequent urination and frequent wet skin can cause rashes, skin infections and increased ulcers.; Urinary tract infections: Urinary incontinence can increase the risk of repeated urinary tract infections.; Affects quality of life and work, causing low self-esteem in personal and social relationships.\n\nMethods of diagnosing urinary incontinence\nWhat to do if you have urinary incontinence is a common concern for patients. Dr. Thanh Tam recommends that when patients notice symptoms of urinary incontinence, they should visit and consult with a specialist to determine the type of urinary incontinence and assess the severity of the problem. (4)\nTo diagnose, the doctor will examine the amount of water consumed daily, the frequency of urination, the amount of water during normal urination and leakage, and many other symptoms that the patient experiences. Conduct an examination and do some simple tests to find the cause. In case there is more than one cause, the doctor may prescribe the patient to perform some necessary paraclinical tests.\nThese paraclinical tests are:\nUrine test to check for infection and detect unusual signs; Record a bladder diary, specifically the amount of water consumed, frequency of urination, amount of urine and number of times of urinary incontinence.; Ultrasound or use of a catheter to check the amount of urine remaining in the bladder.; Bladder pressure test (patient sneezes or coughs forcefully) to observe and evaluate symptoms of urinary incontinence; The doctor examines and evaluates the strength of the pelvic floor muscles.\nIn case more information is needed to provide an accurate and comprehensive diagnosis, the doctor may ask the patient to do the following:\nUrodynamics: Measure bladder and urethral sphincter function, as well as evaluate the pressure of the bladder, urethra and abdomen at rest and during bladder pressure testing.; Cystourethroscopy: Check for abnormalities or lesions in the urethra, bladder neck and bladder.; Pelvic ultrasound: Provides images to help detect abnormalities in this organ.\nThe doctor conducts tests to determine the degree of spasm of the pelvic floor muscles and evaluates the treatment of urinary incontinence with pelvic floor physical therapy.\n\nMethods of treating urinary incontinence\nDr. Thanh Tam said, treatment of urinary incontinence will depend on the type and cause of urinary incontinence. Prioritize natural treatment methods, mainly changing daily lifestyle such as: (4)\nDrink the right amount of water at the right time of day.; Maintain a reasonable weight level.; Eat scientifically, add lots of fiber to avoid constipation; Exercise and sport in moderation; No smoking.\nThe doctor will guide the patient through natural, minimally invasive treatment methods. Only when these methods are not effective should we consider changing or combining other methods.\nBladder training\nBased on the bladder diary records, the doctor will adjust the patient's daily urination schedule. Try to hold off urinating according to the established schedule when irritated. The goal is to prolong the time between trips to the bathroom, helping the bladder to hold more urine.\nExercise your pelvic floor muscles\nThe doctor will instruct the patient how to perform pelvic floor exercises to strengthen this muscle group. This group of exercises is called Kegel exercises, which help tighten and relax muscles to effectively control the flow of urine. Strong pelvic floor muscles also help hold urine better.\nPatients are given priority to be guided through pelvic floor exercises to naturally treat urinary incontinence\nWhen the above treatments are not effective, your doctor may prescribe one or a combination of the following methods:\nDrug treatment\nDoctors prescribe medication to relax bladder muscles and help prevent bladder spasms. At the same time, blocking nerve signals increases urination frequency and urgency.\nUse medical equipment\nPeriurethral filler: A small tampon-like device inserted into the female urethra to reduce urine leakage.\nPlacing a lifting ring in the vagina: A silicone ring is inserted into the vagina to help keep the bladder raised, the bladder neck is less mobile when there is increased pressure on the bladder in daily activities, preventing leakage. urine leakage. This device is used in people with cystocele, uterine prolapse, or urethral hypermobility (often associated with urethral prolapse) leading to urinary incontinence under pressure.\nSurgical treatment\nWhen the above methods are not effective, the doctor may prescribe the patient to undergo surgery to treat urinary incontinence.\nIn women, pregnancy and childbirth can cause pelvic floor muscles to become weak and damaged. The support component below the urethra cannot keep the urethra and bladder in their normal position, leading to postpartum women being susceptible to urinary incontinence during exertion.\nTo improve this condition, the doctor will place an insoluble lifting tape under the middle of the urethra through the vagina, creating a solid support layer, hanging the urethra and bladder back to their normal position.\nSurgical treatment of urinary incontinence is a method indicated after other methods are ineffective\n\nHow to prevent urinary incontinence?\nDr. Thanh Tam shared that urinary incontinence can be completely prevented if risk factors for the disease are eliminated by:\nMaintain a stable and reasonable weight;; Scientific diet, eat lots of fiber to prevent constipation - a cause of urinary incontinence; Stay away from bladder irritants such as alcohol, beer, caffeine and acidic foods; Do not smoke, you should find solutions to quit smoking if you have the habit of smoking.; Consult your doctor for instructions on proper and effective pelvic floor exercises, especially for pregnant and postpartum women.\nCenter for Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tam Anh General Hospital System is invested in building spacious facilities, gathering a team of Obstetrics and Gynecology experts, well-qualified, experienced and equipped pelvic floor experts.
