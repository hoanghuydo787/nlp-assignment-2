    "content": "Viral fever: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment\n\nWeather changes such as changing seasons are favorable conditions for the development of many viruses. This is also the time when viral fever syndrome is likely to occur, especially in children and the elderly.\n\nWhat is viral fever?\nViral fever - also known as viral fever - is an acute fever caused by infection with a virus or virus. A variety of viral infections can cause fever. Some of these diseases cause mild fever; Some other diseases such as dengue fever can cause high fever. (first)\nThere are many types of viruses that cause viral fever; The most common include Enterovirus, Adenovirus or Rhinovirus, etc. Most of the time it takes about 4-5 days for the immune system to fight viruses. However, there are still cases of severe viral fever that require emergency medical assistance.\nViruses that cause viral fever are often active during weather changes\n\nHow is viral fever transmitted?\nThere are many ways that you can get infected with the virus and lead to fever, commonly: (2)\nInhalation: If an infected person coughs/sneezes near you, you can inhale virus-containing droplets from them. This often happens with the flu or common cold.; Ingestion: Food and drinks can also be contaminated with viruses such as norovirus and enterovirus. If you consume such foods, you are also at risk of infection.; Bitten/stinged: You can also get a viral infection if you are bitten/stinged by insects and other animals carrying the virus. Examples of this are rabies or dengue fever.; Blood transfusion: If the blood donor is infected with a virus such as hepatitis B or HIV, there is a high risk of transmitting the disease to the blood recipient.\n\nSubjects susceptible to viral fever\nViral fever can occur at any age, in which high-risk groups include:\nHaving close contact with someone infected with the virus; Being near infected animals or slaughtering them; Traveling or going to an area where there is an \"epidemic\" of viral fever; Having sex without safe measures with an infected person; Babies, young children and the elderly due to weak immune systems\nChildren are susceptible to viral fever\n\nCause of viral fever\nThe cause of viral fever is a viral infection. Fever is the body's way of reacting against the virus.\n\nSymptoms of viral infection\nOnce the virus enters the body, it will take 16 to 48 hours to enter the infectious stage, after which a fever will appear. (3)\nPeople infected with a virus can have a fever ranging from 37.2°C (temperature measured in the armpit) to more than 39°C depending on the underlying virus. In addition, when a viral fever occurs, the patient also has additional symptoms that last for several days such as:\nCough; Sneeze; Chills; Sweat; Dehydration; Headache; Body ache; Tired; Does not taste good; Tonsil pain; Runny nose; Shortness of breath; Sore throat; Dermatitis; Nausea, vomiting; Digestive disorders (most commonly diarrhea); Rash; Facial swelling; Red eyes\nMost viral fevers last 3-4 days; a few last at least 1 day. There are also other fevers such as dengue fever that can last 10 days or more.\nCommon symptoms of viral fever are fever, headache, fatigue, etc.\nMost patients with viral infection syndrome are not in danger. However, if the fever is above 39°C or above 38°C for children, you should see a doctor. Especially if any symptoms such as severe headache, stiff neck, bright eyes, etc. appear along with fever, you need to go to the hospital immediately because these are warning signs of meningitis.\nNote: If the person infected with the virus is also taking immunosuppressive drugs such as steroids, methotrexate or cancer treatment drugs; organ transplant recipients; HIV infection... or signs of mental disorders should be examined immediately.\n\nHow to diagnose viral fever\nBoth viral and bacterial infections have many similar symptoms. So to diagnose viral fever, your doctor may try to rule out a bacterial infection by reviewing your symptoms and medical history, as well as performing blood tests or taking samples such as water. foam or body fluids.\n\nTreatment of viral fever\nViral fever usually does not require treatment. Unlike bacterial infections, antibiotics have no effect on viral infections – unless you get a secondary infection while having a viral fever. (4)\nTreatment of viral fever depends on the underlying cause of the disease, the level of fever and other accompanying symptoms. At milder fever levels, treatments may include:\nUsing over-the-counter medications: Ibuprofen and acetaminophen are non-prescription medications that people with viral fever can use. Aspirin can also help reduce your fever but should not be used by people under 18 years old. Note, in cases of dengue fever, only use acetaminophen to reduce fever.; Warm bath: Helps soothe a feverish body; Drink plenty of water: Supplementing your daily water intake or electrolytes both helps lower body temperature and prevents dehydration due to fever.\nWhat you should not do when you have fever in general and viral fever in particular is applying cold compresses or soaking in cold water to reduce fever. This is the mistake of many people. In fact, when the body temperature is high, exposure to low-temperature water not only has no effect on reducing fever but can also have a negative effect on the body. Instead, it is better for the patient to take a warm bath.\nPeople with viral fever should spend more time resting and drinking more water\n\nComplications of viral fever\nIf a viral infection leads to fever, is there a risk of complications? Although usually the symptoms will subside within 1-2 weeks. However, there are still cases of viral infections that cause serious complications such as: dehydration, hallucinations/delirium, coma, seizures, kidney failure, liver failure, respiratory fever or multi-organ failure. , sepsis.\n\nHow to prevent viral fever\nBecause viruses are often spread through the respiratory tract, insect bites/bites, body fluids and food, applying the 6 prevention methods below will help you effectively reduce the risk of infection: (5)\nWash your hands properly: Regularly wash your hands with soap/dry hand sanitizer before eating, after coming home from outside, after going to the toilet, etc. Hands come into contact with many surfaces that can contain viruses. Keeping your hands clean helps significantly prevent viruses, thereby preventing viral fever.; Avoid being close/contacting sick people: You should maintain a safe distance from people with viral fever - especially children and the elderly.; Prevent mosquito bites: Some viral fevers such as dengue fever are spread through mosquito bites. Therefore, anti-mosquito products such as creams, mosquito nets, sprays, etc. are necessary items. In addition, you should also close the door at night and ensure the surrounding living space is airy, cover water containers, etc. to not create a breeding ground for mosquitoes.; Cover your nose and mouth: Wearing a mask is a simple but effective way to prevent virus-containing droplets in the air. If you don't have a mask, you should cover your mouth and nose every time you're near someone who is coughing or sneezing.; Have good eating habits: Eating warm food also helps reduce the risk of viral infection because viruses cannot survive at high temperatures. In addition, eating nutritious and healthy foods will help strengthen the immune system against viral infections.; Vaccination: Many infections that cause viral fever can be prevented by vaccination. For example, flu. So if possible, get vaccinated with available flu vaccines.\nViral fever is a disease that can occur at many ages. Most viral fevers are not dangerous, but careful monitoring is needed if the body temperature rises above 39°C. When sick, patients should take time to rest and drink enough water; Avoid letting your body weaken. In the current situation of influenza A epidemic, annual flu vaccination is one of the ways to prevent viral infection that should not be overlooked.",
