    "content": "Genital warts in women: Causes, symptoms, treatment and prevention\n\nUnlike men, genital warts in women are difficult to detect and treat because the structure of the female genitalia is more complex. However, if not detected early and treated properly, genital warts in women can cause serious complications.\n\nWhat are genital warts in women?\nGenital warts in women, also known as genital warts, are a disease caused by the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Currently, there are more than 100 different strains of HPV virus, of which HPV-6 and HPV-11 are the virus strains that directly cause genital warts in women. HPV that causes genital warts and HPV that causes cervical cancer are different types of HPV. (first)\nThe typical sign of the disease is the appearance of papules or pimples in clusters shaped like chicken combs or cauliflower on the female genitals, and can even appear on the mouth and tongue.\nUnlike men, female genital warts are more difficult to recognize because the structure of female genitals such as the vagina, clitoris... deep inside is extremely complex. The disease not only affects husband and wife sex and happy family life, but can also negatively impact women's health.\nTherefore, Associate Professor, Dr. Nguyen Duc Hinh, Director of the Center for Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, recommends that women need to pay special attention to taking care of their bodies and private areas, detecting early signs to receive timely and effective treatment intervention.\n\nWhat causes genital warts in women?\nGenital warts in women are the result of infection with the HPV virus - a sexually transmitted infection (STI). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HPV is a common cause of sexually transmitted infections in the United States, affecting approximately 79 million people, primarily those under 30 years of age. About 14 million new HPV infections are detected each year. (2)\nDoctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that genital warts in women can be transmitted through many different ways, specifically:\n1. Infection through sexual contact\nThis is the most common way of transmitting genital warts in women. HPV can be transmitted during unprotected sex, and can even be transmitted when the penis in men does not penetrate deep into the vagina in women.\nWomen can get genital warts if they have skin-to-skin contact, or have oral or anal sex with an infected husband/partner.\nGenital warts in women are transmitted mainly through unsafe sex\n2. Infection from mother to child\nPregnant women with genital warts need to be actively treated before giving birth, because this virus can enter the newborn's respiratory tract from the mother's genital tract, causing death. Genital warts can cause pregnant women to face the risk of cancer of the cervix, vagina, vulva, and anus; life-threatening bleeding that is difficult to control; risk of cesarean section; risk of transmitting disease from mother to child during childbirth. Therefore, it is very important to treat pregnant women before giving birth to help pregnant women avoid these dangers.\nPregnant mothers with genital warts can transmit the disease to their babies during vaginal birth. In addition, after birth, if the baby comes into contact with rough spots on the mother's body, there is also a risk of transmitting the disease to the body. Infants infected with HPV from their mothers can be fatal.\n3. Infection through open wounds\nWhen having skin-to-skin contact with someone who has genital warts and unfortunately has an open wound, it is likely that women will be infected. Mucus, pus and blood will be the causative agents, transmitting the virus directly from sick people to non-sick people.\n4. Infection due to using shared utensils\nWomen have the habit of sharing each other's belongings such as clothes, towels, shoes... without knowing that there is a risk of infection if the other person gets sick.\nDoctor Nguyen Duc Hinh added that genital warts are different from warts that appear on the hands, feet or other parts of the body. However, women can still get genital warts if they touch warts in other places with their hands and then touch their private areas.\n\nSymptoms of genital warts in women\nBecause the structure of women's genital organs is more complex than men's, plus the long incubation period, genital warts in women are more difficult to recognize. Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that if genital warts in women in particular and gynecological diseases in general are detected early and intervened promptly, the treatment effectiveness is much higher than if detected late and treated promptly. delay card.\nTherefore, women need to be equipped with knowledge about the early signs of genital warts in women to quickly recognize, treat effectively, and minimize the risk of transmitting the disease to their husbands/partners.\nThe signs are:\nWarts or wart-shaped nodules appear on the labia majora or labia minora of the vagina, cervix, anus or groin area. In the case of a couple having oral sex, warts can appear in the oral cavity, tongue, throat...;; In the early stages, warts are small, soft, and feel rough to the touch. When more severe, the wart spreads into a large patch, shaped like a cauliflower;; In the case of genital warts in the anus, women may experience symptoms of difficulty urinating, burning urination or bloody urine. Difficulty defecating, bloody stools;; Most warts do not cause itching or pain, however when having sex, exposed warts can easily break and cause bleeding, which can lead to infection.\nEarly signs of genital warts in women are the appearance of genital warts in the genitals or in the mouth, throat, anus...\n\nStages of development of genital warts in women\nDoctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that based on the development and spread of warts, genital warts in women are divided into 5 stages as follows:\n1. Incubation period\nThe incubation period is calculated from the time the HPV virus enters the body and causes the first warts to appear. The incubation period will be different for each person, it can be 2 months or it can last longer than about 9 months, usually about 3 months.\nAt this stage, the symptoms are not clear and have not progressed into disease, so it is difficult for women to recognize and treat.\n2. Onset phase\nIt can be understood that this is the first stage of the disease. At this time, women may see genital warts appear on the lips or inside the vagina, anus or rough spots in the cervix.\n3. Development stage\nThis is the stage when the disease becomes more severe, the symptoms are more obvious with genital warts that are large, dense, shaped like a chicken's comb or a cauliflower.\n4. Stage of complications\nThis can be called the final stage of the disease. At this time, the risk of infection and ulceration can occur because the genital warts rupture, causing bleeding, pus, and a foul odor. If not treated promptly and effectively, the female genital organs are at high risk of infection, leading to dangerous complications such as vaginitis, cervicitis...\n5. Recurrence stage\nAfter treatment, women are still at risk of getting genital warts again if their husband/partner is still infected or the woman still has the disease-causing virus in her body and has not been thoroughly treated. However, special attention should be paid because if genital warts in women recur, the course will be more severe and dangerous than the first time the disease occurs.\nSee more: Are genital warts in the early stages dangerous? Are they itchy?\n\nHow long is the incubation period for genital warts in women?\nAs shared above, the incubation period for genital warts in women will be different for each person. The incubation period can last as long as 2 months or as long as 9 months, but is usually 3 months.\nDoctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that the reason the incubation period is different is due to each person's physical condition as well as the cause of the disease. If women have poor resistance, the incubation period may be faster than normal. When the virus attacks, after 2-3 weeks, there may be signs of the disease. For people with better resistance, this incubation period will be longer.\nA humid vaginal environment creates favorable conditions for the HPV virus to multiply and develop strongly, causing genital warts in women to incubate faster than in men.\n“The incubation period for genital warts in women and men is also completely different. The reason is that the female genital organ, the vagina, is moist, which is an extremely favorable environment for the HPV virus to attack and develop quickly. Therefore, if they have the same disease, the incubation period and symptoms will appear earlier in women than in men,\" Dr. Nguyen Duc Hinh added.\n\nDo genital warts in women cause pain?\nSurely when you get sick, you will experience some unpleasant symptoms caused by the disease. First of all, the symptoms of itching and burning pain make it difficult for women to carry out daily activities and cause self-consciousness in daily communication. If left untreated for a long time, the disease can affect the quality of life as well as the quality of work.\nTherefore, Dr. Nguyen Duc Hinh recommends that women should not be afraid, go immediately to the hospital for examination, and frankly present to the doctor for advice and find a suitable treatment method.\n\nAre genital warts in women dangerous?\nGenital warts in women are one of the dangerous diseases because of their ability to transmit quickly, making women feel pain, guilt, low self-esteem... If not detected early and treated promptly, the disease can Severe progression causes many serious complications, affecting women's health and fertility. Detail:\n1. Risk of cervical cancer\nThere are more than 100 different strains of HPV that can cause genital warts, but not all are cancerous. However, if women are infected with many strains of HPV at the same time, at least 14 types, they are at risk of causing cervical cancer. (3)\nStatistics show that about 10.2% of women with genital warts in the cervix, 5% of genital warts in the vagina and 5% of genital warts in the anus can develop into cancer.\nIn addition, women are also at risk of nasopharyngeal cancer, throat cancer... if they contract genital warts due to unsafe oral sex.\n2. Affects fertility\nIf your husband/partner has genital warts, there is a high risk of penis deformity causing urethral blockage, vas deferens blockage... affecting the ability to ejaculate in men.\nSome studies also show that HPV virus in semen can reduce sperm mobility, making it difficult for sperm to move deep into the uterus to meet the egg. In case sperm containing HPV meets the egg and fertilizes it, it also increases the risk of miscarriage.\nFear and low self-esteem when infected with the disease cause women to not seek medical attention, easily encountering many dangerous complications to their health and fertility.\n3. Effects on pregnancy\nDuring pregnancy, hormone levels in a woman's body increase, causing warts to get larger, spread more widely, and easily rub against each other, causing them to break and bleed. Genital warts not only make it difficult to urinate, but also reduce the elasticity of vaginal tissue, affecting the natural birth process, making it difficult for pregnant mothers to give birth normally through the vagina.\nChildren born to mothers with genital warts are also at risk of infection. Statistics show that, although rare, about 4/100,000 children infected with the disease after birth are at risk of developing laryngeal papilloma, causing the child to have a hoarse voice, weak cry, etc. If not treated with support, the disease will progress. Severe cases can spread to the trachea and lungs, causing airway obstruction in children.\n\nCan genital warts in women be completely treated?\nWhen diagnosed, most women are confused and worried: \"Can genital warts in women be cured completely?\" Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that currently there is no medicine to treat HPV virus, this virus is still capable of re-infection, meaning women can still relapse after treatment. This means that women can carry the disease for life, may have symptoms or no symptoms, and are at risk of transmitting the disease to their husbands/partners if they have unprotected sex.\nDoctor Nguyen Duc Hinh recommends that when sick, women should not arbitrarily use common wart treatment drugs to treat genital warts. If treated incorrectly, it can lead to more severe and serious injuries. Instead, women should immediately go to a medical facility with a reputable Obstetrics and Gynecology specialty to receive an accurate examination, diagnosis, and guidance on the most appropriate treatment regimen.\nWhen sick, women need to immediately go to a medical facility for examination and guidance on appropriate treatment methods\n\nDiagnosis of genital warts in women\nIn addition to observing the shape of genital warts with the naked eye, the Obstetrician and Gynecologist may prescribe women to perform some other paraclinical tests to increase the accuracy of diagnosis.\nThose checks are:\nBlood test: Some sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia... have a close relationship with genital warts, so doctors may prescribe blood tests to check for women. presence of disease-causing bacteria and viruses; Anal examination: Many cases of genital warts in women do not appear in the genitals or mouth area, but appear deep inside the anus. Therefore, the doctor can examine the anus with a specialized instrument to check for genital warts.; Pelvic examination: The doctor will prescribe a cervical smear (Papsmear test) during a pelvic examination to check for changes in the cervix as well as the presence of cancer cells, screening and prevent cervical cancer.; Biopsy: The doctor may prescribe a biopsy and send tissue samples for evaluation for pathology to evaluate histopathology, HPV virus strain as well as prognosis and cancer risk for the patient.\n\nMethods of treating genital warts in women\nDoctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that current methods of treating genital warts in women mainly remove lesions and cancer risk factors from HPV infection; Minimize unpleasant and annoying symptoms caused by the disease; Control the disease, limit the risk of severe progression causing many other diseases and minimize the risk of reinfection.\n1. Treatment with medication\nSome medications to treat genital warts in women that can be applied directly to the skin include:\nImiquimod (Zyclara, Aldara): Uses to enhance the body's immunity, fighting the development of genital warts. When using topical medication, women should not have sex because it can reduce the quality of condoms and mucous membranes, and more dangerously cause skin irritation to husband/partner.; Trichloroacetic acid (TCA): Uses to burn genital warts, used to treat warts outside the genitals.; Sinecatechin (Veregen): Used to treat genital warts outside or around the anus; Podophyllin and podofilox (Condylox): Use to destroy genital warts, but are not indicated for treatment of genital warts inside the genitals or treatment when women are pregnant.; Interferon or 5-fluorouracin: Used by injection to increase the body's resistance and kill the HPV virus. However, this medicine is only suitable for small, less serious lesions and the cost is relatively high.\nEach type of medicine to treat genital warts in women has certain uses and side effects, women should not use it without a doctor's prescription. It is best for women to go to the hospital for an accurate examination and diagnosis. Depending on the specific condition, the doctor will prescribe appropriate medication, helping to treat effectively and avoid dangerous complications due to the disease. using wrong medicine.\nSee more: 8 completely effective ways to treat genital warts in men and women today\n2. Surgical treatment\nIn case medical treatment is not effective, women will be advised on surgical methods to remove genital warts. Currently, at the Center for Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tam Anh General Hospital System has the following procedures:\nCryotherapy: Using -196 degrees Celsius liquid nitrogen to cause cold burns to the skin around the genital warts. As the skin heals, the lesions will peel off and be replaced with new skin.; Laser treatment: Using high-intensity light beams to treat genital warts, often applied to cases of widespread genital warts that are difficult to treat.; Surgical excision: The patient is given local or general anesthesia to completely remove the damage caused by the genital warts. This method can remove 89-100% of lesions in one surgery, but the risk of recurrence is still high, about 19-29%.\n*These treatments are being performed at Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi\n\nMeasures to prevent recurrence of genital warts in women after treatment\nThe goal of treating genital warts in women is to treat symptoms. HPV virus cannot be completely cured, it still exists in the body so the possibility of recurrence is very high.\nDoctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that after treatment, how long it takes for genital warts to recur depends on the body's resistance, as well as whether women have safe sex or not. Cases with a high likelihood of disease recurrence include:\nPeople with weakened immune systems, chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, tumors or HIV infection. Pregnant mothers who have genital warts during pregnancy also have a weakened immune system, so they are susceptible to recurrence;; People who are undergoing treatment but arbitrarily stop or change treatment methods without a doctor's prescription;; The person has sex without using protection while the husband/partner is in the incubation period and has not yet detected symptoms;; People with gynecological infections such as cervicitis, vaginitis or lesions around the anus create a favorable environment for the HPV virus to develop;; People who use stimulants, or are anxious or stressed also put the disease at risk of recurrence.\nSafe and faithful sex is the leading method to prevent the risk of genital warts in women.\nTherefore, to prevent genital warts from recurring, women need to fully comply with the doctor's treatment regimen. In addition, during treatment, women need to perform additional tests to screen for the risk of other sexually transmitted diseases.\nWomen need to have safe sex, be faithful to only one husband or partner, and not have sex promiscuously. Do not use underwear, towels, or bathtubs together; Clean the genitals every day.\nAfter treatment, although symptoms have decreased, the HPV virus still exists. Therefore, women should keep their private areas clean, use medication and follow the scheduled follow-up visits. If you have sex, you must use condoms to avoid the risk of transmitting diseases to your husband/partner.\n\nThe role of vaccines in preventing HPV infection\nHPV virus is transmitted mainly through sexual contact through direct skin-to-skin contact, oral mucosa, oropharynx or vaginal, uterine, penis, anal contact with an infected person.\nCurrently, there is no method to completely treat HPV virus, only prevention methods. HPV vaccination is considered the most effective solution to prevent sexually transmitted diseases such as genital warts, as well as cervical cancer and genital papillomas caused by HPV.\nThe HPV vaccine is considered an effective solution to prevent sexually transmitted diseases\nAbove is basic information about genital warts in women. Hopefully the above useful information will help women better understand the causes of the disease, early signs of recognition as well as current treatment methods. If you have any questions, you can contact the Tam Anh General Hospital System hotline to receive advice and support from good Obstetrics and Gynecology experts!\nObstetrics and Gynecology Center, Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of good Obstetrics and Gynecology experts, with extensive experience in examining and treating gynecological diseases, ready to advise and accompany women.\nTo schedule an appointment and visit with Obstetrics and Gynecology specialists at Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nGenital warts in women is a difficult disease to talk about, making many women feel self-conscious and shy about not daring to treat it. However, Obstetrics and Gynecology experts recommend that women see a doctor early for advice and guidance on appropriate treatment methods.",

            "subsection_string": "How long is the incubation period for genital warts in women?\nAs shared above, the incubation period for genital warts in women will be different for each person. The incubation period can last as long as 2 months or as long as 9 months, but is usually 3 months.\nDoctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that the reason the incubation period is different is due to each person's physical condition as well as the cause of the disease. If women have poor resistance, the incubation period may be faster than normal. When the virus attacks, after 2-3 weeks, there may be signs of the disease. For people with better resistance, this incubation period will be longer.\nA humid vaginal environment creates favorable conditions for the HPV virus to multiply and develop strongly, causing genital warts in women to incubate faster than in men.\n“The incubation period for genital warts in women and men is also completely different. The reason is that the female genital organ, the vagina, is moist, which is an extremely favorable environment for the HPV virus to attack and develop quickly. Therefore, if they have the same disease, the incubation period and symptoms will appear earlier in women than in men,\" Dr. Nguyen Duc Hinh added."

If not detected early and treated promptly, the disease can Severe progression causes many serious complications, affecting women's health and fertility. Detail:\n1. Risk of cervical cancer\nThere are more than 100 different strains of HPV that can cause genital warts, but not all are cancerous. However, if women are infected with many strains of HPV at the same time, at least 14 types, they are at risk of causing cervical cancer. (3)\nStatistics show that about 10.2% of women with genital warts in the cervix, 5% of genital warts in the vagina and 5% of genital warts in the anus can develop into cancer.\nIn addition, women are also at risk of nasopharyngeal cancer, throat cancer... if they contract genital warts due to unsafe oral sex.\n2. Affects fertility\nIf your husband/partner has genital warts, there is a high risk of penis deformity causing urethral blockage, vas deferens blockage... affecting the ability to ejaculate in men.\nSome studies also show that HPV virus in semen can reduce sperm mobility, making it difficult for sperm to move deep into the uterus to meet the egg. In case sperm containing HPV meets the egg and fertilizes it, it also increases the risk of miscarriage.\nFear and low self-esteem when infected with the disease cause women to not seek medical attention, easily encountering many dangerous complications to their health and fertility.\n3. Effects on pregnancy\nDuring pregnancy, hormone levels in a woman's body increase, causing warts to get larger, spread more widely, and easily rub against each other, causing them to break and bleed. Genital warts not only make it difficult to urinate, but also reduce the elasticity of vaginal tissue, affecting the natural birth process, making it difficult for pregnant mothers to give birth normally through the vagina.\nChildren born to mothers with genital warts are also at risk of infection. Statistics show that, although rare, about 4/100,000 children infected with the disease after birth are at risk of developing laryngeal papilloma, causing the child to have a hoarse voice, weak cry, etc. If not treated with support, the disease will progress. Severe cases can spread to the trachea and lungs, causing airway obstruction in children.",
