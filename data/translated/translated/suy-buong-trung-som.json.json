    "content": "Premature ovarian failure: Causes, signs, diagnosis and prevention\n\nPremature ovarian failure not only impairs sex life but also hinders a woman's reproductive function. This is also one of the leading causes of infertility in women. The article has professional advice from doctor Ngo Dinh Trieu Vy, Reproductive Support Center, Tam Anh General Hospital\n\nWhat is premature ovarian failure?\nPremature ovarian failure is a condition in which the ovaries stop functioning and producing eggs before the age of 40. (1)\nWhen the ovaries stop working, women face problems with their general health as well as their body's reproductive health. When the ovaries stop working, the production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone also stops. These hormones play an important role in the development of female sexual characteristics, regulating menstruation and affecting the conception process.\nMSc. Giang Huynh Nhu, Director of the Reproductive Support Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City shared, \"A case of a young patient only 18 years old came to me for treatment because of premature ovarian failure. This is considered a In cases where puberty has not yet occurred, menopause has occurred. We know there are some cases where babies are born with fewer eggs than normal babies. In addition, a group of women at risk of premature ovarian failure are those with a history of surgery on the ovaries, which reduces the number of eggs and shortens the time a woman has to have children.\n\nSigns of ovarian failure\nAccording to doctor Ngo Dinh Trieu Vy, ovarian failure is one of the causes of infertility in women. Therefore, women should listen to their bodies and recognize early warning signs of ovarian failure so that they can promptly intervene and have treatment. Decreased ovarian reserve has similar signs to menopause such as: (2)\nMenstrual disorders for a long time, irregular menstrual flow, besides the color of menstruation also changes.; Frequent insomnia in the middle of the night, dizziness and nausea; Reduced sexual desire and tendency to avoid sex; Skin shows signs of wrinkles, breasts are flabby and saggy, hair is thin and easily broken; Memory decline.; The vagina is dry, the \"girl\" does not secrete enough lubrication and is painful during sex.\nIn addition, ovarian failure directly affects the production of sex hormones such as estrogen, so it can cause other health problems such as anxiety, dry eyes, thyroid disease, osteoporosis, and heart disease. circuit…\n\nCauses of ovarian dysfunction\nThere are many causes of ovarian failure, which may be related to chromosomal, genetic, or autoimmune diseases. However, a decrease in the hormone estrogen is the main cause of ovarian failure. (3)\nChromosomal changes: The cause of premature ovarian failure can be due to autoimmune disorders, patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and some genetic and chromosomal disorders such as Fragile X syndrome. and Turner syndrome due to viral infection...; Chemotherapy and radiotherapy: This is one of the common causes of ovarian failure. These therapies can damage the genetic material in cells.; Autoimmune disease: This condition occurs when the immune system produces antibodies against ovarian tissue, harming the ovarian follicles and damaging them.; Unknown cause: The cause of primary ovarian failure is often unknown (idiopathic). Your doctor may recommend additional tests and diagnostic methods to find the cause, but in many cases, the cause remains unclear. Besides, toxins from cigarette smoke, chemicals, pesticides... can accelerate the process of ovarian failure.; Excessive weight loss: Excessive weight loss and long-term stress gradually cause autonomic nerve dysfunction, affecting endocrine regulation in the body, leading to decreased ovarian function and decreased hormones. estrogen.; Mental health: Modern women have a lot of exposure to the outside working environment. They are often stressed, tired, and working with long-term intensity can affect and disrupt autonomic nervous function. affects hormonal regulation within the body, causing premature deterioration of ovarian function; Surgery affecting the ovaries or fallopian tubes affects the number of eggs in the ovaries.; Indiscriminate abortion causes damage to the ovaries and disrupts hormones.\n\nIs ovarian failure dangerous?\nPremature ovarian failure greatly affects women's health. This condition leads to the early development of a number of diseases such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and lipid disorders.\nWomen with premature ovarian failure can still have children naturally, but in some cases they need to seek help from modern reproductive support methods such as in vitro fertilization or oocyte donation. In case women with premature ovarian failure want to have children or want to store eggs to preserve future fertility, they need to see a fertility doctor early to get advice on the most appropriate treatment regimen. (4)\nAccording to studies, a woman's ovarian reserve index will gradually decrease with age, especially after the age of 35. However, having children also depends on age factors, for example, a woman with low ovarian reserve but only aged 35 or younger will have a higher chance of having children than those over 40. year old. Currently there is no way to stop the process of ovarian failure or improve this condition. As you get older, the quality and quantity of eggs decrease, so you need to be examined early so as not to miss the golden time in treatment.\nCurrently, egg storage is considered a trend among modern women. Egg storage helps preserve fertility. Stored egg cells will \"stop the biological clock\" right at the time of storage and the rate of usable eggs after defrosting is over 95%.\n\nDiagnostic method\nTo diagnose ovarian failure, doctors will rely on the following criteria:\nWomen under 40 years old; Having an increased FSH concentration above 30-40 IU/L, this limit will also depend on each different laboratory.; Women with irregular menstrual cycles, difficulty in getting pregnant, FSH on day 3 of the cycle above 10-15IU/L and serum Estradiol concentration at the same time ≥ 80pg/L.\nSome tests prescribed by doctors to diagnose premature ovarian failure include:\nFSH concentration test: FSH is the name of a hormone released from the anterior pituitary gland in the brain. For women, FSH stimulates oocyte development, which is part of the menstrual cycle. High FSH often appears in premenopausal, postmenopausal women, and people over the age of 40. In the case of women under 40 years old with high FSH levels above 30-40 IU/L, ovarian failure can be diagnosed. early eggs.; Estradiol test: Estradiol is a form of the hormone estrogen that is produced by the ovaries, breasts and adrenal glands. During the menstrual cycle, FSH stimulates the development of immature ovarian follicles. When the ovum develops, it secretes estradiol. The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are affected, releasing the hormones GnRH and LH to promote ovulation. .; In the case of women with premature ovarian failure, there will be a reduced response or no response to FSH stimulation, so the ovarian follicles do not develop and do not secrete estradiol, and the concentration of the hormone estradiol in the blood is lower than normal.; Chromosomal testing: The doctor may prescribe a chromosomal test to check the cause of ovarian failure.\n\nHow to treat?\nOvarian failure greatly affects women's lives, especially married life, causing patients to lose confidence in themselves. Reproductive function in women is also significantly impaired because eggs cannot be produced and ovulated for fertilization, leading to infertility.\nWomen under 40 years old, if they notice signs such as menstrual abnormalities, delayed menstruation, abnormal menstrual color, irritability, insomnia... should proactively go to a hospital with specialized obstetrics or reproductive support for treatment. be examined promptly.\nCurrently, there is no treatment to improve premature ovarian failure. For women who wish to have children or want to preserve their fertility in the future, ovarian stimulation treatment is applied with the desire to retrieve more eggs than in normal cycles. However, each patient will respond differently to ovarian stimulation drugs, so they need to be examined and have an individualized treatment regimen.\nSome other methods for women who want to become pregnant in the future include cryopreservation of ovarian tissue, oocytes, or embryos... This technique can be applied to preserve fertility, especially for patients before birth. cancer treatment…\nFor women with premature ovarian failure who do not want to become pregnant, they can be treated with birth control pills or hormone therapy.\n\nHow to prevent ovarian function decline\nPremature ovarian failure not only affects reproductive health and the risk of infertility, but in the long term also affects the general and mental health of women. Currently, there is no way to prevent ovarian failure. Women should proactively monitor their reproductive health and get examined if there are signs of menstrual abnormalities such as scanty menstrual bleeding, gradually decreasing menstruation, or missing menstruation for several months. Continuously need to see a doctor and get early treatment.\nIt is necessary to limit stress and constant fatigue and maintain a cheerful and optimistic spirit.; Have a reasonable diet, limit fast and greasy foods and strengthen the immune system, ensuring health to fight disease-causing viruses.; Women should get enough calcium and vitamin D from foods or supplements to help prevent osteoporosis.; Currently, there is no method that can restore ovarian function, so timely examination will help women with ovarian failure be proactive in future treatment plans.\nEgg storage helps preserve fertility for women with premature ovarian failure.\nIVF Tam Anh brings together a team of good doctors and experts with many years of experience in the field of infertility, highly skilled and state-of-the-art equipment that can be performed successfully with many modern techniques. Helps infertile couples fulfill their dream of becoming parents.\nTam Anh General Hospital Fertility Support Center is currently leading the country in IVF success rate. Effective treatment of male and female infertility diseases such as women with polycystic ovaries, people with low ovarian reserve, the elderly with many diseases, have wanted children for many years, failed embryo transfers many times, are prescribed planning to ask for eggs, sperm, surrogacy at previous centers...\nPremature ovarian failure is a dangerous disease, affecting the motherhood of many women. If there are warning signs of premature ovarian function decline, women should go to specialized medical facilities for examination and appropriate treatment plans.",
