    "content": "Acute liver failure: Causes, signs, diagnosis and prevention\n\nAcute liver failure is an uncommon medical condition but can easily lead to many dangerous complications if not detected and treated promptly. The disease can appear with many diverse symptoms, easily recognizable through some unusual changes in the body. Therefore, patients need to be monitored and examined immediately when suspected to receive early treatment to avoid multi-organ dysfunction.\n\nWhat is acute liver failure?\nAcute liver failure (ALF) is a serious liver dysfunction that occurs in people with no previous history of disease in this organ. Acute liver failure is not common, the most common cause is drug poisoning such as Acetaminophen (paracetamol), a commonly used pain reliever and fever reducer. The next cause is viral hepatitis A and B. In addition, viral hepatitis C and E can also cause acute liver failure. However, acute liver failure has a high mortality rate. Therefore, as soon as patients see suspicious signs, they should immediately contact their doctor for early detection and treatment, minimizing dangerous complications.(1)\n\nCauses of acute liver failure\nAcute liver failure comes from many different causes, mainly drugs and viruses. As follows:\n1. Due to viral hepatitis (hepatitis A, B, C, etc.)\nThis is the main cause of acute liver failure. Among them, the most common virus is hepatitis B, often co-infected with hepatitis D. In contrast, hepatitis C is not the main cause. In addition, some other viruses include: Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr, Herpes Simplex, Parvovirus B19, Varicella-zoster, hepatitis A (rare), hepatitis E, viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever...\nAcute liver failure due to hepatitis B virus can cause complications such as: infection, electrolyte deficiency and bleeding, etc. and other complications, if not treated promptly can lead to death.\n2. Medicines and toxins (poisonous mushrooms, industrial chemicals, etc.)\nThe most common toxin causing acute liver failure is Acetaminophen - dose-related toxicity. Acute liver failure is more likely to occur in people with liver damage caused by alcohol or using drugs that induce the Cytochrome P-450 enzyme system. In addition, some other toxins that can be mentioned include:\nAnti-tuberculosis drug: leading is Isoniazid.; Amoxicillin/Clavulanate.; Halothane.; Iron compounds.; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).; Some compounds in Amanita phalloides herbal and mushroom products.\n3. Using the wrong medicine or wrong dosage\nUsing too much Acetaminophen (or Paracetamol) is one of the most common causes of acute liver failure. The condition occurs when the body has to take a very large dose of Paracetamol or after using a higher than recommended dose every day for several days. In this case, seeking prompt medical attention is absolutely necessary to prevent liver failure.\n4. Other diseases\nAutoimmune disease: A disease that causes the body's immune system to attack liver cells, causing inflammation and damage; Metabolic diseases: Rare metabolic diseases such as Wilson's disease, acute fatty liver of pregnancy can also cause acute liver failure.; Cancer: Cancer that starts in the liver or metastasizes here also causes serious damage to the organ.; Shock: Sepsis or shock can severely impair blood flow to the liver, causing liver failure.; Heat stroke: Physical activity in hot environments can also be a risk for acute liver failure.\n\nSymptoms of acute liver failure\nAcute liver failure appears with many diverse symptoms. Some easily recognizable signs include:\nCerebral edema: Cerebral edema can lead to signs of increased endoscopic pressure (hypertension, bradycardia, papilledema...).; Jaundice: This sign is common but not always present.; Ascites: Acute liver failure that appears with abdominal pain is likely to form hepatic vein thrombosis and develop rapidly.; Right lower quadrant pain; Loss of prehepatic opaque area: liver atrophy if due to extensive necrosis of liver cells; Vomiting blood or passing black stools: Caused by upper gastrointestinal bleeding; In severe cases, consciousness disorders may occur: pre-coma confusion and coma\nComplete acute liver failure can develop rapidly even in a healthy person, even becoming life-threatening. Therefore, when the body begins to show suspicious signs or unusual changes in mental state, behavior... the patient should immediately contact a doctor for timely examination and treatment.\n\nDiagnosis of acute liver failure\nCurrently, acute liver failure is accurately diagnosed through a number of testing methods. Specifically includes:\nBlood tests: Blood tests are done to check liver activity, measure blood clotting time (prothrombin time test).; Blood tests: Blood tests are done to check liver activity, measure blood clotting time (prothrombin time test).\nImaging tests: Aim to identify liver damage and the cause of the problem. Additionally, in many cases, your doctor will recommend an abdominal computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to observe the liver and blood vessels. From these tests, some causes of acute liver failure will be determined (Budd-Chiari syndrome, tumors...).; Imaging tests: Aim to identify liver damage and the cause of the problem. Additionally, in many cases, your doctor will recommend an abdominal computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to observe the liver and blood vessels. From these tests, some causes of acute liver failure will be determined (Budd-Chiari syndrome, tumors...).\nIn cases where the cause is unknown, a liver biopsy can be performed through the jugular vein to avoid bleeding.\n\nAre complications of acute liver failure dangerous?\nAcute liver failure, if not detected and treated promptly, will lead to many very dangerous complications. Some typical examples include: (3)\nKidney failure: Kidney failure due to liver failure is also called hepatorenal syndrome; Kidney failure: Kidney failure due to liver failure is also called hepatorenal syndrome.\nSepsis (including aspiration pneumonia and fever): This condition requires treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.; Sepsis (including aspiration pneumonia and fever): This condition requires treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.\nCerebral edema: This is one of the most common causes of death from acute liver failure. When there is cerebral edema, ischemia and herniation will occur, leading to increased intracranial pressure and traumatic brain injury. In particular, bodies with arterial ammonia concentrations higher than 200 micromoles/liter will face the risk of intracranial hypertension. Factors that stimulate cerebral edema include: hypoxia, systemic hypotension, decreased cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and astrocytic swelling.; Cerebral edema: This is one of the most common causes of death from acute liver failure.

Factors that stimulate cerebral edema include: hypoxia, systemic hypotension, decreased cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and astrocytic swelling.\nHepatic encephalopathy: Encephalopathy is also a common complication of acute liver failure, ranging from mild insomnia and restlessness to severe pre-coma and hepatic coma.; Hepatic encephalopathy: Encephalopathy is also a common complication of acute liver failure, ranging from mild insomnia and restlessness to severe pre-coma and hepatic coma.\nBlood clotting disorders and multiple organ failure: This condition can be fatal.; Blood clotting disorders and multiple organ failure: This condition can be fatal.\n\nHow to treat acute liver failure?\nPeople with acute liver failure are often treated in a hospital's intensive care unit, even undergoing a liver transplant if necessary. Most of the time, doctors focus on treating liver damage, but in many cases, this process also includes managing complications and healing. Some popular methods include:\nDrugs to reverse poisoning: Acute liver failure due to Acetaminophen overdose is often treated with the drug Acetylcysteine ​​to reverse poisoning and reduce damage to the liver.; Drugs to reverse poisoning: Acute liver failure due to Acetaminophen overdose is often treated with the drug Acetylcysteine ​​to reverse poisoning and reduce damage to the liver.\nReducing brain pressure due to excess fluid: Preventing brain edema caused by acute liver failure can increase pressure on the brain. Some medications are used in this condition to reduce fluid buildup.; Reducing brain pressure due to excess fluid: Preventing brain edema caused by acute liver failure can increase pressure on the brain. Several medications are used in this condition to reduce fluid buildup.\nLiver transplant: When acute liver failure cannot be reversed, the only treatment available is a liver transplant. During this process, the surgeon will remove and replace the damaged liver. With implants, most patients can return to normal activities within 6 months. However, these individuals require lifelong medical care, including the use of anti-rejection drugs.(4); Liver transplant: When acute liver failure cannot be reversed, the only treatment available is a liver transplant.

If the worst case scenario occurs, the patient will need to use additional medication; Screening for infections: The doctor will take blood and urine samples to test for infections. If the worst case scenario occurs, the patient will need to use additional medication.\nPrevent bleeding: Patients may be given additional medications to reduce the risk of bleeding. In case of excessive blood loss, a blood transfusion will be required and tests will be performed to find the source.; Prevent bleeding: Patients may be given additional medications to reduce the risk of bleeding. In case of excessive blood loss, a blood transfusion will be required and tests will be performed to find the source.\nNutritional supplementation: Treatment of nutritional deficiencies will be performed in cases where the patient cannot eat.; Nutritional supplementation: Treatment of nutritional deficiencies will be performed in cases where the patient cannot eat.\nToday, scientists continue to research new treatments for acute liver failure, especially those that may reduce or delay the need for a liver transplant.\n\nPrevention of acute liver failure\nAcute liver failure is not common, but its complications are extremely dangerous, even leading to multi-organ dysfunction and death. Therefore, early prevention is really necessary and important. Some useful instructions to know include:\nVaccination against hepatitis B virus; Limit alcohol consumption, if any, only drink in moderation.; Maintain a healthy weight and a healthy lifestyle.; Read the instructions carefully when using acetaminophen, especially pay attention to using this medicine in people with chronic liver disease or in people addicted to alcohol.; People with hepatitis B and C viruses need to be monitored, managed and treated; Build a nutritious diet with foods that are good for the liver such as coffee, garlic, berries...\nCenter for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City) and Department of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreatic (Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing High-end, effective examination and treatment services for patients with mild to severe liver problems (fatty liver, acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver failure, chronic liver failure, cancer). liver cancer...). Tam Anh General Hospital system brings together a team of highly specialized and experienced Internal Medicine - Surgery - Gastrointestinal Endoscopy doctors, in addition to the support of a modern medical equipment system imported from abroad. in addition, serving the maximum examination and treatment needs of customers.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of liver diseases with gastroenterology specialists of Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nAbove is a summary of all useful information related to acute liver failure. Hopefully with these updates, patients will better understand their condition and then have appropriate and effective treatment.",
