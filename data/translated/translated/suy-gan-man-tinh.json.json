    "content": "Chronic liver failure: Causes, signs, treatment and prevention\n\nChronic liver failure is a concern for patients as there is a risk of many dangerous complications that directly threaten their health. The condition comes from many different groups of causes, developing symptoms gradually. Therefore, monitoring and early detection for timely treatment is really important to minimize unwanted risks.\n\nWhat is chronic liver failure?\nChronic liver failure is the result of long-term inflammation in the liver. This is often the result of cirrhosis, which occurs when healthy tissue is replaced by scar tissue, causing the range of function to gradually be lost and leading to cirrhosis and liver failure. Specifically, this is an organ that performs many important functions in the body, including:\nProduces blood proteins, which support blood clotting, the immune system and oxygen transport.; Bile production participates in the digestion of food; Helps the body store sugar (glucose) in the form of glycogen.; Protects the body by removing toxic substances in the blood.; Break down the structure of saturated fat and produce cholesterol.\nWhen liver failure occurs, this organ no longer functions normally to perform important tasks. In many cases, this condition is urgent and can be directly life-threatening. However, the liver is a good compensation organ, when the function is less than 25%, liver failure clearly shows.(1)\n\nCauses of chronic liver failure\nChronic liver failure comes from many different causes, some typical ones include:\n1. Consequences of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus\nThis is one of the common causes of chronic liver failure. Specifically, hepatitis B virus will cause the liver to swell if worn in adults, the disease is very silent and difficult to detect. Meanwhile, the virus that causes hepatitis C is often very difficult to detect, and symptoms are not common. In many cases, patients have serious liver damage before the infection is detected. In addition, hepatitis B and C viruses often tend to spread through blood. Therefore, to limit the risk of disease, it is important to not share needles, use unsanitary needles for tattoos or piercings, and do not share razors or toothbrushes.\n2. Drink a lot of alcohol for a long time\nChronic liver failure can be the result of a habit of drinking alcohol continuously for at least 10 years. Specifically, this organ has the ability to self-recover and is responsible for decomposing alcohol that the body consumes. After each filtration, some liver cells will also die and gradually develop new cells. However, if you drink too much alcohol, the organ's ability to regenerate is hindered, leading to serious and permanent damage. In addition, in the long term, toxic chemicals also cause the liver to swell, causing liver failure.\n3. Non-alcoholic fatty liver\nThe liver always contains a small amount of fat. However, fat amounts of more than 5 - 10% will cause fatty liver. This is also one of the causes of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and chronic liver failure, directly related to the following factors: (3)\nMetabolic syndrome.; Fat.; Type 2 diabetes.; Genetic.\nIn addition, in some cases, chronic liver failure can also stem from rarer causes, specifically:\nAutoimmune hepatitis.; Biliary tract disease; Budd-Chiari syndrome, causing hepatic vein obstruction; Effects from cancer treatments, typically chemotherapy; Cirrhosis caused by drugs; Genetic variations, such as Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency; Hemoglobinopathy, which causes iron buildup in the liver and other organs in the body; Wilson's disease, which causes copper buildup in the liver and other tissues in the body; Sometimes there is chronic liver failure for which no cause can be found\n\nSymptoms of chronic liver failure\nChronic liver failure can take months to years to develop noticeable symptoms, unless diagnostic tests are performed early. Some identifying signs include: (2)\nTired body.; Mild fever; Digestive disorders.; Jaundice.; Bleeding under the skin.; Abnormal weight loss.; Edema or fluid accumulation in the legs; Ascites.\n\nDiagnosis method of chronic liver failure\nTo get an accurate conclusion about chronic liver failure, your doctor may perform some of the following diagnostic methods:\nBlood tests: Through blood tests, the doctor will know how well the liver is working; Ultrasound, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), CT scan (computed tomography) can in some cases find the cause; Liver biopsy: In rare cases, the doctor will take a small sample of liver tissue and test it to accurately determine liver failure or related liver diseases.\n\nTreatment of chronic liver failure\nTreatment methods for chronic liver failure will be prescribed by the doctor based on the severity of the disease, damage... Specifically as follows:\nEliminate the cause of the disease\nUse medication as prescribed by your doctor; Surgery: If only part of the liver is damaged, your doctor may recommend removing this part.; Change your diet and lifestyle: Avoid using alcohol and tobacco; Limit eating red meat, eggs, cheese...; losing weight; control blood pressure, diabetes; cut down on daily salt consumption...; Liver transplant: Liver transplant is indicated in cases where chronic liver failure has progressed to a serious stage, requiring complete surgical resection. At this time, the liver will be completely or partially replaced by an organ from a healthy donor.\n\nDangerous complications of chronic liver failure\nChronic liver failure can lead to many dangerous complications, directly threatening health, even affecting life if not diagnosed and treated early, specifically including:\nCerebral edema: Excess fluid buildup is a common complication of liver failure. In addition to the abdomen, this phenomenon can also occur in the brain (cerebral edema) and lead to high blood pressure.; Hemorrhage: due to rupture of varicose veins in the esophagus and stomach; Infection: End-stage chronic liver failure can lead to urinary tract infections, pneumonia...; Kidney failure: Liver failure greatly affects kidney activity, potentially leading to kidney failure.; Affects life\n\nHow to prevent chronic liver failure\nChronic liver failure can be effectively prevented by addressing the underlying causes. Here are some useful solutions that can be applied:\nPreventing viral hepatitis B and C: Preventing viral hepatitis B and C can be done by having safe sex, avoiding sharing needles, tattooing equipment, etc. In case of being diagnosed with these diseases, For this infection, the patient should immediately contact a doctor for timely treatment to prevent unwanted damage.; Preventing viral hepatitis B and C: Preventing viral hepatitis B and C can be done by having safe sex, avoiding sharing needles, tattooing equipment, etc. In case of being diagnosed with these diseases, For this infection, the patient should immediately contact a doctor for timely treatment to prevent unwanted damage.\nAbsolutely avoid alcohol: Although drinking alcohol in moderation may not lead to liver failure, doctors recommend avoiding it completely. The reason is that in the long term, this drink will more or less affect liver function.; Absolutely avoid alcohol: Although drinking alcohol in moderation may not lead to liver failure, doctors recommend avoiding it completely. The reason is that in the long term, this drink will more or less affect liver function.\nPreventing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): This solution aims to treat risk factors including obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol..., thereby limiting the disease; Preventing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): This solution aims to treat risk factors including obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol..., thereby limiting the disease.\nMaintain a regular exercise routine to keep your liver healthy.; Maintain a regular exercise routine to keep your liver healthy.\nBuild a balanced and healthy diet: Daily diet has a direct impact on liver health, some foods and drinks that are beneficial for this organ include: grapefruit, coffee, tea, blueberries, grapes, beetroot juice, cruciferous vegetables, fatty fish, olive oil.; Build a balanced and healthy diet: Daily diet has a direct impact on liver health, some foods and drinks that are beneficial for this organ include: grapefruit, coffee, tea, blueberries, grapes, beetroot juice, cruciferous vegetables, fatty fish, olive oil.\n\nDistinguish between acute liver failure and chronic liver failure\nAcute liver failure occurs quickly and suddenly; liver function can be lost for several weeks or even days. The main cause of this condition is often mushroom poisoning or Acetaminophen (Tylenol) overdose.\nMeanwhile, chronic liver failure develops more slowly, can last several months or even years before showing obvious symptoms. The main cause often comes from cirrhosis, when healthy tissue is replaced by scar tissue.\nDuring chronic liver failure, your liver becomes inflamed. This inflammation causes the formation of scar tissue over time. As the body replaces healthy tissue with scar tissue, your liver gradually loses its typical range of function.\nDepartment of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreas (Tam Anh General Hospital Hanoi) and Center for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Endoscopic Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital Ho Chi Minh City) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing High-class, effective examination and treatment services for patients with mild to severe liver problems (fatty liver, acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer...). Tam Anh General Hospital system brings together a team of highly specialized and experienced Internal Medicine - Surgery - Gastrointestinal Endoscopy doctors, in addition to the support of a modern medical equipment system imported from abroad. in addition, serving the maximum examination and treatment needs of customers.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of liver diseases with gastroenterology specialists of Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nAbove is a summary of all information related to chronic liver failure. Hopefully with these shares, patients will have more useful updates for early detection, monitoring and effective treatment of the disease.",
