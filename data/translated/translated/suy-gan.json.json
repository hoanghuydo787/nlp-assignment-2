    "content": "Liver failure: Causes, signs and prevention\n\nLiver failure is a serious, life-threatening medical condition that requires immediate medical attention. The disease is divided into 3 main groups with different causes, speed of symptom development and level of danger. However, in all cases, monitoring and early detection for timely treatment is extremely important.\n\nWhat is liver failure?\nLiver failure is a condition in which the liver reduces its ability to perform normal liver functions, occurring when most of the liver tissue is damaged and unable to function. This is often the final stage of many liver diseases, occurring when most organs have been irreversibly damaged. But there can also be acute liver failure as in drug poisoning...\nSpecifically, the liver undertakes many important functions in the body, including eliminating toxic substances, fighting infections, producing proteins that help blood clot, and creating bile to help digest food. However, if the liver is infected with a virus or chemical, it can lead to damage, cause liver failure, and even stop working in the long run. The disease progresses in 4 specific stages as follows:\nStage 1 - Inflammation: This is the first stage, the liver is inflamed and may function weaker than normal but does not show obvious symptoms, the patient does not feel discomfort or pain yet.; Stage 1 - Inflammation: This is the first stage, the liver is inflamed and may function weaker than normal but does not show obvious symptoms, the patient does not feel discomfort or pain.\nStage 2 – Fibrosis: Untreated inflammation will leave scars. When scar tissue accumulates in the liver, blood circulation is hindered, affecting the functioning of other organs. At this stage, the liver still has the ability to heal if treated and cared for promptly.; Stage 2 – Fibrosis: Untreated inflammation will leave scars. When scar tissue accumulates in the liver, blood circulation is hindered, affecting the functioning of other organs. At this stage, the liver is still capable of healing if treated and cared for promptly.\nStage 3 – Cirrhosis: Hard scar tissue grows more, gradually replacing healthy tissue. At this stage, the patient begins to notice unusual symptoms due to seriously affected liver function; Stage 3 – Cirrhosis: Hard scar tissue grows more, gradually replacing healthy tissue. At this stage, the patient begins to notice unusual symptoms due to seriously affected liver function.\nStage 4 - End-stage liver failure: At this stage, liver transplant is the only method that can cure the disease, otherwise the risk of death will be very high because liver function has declined to the highest level. At this time, a series of dangerous problems can occur at the same time including internal bleeding, fluid retention in the abdomen, brain edema, loss of kidney function, lung problems... (1); Stage 4 - End-stage liver failure: At this stage, liver transplant is the only method that can cure the disease, otherwise the risk of death will be very high because liver function has declined to the highest level. At this time, a series of dangerous problems can occur at the same time including internal bleeding, fluid retention in the abdomen, brain edema, loss of kidney function, lung problems... (1)\n\nClassification of liver failure\nLiver failure is divided into 2 main groups, including:\n1. Acute liver failure\nAcute liver failure is a serious liver dysfunction that can occur in people with no previous history of liver disease. The main cause is often an overdose of a drug, the most common being Acetaminophen, a common pain reliever and fever reducer. Besides, some other common factors include:\nViral infections: viral hepatitis A, E, viral hepatitis B, viral hepatitis C.; Poisoning; Having certain autoimmune diseases; Genetic.\n2. Chronic liver failure\nChronic liver failure is the result of long-term inflammation that leads to the formation of scar tissue that replaces healthy tissue (fibrosis). The development time is slower than acute liver failure, it can take months or even years before obvious symptoms appear. The main cause of this condition is viral hepatitis B and C, alcohol abuse or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)... causing loss of the typical range of inherent functions.\n\nCauses of liver failure\nAcute and chronic liver failure arise from different causes. As follows:\n1. Causes of acute liver failure\nAcetaminophen overdose causes liver damage.; Acetaminophen overdose causes liver damage.\nViruses including hepatitis A, B, E, Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex virus cause liver damage or cirrhosis.(4); Viruses including hepatitis A, B, E, Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex cause liver damage or cirrhosis.(4)\nReactions to certain prescription drugs or herbs: Some ingredients in prescription drugs or herbs can damage the bile duct system or kill liver cells, causing acute liver failure.; Reactions to certain prescription drugs or herbs: Some ingredients in prescription drugs or herbs can damage the bile duct system or kill liver cells, causing acute liver failure.\nEating poisonous wild mushrooms: A toxin in wild mushrooms called Amanita phalloides has the ability to damage liver cells and lead to liver failure within just a few days.; Eating poisonous wild mushrooms: A toxin in wild mushrooms called Amanita phalloides has the ability to damage liver cells and lead to liver failure within just a few days.\nAutoimmune hepatitis: Similar to viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis is also a common cause of acute liver failure.; Autoimmune hepatitis: Similar to viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis is also a common cause of acute liver failure.\nWilson's disease: This is a genetic disease that prevents the body from eliminating copper, leading to accumulation and damage to the liver.; Wilson's disease: This is a genetic disease that prevents the body from eliminating copper, leading to accumulation and damage to the liver.\nAcute fatty liver in pregnant women: This is a rare condition but can still occur, mainly due to excess fat concentrating in the liver, causing damage.; Acute fatty liver in pregnant women: This is a rare condition but can still occur, mainly due to excess fat concentrating in the liver, causing damage.\nSeptic shock: Septic shock can damage the liver, even causing the liver to stop working; Septic shock: Septic shock can damage the liver, even causing the liver to stop working.\nBudd Chiari Syndrome: This rare disease causes narrowing and blockage of the blood vessels behind the liver.; Budd Chiari syndrome: This rare disease causes narrowing and blockage of the blood vessels behind the liver.\nIndustrial toxins: Toxic industrial chemicals, especially Carbon Tetrachloride, have the risk of harming the liver upon exposure.; Industrial toxins: Toxic industrial chemicals, especially Carbon Tetrachloride, have the risk of harming the liver upon exposure.\n\nCauses of chronic liver failure\nHepatitis B and D: Hepatitis B causes the liver to swell and not function as usual. When hepatitis B virus is present, it can cause co-infection with hepatitis D virus; Hepatitis B and D: Hepatitis B causes the liver to swell and not function as usual. When hepatitis B virus is present, it can cause co-infection with hepatitis D virus.\nHepatitis C: Hepatitis C in the long term will lead to cirrhosis.; Hepatitis C: Hepatitis C in the long term will lead to cirrhosis.\nDrinking alcohol for a long time; Drinking alcohol for a long time.\nHemochromatosis: This is a disorder that causes the body to absorb and accumulate too much iron, causing cirrhosis.(3); Hemochromatosis: This is a disorder that causes the body to absorb and accumulate too much iron, causing cirrhosis.(3)\nSome other reasons\nViral hepatitis A, E.; Autoimmune hepatitis.; Cirrhosis.; Wilson's disease.; Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency.; Liver Cancer.; Liver adenoma.; Fatty liver disease.; Alagille syndrome.; Primary cholangitis (PBC).; Galactosemia.; Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D).\n\nSigns of liver failure\nLiver failure often develops over many years. Symptoms are similar to some other diseases, so it often makes diagnosis difficult in the early stages. In the long term, the signs become more serious as the organ continues to weaken and liver function declines sharply.\nSpecifically, chronic liver failure often occurs over many years with some of the following symptoms:\nTired.; Nausea.; Does not taste good; Diarrhea.; Vomiting blood.; Blood appears in the stool.\nAs liver failure progresses, symptoms become more severe. Some worrying symptoms in the later stages include:\nJaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes).; Tired body.; Disorientation.; Fluid accumulation in the abdomen and extremities (arms and legs).; For acute liver failure, symptoms include:; Bleed.; Sweet or musty odor on the breath (ammonia smell).; Does not taste good; Jaundice.; Tired body.\n\nMethods of diagnosing liver failure\nCurrently, liver failure can be accurately diagnosed through a number of methods as follows:\nLiver function test: This test helps measure the concentration of Albumin, prothrombin and other enzymes in the blood, thereby accurately determining liver function status.(2); Liver function test: This test helps measure the concentration of Albumin, prothrombin and other enzymes in the blood, thereby accurately determining liver function status.(2)\nBlood tests: Your doctor may order a complete blood count or a test for viral hepatitis, a genetic condition that can cause liver damage.; Blood tests: Your doctor may order a complete blood count or a test for viral hepatitis, a genetic condition that can cause liver damage.\nImaging tests: Your doctor may do an ultrasound of the liver, or recommend an abdominal computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound to look for problems happening in the liver. Determine the exact cause to prescribe appropriate treatment methods.; Imaging tests: Your doctor may do an ultrasound of the liver, or recommend an abdominal computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound to look for problems happening in the liver. Determine the exact cause to prescribe appropriate treatment methods.\nLiver biopsy: In necessary cases, with this method, the doctor will take tissue samples from the liver to examine the condition of scar tissue (if any), thereby helping to diagnose the exact cause. ; Liver biopsy: In necessary cases, with this method, the doctor will take tissue samples from the liver to examine the condition of scar tissue (if any), thereby helping to diagnose the exact cause.\n\nComplications of liver failure\n1. Is liver failure dangerous?\nLiver failure is a serious, potentially life-threatening medical condition with dangerous complications as follows:\nCerebral edema: This is one of the most common complications of liver failure, fluid not only accumulates in the abdomen but can also accumulate in the brain, causing brain edema and high blood pressure.; Blood clotting problems: The liver plays an important role in the blood clotting process in the body, so when this organ is damaged, uncontrolled bleeding can easily occur.; Infection: End-stage liver failure can easily cause pneumonia and urinary tract infections; Kidney failure: Liver failure affects the functioning of the kidneys, which can lead to kidney failure.\n2. Is liver failure contagious?\nLiver failure is not contagious, the causes of liver failure due to hepatitis A and E viruses can be transmitted through the gastrointestinal tract: eating and drinking. Hepatitis B and C viruses are transmitted through blood or sexual contact, not through the gastrointestinal tract. At this time, viruses that cause organ damage can spread through blood, semen, food or contact with infected people. In addition, the remaining cases are not infectious.\n\nTreatment of liver failure\nDepending on the stage of liver failure as well as the cause of the disease, the doctor will prescribe appropriate treatment methods, including:\n1. Medicine\nAcetylcysteine ​​is a drug that reverses liver poisoning, used in cases of disease caused by Acetaminophen overdose. In addition, doctors may also prescribe some medications with similar effects for people with liver failure due to other toxins. Treat with specific drugs for hepatitis B and C viruses. Treat other causes of liver failure.\n2. Liver transplant\nIf the liver is seriously damaged and can no longer function to maintain life, a liver transplant is the last resort. During this process, the damaged liver is removed and replaced with a healthy liver from a donor. After transplant, most patients can return to normal activities within 6 months. However, the application of lifelong medical care methods is mandatory to ensure the organ always functions effectively.(5)\n\nHow to prevent liver failure\nThe effective way to prevent liver failure is to focus on preventing the underlying causes. Some useful solutions include:\nMonitor and treat hepatitis B virus when indicated; Monitor and treat hepatitis B virus when indicated.\nPrevent hepatitis C virus infection: Effective prevention of hepatitis C is also a way to limit the risk of liver failure. Some basic solutions include: having safe sex, avoiding sharing needles, tattooing equipment, etc. In case of being diagnosed with hepatitis C virus, the patient should immediately contact a doctor for treatment. Treat promptly to avoid serious damage to organs; Prevent hepatitis C virus infection: Effective prevention of hepatitis C is also a way to limit the risk of liver failure. Some basic solutions include: having safe sex, avoiding sharing needles, tattooing equipment, etc. In case of being diagnosed with hepatitis C virus, the patient should immediately contact a doctor for treatment. Treat promptly to avoid serious damage to organs.\nPreventing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): This is a solution to treat risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity... to minimize liver failure.; Preventing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): This is a solution to treat risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity... to minimize liver failure.\nUse medications and functional foods for the liver as prescribed by your doctor, avoid arbitrarily using them to limit unwanted problems, especially acute liver failure.; Use medications and functional foods for the liver as prescribed by your doctor, avoid arbitrarily using them to limit unwanted problems, especially acute liver failure.\nBuild a liver-friendly diet, including the following foods: oats, green tea, garlic, berries, grapefruit, coffee...; Build a liver-friendly diet, including the following foods: oats, green tea, garlic, berries, grapefruit, coffee...\nBuild a regular exercise routine with appropriate intensity to strengthen your liver and overall health.; Build a regular exercise routine with appropriate intensity to strengthen your liver and overall health.\nLimit alcohol consumption: Although alcohol in moderation is unlikely to lead to liver failure, doctors recommend completely avoiding these stimulants, especially for patients suffering from certain related diseases. liver related; Limit alcohol consumption: Although alcohol in moderation is unlikely to lead to liver failure, doctors recommend completely avoiding these stimulants, especially for patients suffering from certain related diseases. liver related.\nDepartment of Gastroenterology (Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City) and Department of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreatic (Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing high-quality examination and treatment services.
