    "content": "Testosterone deficiency: Causes, signs, treatments\n\nTestosterone is considered the \"power\" hormone of men, it governs all aspects of a man's health, nerves, psychology, and physiological and reproductive abilities. However, over time and many factors cause Testosterone to continuously decline. When male hormones are depleted, men face many unwanted problems. To control and maintain stable hormone levels, men need to clearly understand the causes of testosterone decline, as well as the signs of recognition and effective treatment early on.\n\nWhat is low Testosterone?\nTestosterone deficiency or male hormone deficiency is a condition in which blood testosterone levels are below the average level of 10-35 nanomol/liter in adults. According to the American Urological Association (AUA), about 20% of men over 60 years old have low Testosterone levels, this number increases to 30% of men aged 70-80.\nTestosterone is a sex hormone produced mainly in Leydig cells in the testicles and a small amount of the adrenal gland from the 7th week of pregnancy. It increases during puberty and 20-30 years old in men with low levels of Testosterone. reached its peak. After age 30, the amount of male hormones begins to decline, and becomes evident at age 40. (1)\n\nTestosterone decline with age in men\nOver time, the body's organs gradually deteriorate, so they cannot produce the necessary amount of Testosterone for the body to function normally. It is estimated that Testosterone decreases by an average of 1-2% per year and is only about 70% at age 50 and 50% at age 70. The older you are, the faster the rate of Testosterone decline occurs.\nThe amount of Testosterone in the body often decreases over time\n\nCauses of decreased Testosterone levels\nIn addition to the age factor, after age 30, Testosterone begins to decline naturally, but it is also affected by many of the following hidden factors: (2)\nStress, fatigue: Mental stress, being under a lot of pressure, and frequent insomnia are some of the causes of rapid decline in Testosterone. When stressed, the body releases hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline to help protect the body. However, these hormones inhibit the production of the hormone Testosterone. This explains why when men are stressed, they often lose desire and are no longer interested in sex. One study also showed that people who sleep less than 5 hours per night for 1 week will have Testosterone levels of a person 15 years older.; Sexual abuse: This is a factor leading to testosterone depletion. Excessive sexual activity or masturbation not only causes genital infections such as prostatitis and orchitis, but too much frequency of sex will increase the impact on the nervous organs. , causing the genital organs to be constantly stimulated to operate and ejaculate continuously, the amount of Testosterone in the body is also reduced.; Exposure to toxic chemicals, polluted environment: Toxic chemicals such as dust, pesticides, smoking... not only negatively affect overall health but also affect sexual health of men. Specifically, nicotine and toxic ingredients in cigarettes cause fibrosis, aging of the arteries, blocking blood flow to the penis, causing erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation.\nIn addition, these toxic chemicals also affect Testosterone levels, which is an important component that creates sexual desire, directs the erection process and participates in sperm production. According to documents from the national tobacco control program, it is clear: Smoking reduces sperm production, affecting sperm quality (deformed sperm, poor mobility).\nSide effects of drugs: Some treatment drugs have unwanted effects that reduce the amount of Testosterone in the body such as: sedatives, sleeping pills, drugs to treat stomach ulcers, joints, prostate cancer... is one of the factors that reduce male hormones as well as men's sexual ability.; Suffering from certain diseases: Overweight, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, tendonitis, chronic kidney failure, severe primary hypothyroidism, HIV... are diseases that reduce Testosterone in the body to low levels.\nIn addition, inappropriate lifestyle, diet, and exercise also affect the production of male hormones, leading to low Testosterone, falling below normal levels, causing many serious symptoms for the body. can.\n\nSigns of low Testosterone\nA variety of symptoms can occur if Testosterone production plummets. The following are signs that Testosterone levels are decreasing, which every gentleman should understand.\nLow sexual desire\nTestosterone is a hormone that plays an important role in men's physiological functions such as: creating sexual desire, directing the erection process, and controlling the production and nourishment of sperm. Therefore, when the amount of this hormone decreases, it leads to a decrease in sexual desire, men \"lose fire\", are no longer interested, think less about sex, and even avoid sex.\nMen no longer interested in \"love\" is one of the signs of Testosterone decline\nDifficulty with erection\nTestosterone, in addition to its role in creating a man's sexual desire, also directs and supports achieving and maintaining an erection. Testosterone does not produce an erection, but it stimulates receptors in the brain to produce Nitric Oxide. Nitric oxide is a molecule that helps the muscles on the walls of blood vessels relax, allowing blood to circulate and the erection process to take place easily. Therefore, when this hormone is low, it may be difficult for a man to achieve an erection both during sex and spontaneous erection (during sleep). (3)\nHowever, Testosterone is only one of many factors that help contribute to the erection process, so there are no conclusive studies on the role of Testosterone in treating erectile dysfunction. In fact, erectile dysfunction is a sign of decreased Testosterone, but this can also be a sign of many other diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, high cholesterol, and other health problems. Thyroid disorders, mental diseases such as stress and depression.\nLow semen volume\nTestosterone plays a role in semen production, determining the quantity, quality, shape, and mobility of sperm. Men with low Testosterone will often notice a decrease in their semen volume during ejaculation, resulting in less ejaculation. When the quantity and quality of sperm is low, it will affect men's fertility and infertility is a common problem.\nHair loss\nTestosterone plays a role in a number of body functions, including affecting the ciliary system, helping hair and beard grow densely. Baldness can be a natural part of the aging process for many men. Although there is a genetic component to baldness, men with low Testosterone may also experience loss of overall body and facial hair.\nTired\nMen with low Testosterone make men feel very tired, have less energy, and are no longer energetic and active in all activities. They are always tired and lethargic even though they have had enough sleep and do not even want to exercise.\nMuscle loss\nBecause Testosterone plays a role in muscle building, men with low Testosterone may notice a decrease in muscle mass. Studies have shown that Testosterone affects muscle mass by enlarging muscle fibers, maintaining muscle strength. In addition, this hormone also helps ensure a strong connection between the bone body and the periosteum to develop bone size and length synchronously. At the same time, Testosterone also contributes to the development of bone structure by increasing calcium absorption. Therefore, once male hormone levels are reduced, muscle mass becomes loose and less firm.\nThe decrease in male hormones is the factor that causes the body to lose solid muscle mass\nBody accumulates fat\nMen with low Testosterone lose muscle and are replaced by increased fat. Because Testosterone has the role of inhibiting Leptin cells (a hormone that produces fat cells), keeping men's total body fat and belly fat at a low level. Once the amount of male hormones is low, the male body becomes unbalanced, with a lot of fat accumulating in the abdomen, gynecomastia syndrome, or breast tissue hypertrophy. And this is believed to be due to an imbalance between Testosterone and Estrogen in men.\nReduced bone mass\nReduced bone mass, also known as osteoporosis, is a condition that commonly occurs in women. However, men with low male hormones can also experience bone loss. Testosterone helps produce and strengthen bones. Therefore, men with low Testosterone, especially older men, have low bone density and are more susceptible to bone fractures.\nMood changes\nMen with low androgens may experience changes in mood. Because this is a hormone that plays a role in regulating the nervous and mental systems in the body, it has an impact on mood and mental capacity. Many studies show that men with low Testosterone are more likely to face depression, irritability or lack of concentration. As well as health problems causing diseases such as anemia, sleep disorders, depression...\nForgetful, forgetful\nOver time, men's testosterone and cognitive abilities, especially memory, decline. A study at Monash University (Australia) shows that Testosterone helps protect neurons and brings more oxygen to the brain. However, as we age, Testosterone levels in the brain decrease, causing memory loss.\nSmall testicle size\nLow testosterone levels in the body are also the \"culprit\" that causes the testicles to be smaller than average. Because the body needs Testosterone to develop sexual organs, including the penis and testicles. When Testosterone exists at low levels, it will cause the penis or testicles to be small, even disproportionate. However, small testicles have many other causes.\nAnemia\nTestosterone plays a role in stimulating the bone marrow to create hematopoiesis, increasing red and white blood cells. According to a research article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, doctors link low testosterone with an increased risk of anemia. When researchers administered Testosterone gel to anemic men with low Testosterone, they saw improvements in blood counts compared to men who used a placebo gel. Some symptoms that anemia can cause include difficulty concentrating, cramps, difficulty sleeping, dizziness, and an abnormally fast heart rate.\nIn addition, low Testosterone also causes other diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and thyroid-related diseases.\n\nHow is Low Testosterone Diagnosed?\nTo diagnose low testosterone, in addition to a physical assessment and review of the patient's symptoms, the doctor may order a test to measure the amount of Testosterone in the patient's blood.\nTestosterone tests are performed like regular blood tests and are done in the morning when this hormone is at its highest concentration. Before the test, the doctor will ask the patient to stop taking medications that can affect hormone levels in the blood.\nTestosterone test results show the level of Testosterone concentration. If Testosterone is in the range of 10-35 nanomol/liter, it is a normal healthy level. If the index is lower than this threshold, it will affect the health, physiological and reproductive abilities of men such as: fatigue, reduced sexual interest, difficulty in erecting the penis, infertility...\nThe test measures the amount of Testosterone in the blood\n\nLow Testosterone Treatments\nLow testosterone has a great impact on men's lives, so if this situation occurs, men with low testosterone need to go to a reputable medical facility or hospital for timely examination and intervention. . Depending on the condition, the doctor will prescribe appropriate treatment. Typically, low Testosterone treatment has the following methods: (4)\nTestosterone supplement therapy\nTestosterone replacement therapy applies to people whose symptoms of low Testosterone greatly affect their lives. This method is performed in many ways such as: injection into the upper arm (10-14 days per course); Use Testosterone patches (on body parts such as: abdomen, buttocks, back, arms); Gel on clean, dry skin areas daily on the back and arms; Pills implanted under the arm every 2 months or you can use Testosterone pills.\nMost people will notice a reduction in symptoms within 4–6 weeks of starting this treatment. However, this is a therapy with many potential risks such as: increased risk of sleep apnea, stimulation of hidden prostate cancer cells in the body, enlarged breasts, increased risk of blood clots forming. Deep vein blockage, pulmonary embolism, limited sperm production and testicular shrinkage. In particular, Testosterone therapy also has a high risk of causing cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, when choosing this therapy, you need to discuss carefully with your doctor about the benefits and risks you face to make the right decision.\nUse functional foods\nCurrently, on the market there are many products that support and improve physiological abilities for men. However, when choosing these products, you need to pay attention to the product origin, ingredients, mechanism of action, as well as effectiveness, safety, and the product is licensed for circulation by authorities.\nIncrease Testosterone naturally\nBesides enhancing Testosterone with medicinal treatments and using products of natural origin, increasing Testosterone with natural methods is of interest to many people. Here are some ways to increase Testosterone naturally:\nRegularly exercise: You should spend 30-60 minutes a day to exercise, and need to maintain it 5 times a week.; Positive lifestyle changes: Have a regular work and rest regime, limit and control stress, avoid staying up late, limit alcohol, tobacco...; Have a nutritious diet, increasing foods that are good for male physiology such as seafood, beef, eggs, milk, cereals, and nuts.\nExercises to increase Testosterone\nRegularly practicing sports, in addition to exercising, enhances musculoskeletal flexibility, stimulates blood circulation, and has a toned body. It is also an effective method to improve male hormones. The following are effective exercises to increase Testosterone:\nSwimming; Brisk walking; Yoga; Kegel; Weightlifting; Squat\n\nPreventing Testosterone depletion\nTestosterone hormone is extremely important for men, it is necessary to take preventive measures early in the following ways:\nMinimize stress and control stress: This is considered the leading cause of male hormone decline. Therefore, we need to find ways to eliminate and minimize stress by:\nArrange your work reasonably, don't take on too many tasks at the same time.; Take time to listen to music, read books, meditate, chat with friends or relatives.; Practicing deep breathing helps relieve nervous tension; Exercise is also a way to improve your health and help you feel refreshed; Relax with hobbies such as: playing with birds, pruning ornamental plants...; Avoid staying up late, get enough sleep 7-8 hours a day\nReading is a way to help relax the mind and relieve stress\nBuild a healthy, scientific diet: Nutrition is the factor that directly affects hormones in the body. Men need to eat a nutritious diet, increasing foods rich in vitamins and minerals, especially zinc, Omega-3, vitamins A, B, C, D, E... which are important nutrients to help the body. Produces natural Testosterone in the body. These nutrients are found in many sources of seafood, vegetables, fruits, nuts: salmon, oysters, broccoli, carrots, spinach, tomatoes, watermelon, avocados, apples... At the same time, Eliminating the habit of drinking a lot of alcohol, eating a lot of oil, canned food, fast food, too sweet or salty food... will cause Testosterone in the body to \"decrease\" even faster. A scientific diet also helps men maintain a reasonable weight, preventing overweight and obesity, which are factors that significantly affect men's hormones.\nRegular sexual activity: Excessive sex or masturbation affects men's hormone levels. The question many people ask is, how much sex is enough? American sex experts researched and published in 2012 on how to calculate the number of times of sex using the \"number 9 formula\". This rule is to take the tens number of your age and multiply it by 9. For example, age 20-29 (take the number 2 x 9 = 18) is equivalent to having sex 8 times a week. From 30 to 39 years old, you should have sex 7 times/2 weeks. From 40 to 49 years old, have sex 6 times/3 weeks. From 50 to 59 years old, have sex 5 times/4 weeks. From 60-69 years old, have sex 4 times/5 weeks. Regular sexual activity is a way to improve health and \"protect\" the amount of Testosterone in the body at a normal, stable level.\nHave a healthy living environment: According to experts, synthetic and natural chemicals have been shown to increase the conversion of Testosterone into estrogen, while reducing the receptors that convert Testosterone into Androgen. Therefore, limiting the body's exposure to toxic chemicals, polluted dust, pesticides, cigarette smoke, chemicals... helps men minimize the loss of Testosterone.\nDepartment of Andrology, Tam Anh General Hospital System with a team of experts and doctors who are skilled, dedicated, enthusiastic, and confident in mastering the most advanced techniques with the support of machinery and equipment systems.

Many studies show that men with low Testosterone are more likely to face depression, irritability or lack of concentration. As well as health problems causing diseases such as anemia, sleep disorders, depression...\nForgetful, forgetful\nOver time, men's testosterone and cognitive abilities, especially memory, decline. A study at Monash University (Australia) shows that Testosterone helps protect neurons and brings more oxygen to the brain. However, as we age, Testosterone levels in the brain decrease, causing memory loss.\nSmall testicle size\nLow testosterone levels in the body are also the \"culprit\" that causes the testicles to be smaller than average. Because the body needs Testosterone to develop sexual organs, including the penis and testicles. When Testosterone exists at low levels, it will cause the penis or testicles to be small, even disproportionate. However, small testicles have many other causes.\nAnemia\nTestosterone plays a role in stimulating the bone marrow to create hematopoiesis, increasing red and white blood cells. According to a research article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, doctors link low testosterone with an increased risk of anemia. When researchers administered Testosterone gel to anemic men with low Testosterone, they saw improvements in blood counts compared to men who used a placebo gel. Some symptoms that anemia can cause include difficulty concentrating, cramps, difficulty sleeping, dizziness, and an abnormally fast heart rate.\nIn addition, low Testosterone also causes other diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and thyroid-related diseases."
