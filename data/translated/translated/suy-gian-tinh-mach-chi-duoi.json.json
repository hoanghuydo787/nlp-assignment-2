    "content": "Varicose veins of the lower limbs: Causes, signs, treatment\n\nVaricose veins of the lower limbs progress silently, can cause complications of superficial and deep vein thrombosis, causing pain and edema of the lower limbs. If not treated early, the disease can cause bleeding, non-healing leg ulcers, etc., affecting the patient's quality of life. Statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) show that lower limb varicose veins are common in about 35% of working people, about 50% of retired people, and the incidence rate in women is 3 times higher. male. Symptoms of the disease are often silent and unclear, so they do not receive proper care.\n\nWhat is lower limb varicose veins?\nVaricose veins of the lower limbs, also known as varicose veins of the legs,Â is a condition in which blood in the venous system stagnates in the legs and does not go up the vena cava to return to the heart as usual. This condition increases hydrostatic pressure within the veins, causing the veins to dilate. If not treated promptly and properly, the disease will continue to progress and the arterial blood flow to the legs will also decrease.\nAs a result, the patient will experience a feeling of heaviness in the legs, aches and pains, leg swelling, numbness, numbness, tingling, cramps at night... Even more severe cases of leg blood circulation disorders can lead to to complications such as eczema, non-healing leg ulcers... making treatment longer and more difficult. Varicose veins in young people have tended to increase recently.\n\nCauses of varicose veins of the lower limbs\nIn the normal mechanism, the venous blood flow from the legs back to the heart is maintained in one direction from bottom to top (opposite to the direction of gravity when in a standing position) thanks to the venous valve system, suction force is created. due to the activity of the heart, chest wall muscles and pressure of the lower leg muscles.\nEffects that affect the mechanism of maintaining this one-way blood flow such as holding a standing position for a long time, compressing the pelvic veins, not exercising the leg muscles... over time will cause the one-way valve to no longer maintain its function. function, causing the vein walls to dilate, weaken and create a reflux of blood through the valve along the axis of the great saphenous veins, small saphenous veins or deep veins in the opposite direction down to the legs. The reflux causes increased pressure in the large veins, then passes through the small veins, dilating both large and small veins.\nVenous valve insufficiency can occur in each region or the entire leg.\nLarge varicose veins under the skin C2\nStatistics in adults show that about 73% of women and 56% of men have varicose veins. Women have a higher incidence rate, the cause is determined to be due to the influence of female hormones, pregnancy causing compression and obstruction of venous blood. Some professions and jobs such as sales, weaving, sewing, seafood processing, teachers... that require standing for long periods of time have a higher rate of illness. People who are obese, sedentary or work with heavy loads... are also susceptible to varicose veins.\nYou may be interested in: Varicose veins during pregnancy\n\nSymptoms of varicose veins in the legs\nIn the early stages, symptoms of the disease are often unclear and transient. Patients have a feeling of heaviness in their feet and may find their shoes tighter than usual. In more severe cases, the patient may feel fatigue in the legs, slight swelling when standing for long periods of time, a feeling of pins and needles or crawling in the lower leg, cramps at night... The patient can also see blood vessels. Tiny on the surface of the skin like a spider vein or larger and deeper like a mesh in the subcutaneous layer. The above symptoms may disappear when the patient rests, the varicose veins are not much, sometimes dilated, sometimes not, so the patient pays little attention and is easy to ignore.\nIn the advanced stage, the patient's legs begin to show signs of swelling in the ankles or feet. Skin color changes appear in the lower leg area, a sign of dystrophy due to long-term venous blood stasis. Dilated veins cause pain in the legs, and blood escapes into the vessels, causing leg swelling. This phenomenon does not disappear when resting. In more severe cases, you can often see large, clearly visible veins on the skin, bruises on the skin...\nWhen varicose veins enter the complication stage, the superficial veins dilate into tufts, become inflamed, and create blood clots in their hearts. Combined with ulcers caused by malnutrition, it can create ulcers, infections...\n\nProgressive stage of lower limb varicose veins\nThe system is applied to divide according to CAEP, in which the stage of disease progression and clinical severity are divided into C1-C6 as follows:\nC1: Spider or reticular varicose veins; C2: Large varicose veins under the skin >3mm; C3: Edema; C4: Changes in skin structure and subcutaneous tissue (eczema); C5: Ulcers can heal; C6: Ulcer does not heal\nTypical images of the progression of lower limb varicose veins\n\nDiagnosis of varicose veins of the lower limbs\nClinical examination: Varicose veins can be diagnosed by exploiting risk factors and symptoms of the patient. In patients with thin subcutaneous tissue, the veins can be seen and felt to dilate and stretch quickly when moving from a lying to standing position.; Vascular Doppler ultrasound: Ultrasound confirms the diagnosis when recording reflux flow through the venous valve with a duration of >0.5 seconds in the saphenous vein and deep vein in the lower leg or >0.1 second in the femoral popliteal vein . Ultrasound can identify damage to the greater saphenous, lesser saphenous, deep veins, and perforating venous valves to help choose the appropriate treatment technique.\nSee more sharing from THS.BS Nguyen Anh Dung about the disease Varicose Veins of the lower limbs\n\nTreatment of varicose veins of the lower limbs at Tam Anh General Hospital\nAt the Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, examination and diagnosis of varicose veins in the legs are performed with modern equipment, combined with \"individualized\" treatment regimens, applying many advanced techniques in the treatment of varicose veins. Treatment such as: Medical treatment, surgery or laser or intravascular radiofrequency to remove diseased superficial veins... helps patients escape pain and prevent dangerous complications.\nInternally medical treatment\nDrugs that increase the strength of vein walls such as daflon, ginko biloba, rutin C help improve symptoms and slow down disease progression. However, these drugs are only effective in the early stages of the disease, supporting stabilization after endovenous laser or radiofrequency treatments. Physical therapy with air bags that create intermittent pressure in layers along with leg muscle exercises to help create better venous circulation and strengthen the blood vessel walls are techniques to improve symptoms and disease condition. .\nThe air bag creates intermittent pressure in stages\nRemoval of diseased superficial veins\nSuperficial varicose veins ranging from C2 to C6 according to the grading described above require surgery or intravascular laser or radiofrequency to remove diseased superficial veins.\nSurgery\nStripping: Removing varicose superficial veins with a specialized instrument inserted into the vein is called Stripping surgery. This is a fairly thorough treatment method, with the lowest recurrence rate. Before the 2000s, saphenous vein stripping surgery was the main technique to treat varicose veins of the lower limbs. Over the past 10 years, endovenous laser and radiofrequency techniques have been applied and have brought very good results. Today, with the development of intravenous laser and radiofrequency techniques, stripping surgery has almost completely replaced; CHIVA: This is the abbreviation for the technique \"Cure conservatrice et Hemodynamique de L'Insuffisance Veineuse en Ambulatoire\", which is a small surgery with local anesthesia, only removing the damaged valve and removing the collateral vein. The goal is to preserve the saphenous vein, keeping it as a grafted blood vessel for blood vessel bypass surgeries such as coronary artery bypass, lower limb artery bypass... To perform the CHIVA technique well, the doctor will perform an ultrasound assessment. Accurately mark the location of damaged venous valves and collateral veins.\nPreoperative ultrasound to mark (mapping) damaged veins\nLaser or intravascular RFA\nSuperficial veins, the greater saphenous vein or the lesser saphenous vein, are indicated if there is damage identified on ultrasound. The doctor will insert a laser or radiofrequency energy wire into the varicose veins. This guide wire insertion process is performed under ultrasound guidance. After determining that the tip of the guide wire is in the correct position to be treated, the heat energy generated at the tip of the guide wire will create a reaction that causes the endothelium to become fibrous, the vessel wall to shrink, and the vein to atrophy. The guide wire will be pulled back at 1cm intervals while the guide wire generates energy, until it is completely pulled back out of the vein.\nLaser/RFA energy shrinks and atrophies the veins\n\nCare and monitoring after surgery to treat varicose veins of the lower limbs\nElastic bandage or intravenous stockings (stockings) on the first day after surgery or procedure and when standing up and walking in the following days. Intravenous stockings are recommended to be continued for 10 days to 2 weeks to avoid leg swelling. Patients need to be re-examined and examined with ultrasound after 1 month, 6 months and every 1-2 years. Disease prevention measures such as not sitting or standing for long periods of time in one place, exercising leg muscles, wearing compression stockings... continue to be recommended by doctors.\nSee more:Â What to avoid and what to eat if you have varicose veins? 7 super good foods\n\nPrevention of varicose veins in the legs\nApplying measures to reduce venous valve reflux helps prevent the disease, as well as improve the condition. Patients are advised to avoid standing or sitting for a long time in one place, perform varicose vein exercises, keep their feet elevated when sitting or lying down, practice active breathing, and eat a diet high in fiber to avoid constipation and obesity. ..., wear specialized pressure socks.\nReference: Should you walk with varicose veins in your legs?\nThe socks create pressure that gradually decreases from the bottom up, helping to push blood from the feet upward toward the heart\nCardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital brings together a team of doctors who are leading experts in the field of cardiology in Vietnam, possessing the most modern machinery and equipment system in the world. In particular, the operating room system is equipped with state-of-the-art equipment such as the high-end Artis Pheno angiography robot system, DSA angiography machine... allowing to best meet all the requirements of simple cardiovascular intervention techniques. to complexity.\nFor advice and to schedule an examination with leading cardiovascular experts at Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nVaricose veins of the lower limbs need to be screened, detected and treated early to achieve the highest treatment effectiveness, ensuring aesthetics, health and quality of life for patients.
