This article is expertly advised by MSc. Le Thi Ngoc Hang - Doctor at Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City.\nVaricose veins are a common condition, affecting the patient's aesthetics and quality of life\n\nWhat is deep varicose veins of the lower limbs?\nDeep vein insufficiency of the lower extremities is a well-understood condition in which damage to the venous valves leads to the appearance of blood reflux in the venous system under the effect of gravity and pressure. pump response. Reflux causes venous blood stagnation in the periphery, causing physical symptoms such as pain, cramps, leg swelling, metabolic disorders, eczema, non-healing ulcers...\nVaricose veins are changes in the morphology of superficial veins. Veins increase in size, dilate, swell, lengthen, bend, twist, and are clearly visible on the skin and palpable.\nSee more: What is varicose veins of the lower limbs?\n\nCauses of deep venous valve insufficiency\n1. Age\nAge is the first studied factor in relation to venous disease. Currently, all authors recognize that advanced age is a factor that increases the risk of chronic venous insufficiency and varicose veins in the legs. The usual age for varicose veins is 45-50 years old or older. The older you get, the more severe varicose veins become.\n2. Gender\nMany studies show that varicose veins are more common in women than men. For every 2-3 female patients with the disease, only 1 male patient has varicose veins. However, some studies show that, for chronic venous insufficiency, the incidence rate between men and women is similar. The difference in incidence between men and women in varicose veins is probably explained by the fact that women often have to go through pregnancy.\nIn large, multicenter studies in Germany and Italy, it was noted that in women with venous insufficiency, the rate of leg edema was often higher than in men; Meanwhile, men with varicose veins are often more susceptible to eczema and leg ulcers than women.\n3. Occupation – Habit of standing for long periods of time\nAccording to previous studies, occupations related to the habit of standing for long periods of time, walking a lot... have been identified as risk factors that increase the incidence of chronic venous insufficiency and varicose veins in the legs. However, this is just a hypothesis because medicine has not clearly proven by what mechanism the habit of standing for long periods of time causes varicose veins. There are also a few recent studies showing that standing for long periods of time is not related, or only slightly related, to varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency of the legs.\n4. Family nature\nStudies show that venous insufficiency and varicose veins run in families. If one person has the disease, other blood relatives in the family are also susceptible to the same disease, with a frequency of 1.5-2 times that of normal people. However, currently medicine has not yet proven whether the disease is hereditary or not and has not determined whether there is a gene that causes the disease or not.\n5. Obesity\nThe role of obesity in the relationship with varicose veins still has many conflicting opinions. According to research in the UK, a BMI >27 increases the risk of varicose veins in women, but does not increase this risk in men. Another large study in Germany (Bonn study) showed that BMI > 30 only insignificantly increased the risk of varicose veins in women, but clearly increased the risk of varicose veins in both men and women. male and female.\n6. Pregnancy\nPregnancy, multiple births, and pregnancy increase the risk of varicose veins in the legs. Women who have been pregnant and have had multiple pregnancies are twice as likely to get the disease as non-pregnant women and men.\n7. Hormones – Birth control pills\nUse of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis. However, birth control pills and hormones have not been linked to venous insufficiency and varicose veins, and do not increase the risk of this disease.\n8. Chronic constipation\nSome authors consider chronic constipation as a risk factor for varicose veins. However, to date, studies have not shown enough evidence that this is a real risk factor for this disease.\nAccording to MSc. Le Thi Ngoc Hang - Doctor at Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, although these factors increase a person's risk of disease, they do not necessarily cause the disease. Some people with one or more risk factors never develop varicose veins, while others develop them and have no known risk factors. However, knowing the risk factors for any disease can help guide us in taking appropriate actions, including behavioral changes and clinical monitoring.\n\nSymptoms of deep venous insufficiency\nEach individual may experience different symptoms of lower extremity venous insufficiency. Symptoms may include:\nHeavy and tired legs; Footsore; Swollen feet in the afternoon; Foot numbness; Cramps, cramps; Sensation of paresthesias: burning legs, tingling\nSevere varicose veins can cause mild swelling over long periods of time and lead to more serious problems of skin discoloration, eczema, scleroderma, and eventual ulceration of the inner ankles and ulcers. not healthy.\nMSc. Dr. Le Thi Ngoc Hang advises that the symptoms of varicose veins can be similar to other medical conditions or problems. Therefore, patients should go to the hospital for examination to get an accurate diagnosis to be able to receive effective treatment.\n\nComplications of deep varicose veins\nCommon serious complications of deep varicose veins include:\n1. Deep vein thrombosis\nWhen suffering from venous insufficiency of the lower limbs, venous blood cannot return to the heart correctly, often the venous valves are weak and open, so venous blood rushes to the legs, creating stagnant blood flow. There are two types of blood clots: superficial blood clots in cases of superficial varicose veins (or phlebitis) and deep vein blood clots called deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\nA blood clot in a deep vein can travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism, leading to death. This is one of the most serious health risks associated with untreated varicose veins.\n2. Bleeding\nSome people are at risk of bleeding when enlarged superficial veins near the surface of the skin burst. If varicose veins bleed, stop the bleeding quickly.\nLeg elevation: Lie down on a flat surface and elevate your legs. You can use a few pillows for support.; Apply firm pressure: Place a clean cloth or towel over the bleeding area and press firmly, for at least 10 minutes.; If bleeding is heavy or does not stop, see your doctor immediately.\n3. Ulcers\nAbout 70% of leg ulcers are caused by venous problems, especially venous insufficiency. Symptoms include swelling, rash and brown discoloration on the affected areas, most commonly the lower third of the leg focusing on the inside of the ankle. This condition can cause pain and fatigue for the patient. Treatment is often long and expensive, affecting quality of life and the economy.\n4. Lipodermatosclerosis\nLower extremity venous insufficiency is a major symptom of a disease called Lipodermatosclerosis (LDS). People with this condition often experience pain, hardening of the skin, changes in skin color, swelling and tapering of the legs above the ankles.\nLDS is described as a disease of the skin and connective tissue. If left untreated, lipodermatosclerosis can lead to chronic venous leg ulcers, which are difficult to heal. LDS also severely limits the ability to walk or run and can adversely affect a person's overall health.\n\nDiagnosis of deep varicose veins of the lower limbs\nDetermining the diagnosis is mainly based on clinical examination including seeing dilated and tortuous veins, skin discoloration, nutritional disorders, ulcers and the appearance of hemangiomas.\nFinally, the diagnosis is determined by color Doppler vascular ultrasound, with this method allowing us to determine hemodynamic disorders, the condition of the venous valves, the degree of vein dilation and other complications. embolism in the vessel so that you can have the right treatment attitude.\n\nTreatment methods for deep varicose veins of the lower limbs\nThere are several different ways to treat lower extremity deep venous valve insufficiency, including both surgical and nonsurgical methods.\nLaser burning method to treat varicose veins in the legs at the Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, HCM\n1. Foam sclerotherapy under ultrasound guidance\nHowever, due to its limited nature due to high recurrence rate and risk of pulmonary embolism, according to the current treatment protocol of the American Society of Venepuncture, foam sclerotherapy is only applied to cases of cardiovascular failure. Grade C1 veins, meaning telangiectasia and reticular veins located superficially under the skin, are not indicated for occlusion or elimination of reflux in the saphenous vein.\n2. Endovenous laser intervention or RFA\nThis method is guided by ultrasound and is commonly used to treat the great saphenous veins.\nFor this procedure, the patient is given local anesthesia and a laser fiber is inserted into the great saphenous vein. The emitted energy is converted into heat, causing destruction, shrinkage, and atrophy of the vein requiring intervention. The treated vein will become clogged and no longer circulate blood. Endovascular intervention techniques are always superior because they are less invasive, quicker to recover, and more aesthetic.\n3. VenaSeal vein glue\nThis is the newest and most modern minimally invasive treatment technology for deep varicose veins today. This method is performed by injecting VenaSeal glue through a small catheter into the abnormal vein to harden it. Once the vein closes, blood is safely redirected into healthy veins in the leg.\n4. Compression stockings\nCompression therapy is an effective treatment modality whose mechanism is still not fully understood. Clinical effectiveness depends on two main factors: surface pressure and calf muscle stiffness.\nSuperficial pressure is the pressure exerted by the stocking on the surface of the diseased skin. The pressure of the socks is carefully calculated in the laboratory so that the socks are manufactured.\nCompression stockings are woven with special techniques so that the pressure applied to each segment of the leg is consistent with normal physiology, being tighter at the ankle and gradually loosening as you go up, always hugging the leg and pushing blood out. follow the veins to the heart.\nMild varicose veins can be treated with compression stockings, combined with changes in standing and sitting habits and diet.\n\nPreventive measures for deep varicose veins of the lower limbs\nLifestyle changes and home remedies for varicose veins include:\nExercise: Walking is a great way to encourage blood flow in the legs. Walk and wear compression stockings or exercise as recommended by your specialist. In addition, some varicose vein exercises are also very useful for the treatment process.; Weight control: Losing excess weight will remove unnecessary pressure from the veins.; Choose appropriate footwear: Avoid wearing high heels. Instead, you should wear low heels because it helps work your calf muscles more. This is better for your veins.; Avoid tight clothing: Do not wear tight clothing around the waist, legs or groin as these types of clothing can reduce blood flow.; Elevate your legs: To improve blood flow in your legs, sit with your legs elevated. Sleep with your legs about 10cm higher than your heart level. Rest a few times a day to raise your legs higher than your heart. For example, lie down with your feet resting on three or four pillows.; Avoid sitting or standing for long periods of time: Change your position often to stimulate blood flow.\nDeep varicose veins can cause discomfort and affect quality of life. Medical treatment of varicose veins and changes in diet and lifestyle will help improve symptoms. People with severe venous insufficiency need treatment with medical methods. But it is important that you go to the hospital for examination as soon as symptoms suspected of varicose veins appear to receive timely treatment and prevent complications.",
