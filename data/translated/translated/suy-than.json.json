    "content": "Kidney failure: Causes, signs, diagnosis and treatment\n\nAccording to 2019 statistics, the number of people with kidney failure in our country is about 5 million. The number of new cases is also on the rise. The proportion of people moving to the final stage accounts for 0.1% of the population. Kidney failure is not only a burden on health and spirit, but also financially exhausting for many families.\n\nWhat is kidney failure?\nKidney failure is a condition in which the kidneys lose function and are no longer able to filter waste products from the blood. This is the final stage of chronic kidney disease. Without dialysis or a kidney transplant, the patient will have difficulty maintaining life. (first)\n\nClassification of kidney failure\nAccording to the distinguished physician Associate Professor, Dr. Vu Le Chuyen - Director of the Center for Urology and Nephrology, the disease is divided into 5 types based on the pathogenesis: 1. Acute pre-renal kidney failure This is a case of kidney failure Acute occurs when there is insufficient blood flow to the kidneys, affecting the kidneys' ability to eliminate toxins. The cause of this condition is injury, surgery or other diseases. Symptoms of acute pre-renal kidney failure are often: loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, seizures, coma... This type of disease can be cured, if the doctor identifies the cause of reduced blood flow. 2. Acute Intrinsic Renal Failure Acute intrinsic renal failure can be caused by direct trauma to the kidney, such as physical impacts or accidents. Causes also include toxin overload and ischemia or lack of oxygen to the kidneys. Among them, the causes of ischemia include: serious bleeding, renal vascular obstruction, glomerulonephritis... 3. Prerenal chronic renal failure When there is insufficient renal perfusion for a long time, the kidney start to shrink. Gradually, the kidneys lose their ability to function, which is called chronic prerenal renal failure. 4. Chronic renal failure in the kidneys This condition of chronic kidney failure occurs when the kidneys are damaged long-term due to diseases occurring in the kidneys such as glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis, tubular nephritis... Internal kidney diseases develop from trauma Direct injury to the kidneys includes severe bleeding or lack of oxygen. 5. Postrenal chronic kidney failure Long-term urinary tract obstruction, including high urinary tract obstruction and lower urinary tract obstruction, will prevent urine from escaping. This puts pressure on the kidneys and ultimately damages them.\n\nStages of kidney failure\nKidney failure is classified into 5 stages, from very mild (stage 1) to completely impaired kidney function (stage 5). Symptoms and complications of the disease increase as the stages progress. Specifically: Stage 1 This stage is very mild. Patients may be asymptomatic and have no obvious complications. In stage 1, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help control and slow the progression of the disease. Stage 2 Kidney failure in stage 2 is still considered a mild form, but problems can be detected through a slightly reduced glomerular filtration rate, protein in the urine, or physical damage to the kidneys that may be apparent. than. Methods of maintaining an active lifestyle are still used in stage 2, but patients should talk to their doctors about other risk factors that can make the disease progress faster. Stage 3 Disease at this stage is considered intermediate, sometimes divided into 3A and 3B. The patient's kidneys do not function as well as normal. Symptoms may become more obvious such as swollen hands and feet, back pain and frequent urination. Stage 4 Stage 4 kidney disease is considered moderate-severe. The kidneys do not function well, but the patient's kidney function has not yet completely declined. Symptoms can include complications such as anemia, high blood pressure, and bone and joint disease. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains vital to controlling and preventing disease progression. At the same time, your doctor will prescribe appropriate treatments to slow down kidney damage. Stage 5 At stage 5, the patient's kidneys have completely failed. Symptoms of kidney function decline become obvious, including vomiting and nausea, difficulty breathing, itchy skin...\n\nSigns of kidney failure\nUsually patients with kidney failure will have some symptoms of the disease, but sometimes there are no symptoms. Some manifestations of this condition that may occur include: (2)\nDecreased urine output; Swollen ankles and feet; Shortness of breath of unknown cause; Chest pain or feeling of heaviness; Excessive sleepiness, fatigue, drowsiness; Poor appetite, persistent nausea, vomiting; Weight loss; Itchy; Muscle cramps (especially in the legs); Convulsion; Comatose; Anemia (rare)\nSome early signs of kidney failure\nSymptoms of early stage kidney disease can be difficult to identify. However, you should be cautious, if initial signs appear such as: little urination, swelling of the limbs, difficulty breathing... When starting treatment, these symptoms will improve and the patient will feel better. much healthier.\n\nCauses of kidney failure\nThe disease can be the result of a number of health problems, and determining the cause is helpful in helping to identify the type of kidney failure. The cause of the disease can come from some of the following factors:\nReduced blood flow to the kidneys\nA sudden loss of blood flow to the kidneys will likely lead to kidney failure. This condition is often due to causes such as: heart disease, liver scarring or liver failure, severe burns, allergic reactions, severe infections such as sepsis, etc. Use of high blood pressure and anti-inflammatory drugs can also occur. can limit blood flow to the kidneys.\nUrine excretion problem\nWhen the body cannot eliminate urine, toxins will accumulate and overload the kidneys. Causes of this condition include some cancers in the colon, bladder, prostate (in men), cervix (in women)...\nOther conditions that can interfere with urination and over time lead to kidney failure such as: kidney stones, prostate enlargement, blood clots in the urinary tract, damage to the nerves that control the bladder, etc.\nOther causes\nSome other causes that can lead to kidney failure include:\nBlood clots appear in or around the kidney; Infection; Heavy metal poisoning; Vasculitis; Lupus; Glomerulonephritis; Hemolytic uremic syndrome; Multiple myeloma; Scleroderma; Hemorrhage causes thrombotic thrombocytopenia; Medicines to treat cancer and some autoimmune diseases; Dye used in diagnostic imaging; Some antibiotics; Uncontrolled diabetes; Kidney aging due to age (this is one of the main causes of kidney failure in the elderly)\n\nComplications of kidney failure\nAlthough dialysis can help reduce pressure on the kidneys and make them stronger, it cannot completely replace kidney function. Therefore, sick people are still at risk of dangerous complications, even leading to death. Some of the most common complications of kidney failure include:\nAnemia\nAnyone can get anemia, but the condition is more common in people with chronic kidney disease. Patients may start to have anemia in the early stages, but it becomes more severe in stages 3-5. The cause of this condition is that the kidneys help the body create red blood cells. When the kidneys do not function normally, the body will lack red blood cells, causing anemia.\nBone disease and hyperphosphatemia\nEach person needs calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus to have strong bones. When the kidneys are healthy, they will keep the levels of these substances stable and protect bone health. If impaired function, the kidneys may not be able to perform this balancing role. In particular, when the kidneys are weak, phosphorus is not excreted but accumulates in the blood, called hyperphosphatemia, which is dangerous.\nHeart disease\nCardiovascular and kidney diseases are closely related. At the same time, heart disease is the most common cause of death in people on dialysis.\nThis is explained as heart disease will affect blood circulation. Blood backed up in the heart causes pressure to build up in the main vein connected to the kidneys, which can lead to blockage and reduced oxygenated blood supply to the kidneys. This can cause kidney disease.\nAnd like a cycle, when the kidneys are not working well, the patient's hormone system that regulates blood pressure has to work harder to increase blood supply to the kidneys. At that time, the heart has to work harder, leading to heart disease.\nHyperkalemia\nPotassium exists mainly in foods and helps muscles function, including the muscles that control heart rate and breathing. If the kidneys are healthy, they will excrete excess potassium to balance the concentration of this substance in the blood.\nFor people with kidney failure, the kidneys cannot or do not eliminate excess potassium, causing too much of this component to exist in the blood, called hyperkalemia. This condition can cause a heart attack or lead to death. The most common symptoms of hyperkalemia are: feeling tired, weak, stomach pain, nausea, muscle pain or cramps, shortness of breath, abnormal heart rate, chest pain...\nAccumulation of water in the body\nHealthy kidneys will remove excess fluid in the blood, avoiding the risk of accumulation causing problems in the heart and lungs, high blood pressure... Symptoms of this condition are a faster heart beat and swollen feet. When water accumulates in the body, patients are often advised to limit water intake and follow a low-salt diet...\nMental health\nKidney failure not only affects physical health but also affects mental factors. The more severe the disease, the more the patient's mental health is affected. Some stressors may include:\nFinancial pressure during dialysis; Must adhere to strict dialysis schedule; Feeling like a burden to others; Pain, fatigue, poor sleep, diet; Work is affected\n\nDiagnostic method\nThere are many causes of weak kidneys. Therefore, to find the cause and have an effective treatment plan, your doctor may prescribe:\nKidney ultrasound\nThis is often the first indication for sick people because it is easy to perform and inexpensive... Kidney imaging examination using high-frequency sound waves to evaluate kidney size, structure and regional pathologies resides in the kidney…\nCT computed tomography scan\nComputed tomography (CT) to create images of the inside of the body. This imaging diagnostic method is often used to give doctors an overview of the causes of disease.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nThis method is used to evaluate the patient's kidney failure through symptoms: blood in urine, frequent urinary tract infections, monitoring patients with a history of urinary tract cancer...\nKidney scintigraphy\nRenal scintigraphy is one of the highly valuable diagnostic techniques in evaluating kidney pathology. The role of kidney scintigraphy is to provide information about kidney morphology, function, ability to excrete urine... Kidney scintigraphy is safe for patients who are sensitive to contrast agents, so X-rays cannot be performed. .\nBiopsy\nThis is a method of removing a piece of kidney tissue, under the guidance of imaging diagnostic equipment, to assess kidney condition and the risk of malignant diseases. This method is often performed after other common diagnostic imaging methods.\n\nTreatment methods for kidney failure\nKidney disease cannot be completely cured, but if there is an effective treatment regimen, it will still ensure the patient has an active, comfortable life and can continue to study and work. Treatment for kidney failure depends on the cause of the disease, specifically:\nInternally medical treatment\nSupportive care and medical treatment can help control symptoms effectively. Patients do not need dialysis or a kidney transplant. It is important to understand that supportive care and treatment to control symptoms is not a cure for kidney failure and does not guarantee longevity. These treatments can only help the patient live a more comfortable life until they can no longer maintain it.\nSee more: Summary of the best drugs to treat kidney failure today\n\n\nArtificial blood filtration (hemodialysis)\nArtificial hemodialysis is the use of a machine outside the body to clean waste from the blood instead of kidney function. After purifying all toxins, the blood will be returned to the patient's body. Depending on the type of dialysis, you may be connected to a specialized machine or a portable catheter bag. Indications for hemodialysis are used in cases where patients have complications such as brain dysfunction, increased potassium but do not respond to medical treatment, and creatinine clearance drops below 10ml/min/1.73m2 body. Blood dialysis can be performed regularly 3 times a week at medical facilities. This method brings certain effects to people with kidney failure, but cannot fully perform the role of a healthy kidney. This means that people may still experience some health problems related to this condition, even though they are on dialysis. Currently, dialysis can be performed at medical facilities or at home, if qualified.\nPeritoneal dialysis\nPeritoneal dialysis (PD) is a method of cleaning waste from the blood using the patient's own abdominal lining (called the peritoneum). Peritoneal dialysis is performed using a special solution called dialysate. Peritoneal dialysis can be performed in the hospital, or even at home or work, if the patient can prepare a clean, private room.\nCurrently there are 3 methods of peritoneal dialysis:\nAcute peritoneal dialysis; Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD); Automated peritoneal dialysis (ADP) includes continuous peritoneal dialysis, nocturnal intermittent peritoneal dialysis, and tidal peritoneal dialysis\nDuring peritoneal dialysis, dialysis fluid flows through a tube (catheter) into your abdomen. The abdominal lining acts as a filter and removes waste products from the patient's blood. After a certain period of time, the filtrate with waste products is drained from the abdomen and discarded. These methods can be done at home, work or while traveling. But peritoneal dialysis is not an optimal choice for everyone with kidney failure. Because this method needs to be operated by an experienced person, capable of taking care of the patient at home and with certain equipment.\nKidney transplant\nAnother treatment option for people with kidney failure is a kidney transplant. A healthy kidney is replaced by a kidney that has lost up to 90% of its ability to function normally,  no longer able to filter blood.\nKidney sources for transplantation can be from living kidney donors (relative or non-relative) or brain dead donors. This is considered the best treatment option for people with kidney failure because it can increase the chances of living a longer, healthier life. Patients receive a kidney transplant when their kidneys are near failure, before needing dialysis and can also be used with dialysis while waiting for a kidney transplant.\nKidney transplant surgery is considered safe and has a high success rate. Studies have shown that patients who receive a kidney from a living donor live longer than patients who receive a kidney from a brain-dead donor (someone who has recently passed away). On average, kidney transplants from living donors last 15-20 years and from deceased donors last 10-15 years.\nHowever, when choosing a kidney transplant, the patient may also face some risks such as thrombosis, bleeding, ureteral leakage or blockage, infection, and cancer related to the newly transplanted kidney. donate. In particular, kidney transplant recipients must take immunosuppressive drugs for life after surgery to prevent the body from rejecting the new kidney. These medications have their own side effects and some of them are very serious.\nImplant surgery may not be the right option for everyone. Therefore, patients should talk to their treating doctor for more detailed advice.\n\nPrevent kidney failure\nKidney failure is one of the dangerous diseases. However, the fortunate thing is that we can completely reduce the risk of kidney failure according to the following advice from nephrologists:\nManage other diseases effectively: Diabetes and high blood pressure increase the risk of disease. Therefore, you should monitor the disease closely, comply with the treatment regimen...; Be careful when using over-the-counter medications: Because taking too high a dose (even common medications like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen) can create high levels of toxins in a short period of time, causing the kidneys to become overloaded. load.; Maintain a healthy weight: Obesity can increase the risk of conditions related to kidney disease, such as diabetes and high blood pressure.; Build a healthy diet: Include eating low in sugar and cholesterol, rich in fiber, whole grains, fruits and vegetables.; Reduce salt intake: Eating too much salt increases blood pressure, easily leading to kidney failure; Drink enough water: Dehydration reduces blood flow to the kidneys, which can damage the kidneys. Therefore, drinking enough water is one of the good habits for the kidneys that is always recommended by doctors.; Limit alcohol: Alcohol increases blood pressure. At the same time, excess calories can also make you gain weight.; Don't smoke: Smoking reduces blood flow to the kidneys, affecting kidney function in people with or without kidney disease.; Reduce stress: Stress and anxiety can increase blood pressure, negatively affecting kidney health; Exercise regularly: Sports can help reduce stress, control diabetes and high blood pressure, and maintain a healthy weight. Patients should choose sports that are suitable for their health such as swimming, walking and running...\nIf you have symptoms of kidney disease, you should see your doctor as soon as possible for a comprehensive evaluation. Early diagnosis and treatment helps slow the progression of kidney failure. If you have kidney failure, you should regularly see your doctor to monitor your kidney function and slow its progression with appropriate treatments.

If the kidneys are healthy, they will excrete excess potassium to balance the concentration of this substance in the blood.\nFor people with kidney failure, the kidneys cannot or do not eliminate excess potassium, causing too much of this component to exist in the blood, called hyperkalemia. This condition can cause a heart attack or lead to death. The most common symptoms of hyperkalemia are: feeling tired, weak, stomach pain, nausea, muscle pain or cramps, shortness of breath, abnormal heart rate, chest pain...\nAccumulation of water in the body\nHealthy kidneys will remove excess fluid in the blood, avoiding the risk of accumulation causing problems in the heart and lungs, high blood pressure... Symptoms of this condition are a faster heart beat and swollen feet. When water accumulates in the body, patients are often advised to limit water intake and follow a low-salt diet...\nMental health\nKidney failure not only affects physical health but also affects mental factors. The more severe the disease, the more the patient's mental health is affected. Some stressors may include:\nFinancial pressure during dialysis; Must adhere to strict dialysis schedule; Feeling like a burden to others; Pain, fatigue, poor sleep, diet; Work is affected",
            "subsection_string": "Complications of kidney failure\nAlthough dialysis can help reduce pressure on the kidneys and make them stronger, it cannot completely replace kidney function. Therefore, sick people are still at risk of dangerous complications, even leading to death. Some of the most common complications of kidney failure include:\nAnemia\nAnyone can get anemia, but the condition is more common in people with chronic kidney disease. Patients may start to have anemia in the early stages, but it becomes more severe in stages 3-5. The cause of this condition is that the kidneys help the body create red blood cells. When the kidneys do not function normally, the body will lack red blood cells, causing anemia.\nBone disease and hyperphosphatemia\nEach person needs calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus to have strong bones. When the kidneys are healthy, they will keep the levels of these substances stable and protect bone health. If impaired function, the kidneys may not be able to perform this balancing role. In particular, when the kidneys are weak, phosphorus is not excreted but accumulates in the blood, called hyperphosphatemia, which is dangerous.\nHeart disease\nCardiovascular and kidney diseases are closely related. At the same time, heart disease is the most common cause of death in people on dialysis.\nThis is explained as heart disease will affect blood circulation. Blood backed up in the heart causes pressure to build up in the main vein connected to the kidneys, which can lead to blockage and reduced oxygenated blood supply to the kidneys. This can cause kidney disease.\nAnd like a cycle, when the kidneys are not working well, the patient's hormone system that regulates blood pressure has to work harder to increase blood supply to the kidneys. At that time, the heart has to work harder, leading to heart disease.\nHyperkalemia\nPotassium exists mainly in foods and helps muscles function, including the muscles that control heart rate and breathing.

After purifying all toxins, the blood will be returned to the patient's body. Depending on the type of dialysis, you may be connected to a specialized machine or a portable catheter bag. Indications for hemodialysis are used in cases where patients have complications such as brain dysfunction, increased potassium but do not respond to medical treatment, and creatinine clearance drops below 10ml/min/1.73m2 body. Blood dialysis can be performed regularly 3 times a week at medical facilities. This method brings certain effects to people with kidney failure, but cannot fully perform the role of a healthy kidney. This means that people may still experience some health problems related to this condition, even though they are on dialysis. Currently, dialysis can be performed at medical facilities or at home, if qualified.\nPeritoneal dialysis\nPeritoneal dialysis (PD) is a method of cleaning waste from the blood using the patient's own abdominal lining (called the peritoneum). Peritoneal dialysis is performed using a special solution called dialysate. Peritoneal dialysis can be performed in the hospital, or even at home or work, if the patient can prepare a clean, private room.\nCurrently there are 3 methods of peritoneal dialysis:\nAcute peritoneal dialysis; Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD); Automated peritoneal dialysis (ADP) includes continuous peritoneal dialysis, nocturnal intermittent peritoneal dialysis, and tidal peritoneal dialysis\nDuring peritoneal dialysis, dialysis fluid flows through a tube (catheter) into your abdomen. The abdominal lining acts as a filter and removes waste products from the patient's blood. After a certain period of time, the filtrate with waste products is drained from the abdomen and discarded. These methods can be done at home, work or while traveling. But peritoneal dialysis is not an optimal choice for everyone with kidney failure. Because this method needs to be operated by an experienced person, capable of taking care of the patient at home and with certain equipment.\nKidney transplant\nAnother treatment option for people with kidney failure is a kidney transplant. A healthy kidney is replaced by a kidney that has lost up to 90% of its ability to function normally,  no longer able to filter blood.\nKidney sources for transplantation can be from living kidney donors (relative or non-relative) or brain dead donors. This is considered the best treatment option for people with kidney failure because it can increase the chances of living a longer, healthier life. Patients receive a kidney transplant when their kidneys are near failure, before needing dialysis and can also be used with dialysis while waiting for a kidney transplant.\nKidney transplant surgery is considered safe and has a high success rate. Studies have shown that patients who receive a kidney from a living donor live longer than patients who receive a kidney from a brain-dead donor (someone who has recently passed away). On average, kidney transplants from living donors last 15-20 years and from deceased donors last 10-15 years.\nHowever, when choosing a kidney transplant, the patient may also face some risks such as thrombosis, bleeding, ureteral leakage or blockage, infection, and cancer related to the newly transplanted kidney. donate. In particular, kidney transplant recipients must take immunosuppressive drugs for life after surgery to prevent the body from rejecting the new kidney.
