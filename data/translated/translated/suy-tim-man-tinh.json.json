    "content": "Chronic heart failure: Causes, symptoms and diagnosis\n\nChronic heart failure is a long-term condition that gradually becomes more severe over time, often affecting older adults and people with other cardiovascular diseases. This article is expertly advised by Associate Professor, Dr. Pham Nguyen Vinh - Director of the Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nWhat is chronic heart failure?\nChronic heart failure or chronic heart failure is a condition in which the heart cannot continuously pump enough blood throughout the body to ensure adequate oxygen supply. There are many causes leading to this condition, including some of the most common risk factors, such as old age, diabetes, hypertension, overweight... Chronic heart failure is most common in men. (first)\nThe term “heart failure” does not mean the heart stops beating, but rather describes a condition in which the heart is weaker than normal in a healthy person. In some cases, mild heart failure causes symptoms that can only be noticed with exercise. In other cases, the condition can be more severe, causing life-threatening symptoms, even when the patient is resting.\n\nClassify\nChronic heart failure affects the lower chambers of the heart (right and left ventricles) and occurs when the heart cannot adapt to the body's changing oxygen needs, for example when exercising or going up and down stairs. .\nThere are different types of chronic heart failure, classified by how the heart responds to pumping blood. There are two main types: Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) and Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF). (2)\nThis condition can also be affected by the combination of HFrEF and HFpEF. Furthermore, each type can affect the left ventricle, the right ventricle, or both at the same time.\n1. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction\nHeart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), also known as systolic heart failure, occurs when the heart is too weak and does not contract normally. This is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by structural and/or functional impairment of the left ventricle, leading to reduced cardiac pumping function (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%), associated with an insufficient supply of oxygen-rich blood to meet the needs of tissues and organs.\nHFrEF is the most common type of heart failure. Although people of any age can develop this type of heart failure, it occurs most often in middle-aged and older people. In the US, HFrEF affects about 3.5 million people, of whom 36% are women. Studies over the past decade have highlighted differences between women and men with HFrEF regarding many aspects of the syndrome, including epidemiology, pathophysiology, outcomes, and treatment.\nWomen with HFrEF have fewer comorbidities, lower hospitalization rates, and better survival than men; but they also experience more symptoms and poorer functional status and health-related quality of life.\n2. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction\nHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), also known as diastolic heart failure, occurs when the heart is too stiff and does not fill with blood normally. Characteristics of HFpEF include symptoms of heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 50%. Heart failure associated with a moderate decrease in LVEF (40% to 49%) is also often included in this group.\nIn the United States, approximately 5 million people have been diagnosed with heart failure at a rate of more than 650,000 new diagnoses each year. Nearly half of heart failure patients have preserved ejection fraction. Risk factors include older age, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), valvular heart disease, and atrial fibrillation.\nThe diagnosis of HFpEF requires clinical symptoms and/or signs of heart failure, as well as evidence of preserved LVEF and diastolic dysfunction. Hypertension, CAD, and valvular heart disease are the most common causes. Identifying other underlying causes can lead to optimal treatment and the best outcomes.\nThe first step in diagnosing HFpEF is to determine the possibility of heart failure and then perform a two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to obtain the most accurate diagnosis.\n\nSymptoms of chronic heart failure\nSymptoms of chronic heart failure generally depend on the type of condition being experienced and its location, i.e. which ventricle is involved. (3)\nThe main symptom of left-sided heart failure is shortness of breath, which often gets worse with activity or when lying flat. Coughing may also appear. If the condition affects the right side of the heart, edema, a buildup of fluid that causes swelling of the legs and ankles, is the most common symptom.\nOther symptoms, which can appear regardless of which side of the heart is affected, include:\nTired; Dizziness or lightheadedness; Nausea; Loss of appetite; Constipation; Feeling weak in the legs; Fast heartbeat, even at rest, or irregular heartbeat; Chest pain or angina\nDoctors often classify a person's heart failure according to the severity of the symptoms being experienced. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system is a commonly used classification system. Patients are arranged into 4 groups:\nGroup I: Physical activity not limited by symptoms.; Group II: Physical activity is slightly limited. Rest comfortably.; Group III: Physical activity is markedly limited. Rest comfortably.; Group IV: Discomfort when performing physical activity. Even at rest, symptoms may appear.\n\nThe cause to the illness\nChronic heart failure has no single cause but is a complication of a variety of other conditions. Each disease affects the heart's ability to pump blood throughout the body.\nOne of the most common conditions that cause chronic heart failure is coronary artery disease. The disease leads to the narrowing of the coronary arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart, depriving the heart of the oxygen it needs to function effectively. Although this is a common complication of coronary artery disease, it does not occur in all cases.\nHypertension is another common cause. This condition puts additional strain on the heart, which over time can cause chronic heart failure. High blood pressure occurs when the artery walls exert a stronger force in the opposite direction, causing the heart to work harder to send blood throughout the body. This leads to increased pressure of blood in the arteries.\nOther possible causes of chronic heart failure include:\nCardiomyopathy; Heart valve disease; Congenital heart disease; Viral infections of the heart muscle, such as myocarditis; Drugs and chemicals including some chemotherapy drugs and cocaine; Drinking too much alcohol; Anemia; Thyroid disease; Due to abnormal heart rhythm and arrhythmia\nArrhythmia is one of the causes of chronic heart failure.\n\nDiagnostic method\nDiagnosis is usually based on a person's medical history, a physical exam, and certain laboratory tests, including:\nEchocardiography: This method uses high-frequency sound waves to examine heart functions. This is considered the most important tool in diagnosing heart failure.; Electrocardiogram (ECG): Used to test and record heart rhythm and electrical activity.; Chest X-ray: Can provide doctors with images of the heart and fluid buildup, if present; Blood test: To measure BNP or NT-proBNP biomarker levels. Both tend to be elevated in people with heart failure.\nIn some cases, other methods, such as urine tests and MRI scans, may also be used.\n\nIs chronic heart failure dangerous?\nBecause chronic heart failure can happen to anyone, it's important to take lifelong preventative measures to ensure heart health. This is a long-term condition that requires ongoing treatment to prevent complications. When the disease is left untreated, the heart can weaken so severely that it causes life-threatening complications. (4)\nSymptoms will likely get worse over time. Initially, medications and surgery may help relieve symptoms but may not be helpful if the person has severe chronic heart failure. Early treatment is key to preventing the most serious cases of chronic heart failure.\n\nTreatment of chronic heart failure\nOnce diagnosed, people with chronic heart failure will follow their doctor's treatment regimen. In most cases, treatment will include lifestyle and dietary changes, as well as medication.\n1. Change your lifestyle\nLifestyle and dietary changes commonly recommended for patients include:\nQuit smoking: Quit smoking and stay away from environments with lots of cigarette smoke. Doctors can advise on the best methods to stop smoking.; Limit alcohol intake: If a person's chronic heart failure is caused by drinking alcohol, it is best to stop.; Weight loss: To reduce stress on the heart, weight loss is important in overweight people.; Exercise regularly: Exercise can help reduce symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue. However, before starting a new exercise regimen, patients should consult their doctor to learn how to do it correctly and safely.; Limit salt intake: Salt can cause excess water retention in the body. Therefore, by adjusting the amount of salt in the diet can help control the disease. Your doctor will advise you on how much salt you should consume.; Check your weight daily: It is important for people who have been diagnosed with chronic heart failure to check their weight daily. If the patient gains about 2kg within 1-3 days, the patient should contact the doctor. This is a sign of fluid retention and may require intervention.\nA healthy diet can help control chronic heart failure.\n2. Using medicine\nDepending on the patient's type of chronic heart failure, the underlying cause, and the severity of the disease, the doctor will prescribe appropriate medication. In many cases, doctors may combine multiple medications or change medications over time, depending on whether hypertension and left ventricular ejection fraction are controlled. And importantly, whether the affected person still exhibits symptoms.\n3. Other treatment methods\nIn some cases, alternative treatments may be recommended by your doctor. Typically, these methods are used to treat the underlying cause of the disease.\nFor example, implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and pacemakers may be fitted to some people. In some severe cases, surgery to replace or repair the affected heart valve may be used. In other rare cases, doctors may perform a heart transplant or implant a left ventricular assist device.\n\nPrevention of chronic heart failure\nSeveral measures can be taken to help reduce the risk of developing chronic heart failure, including:\nMaintain a reasonable weight; Limit alcohol intake; Stop smoking; Exercise regularly (such as walking, swimming...); Maintain a healthy diet; It is also important to address underlying risk factors, such as hypertension and anemia. Doctors can advise on the best way to manage these conditions.\n\nFrequently asked questions\nAssociate Professor, Dr. Pham Nguyen Vinh answers frequently asked questions.\n1. What is the difference between acute and chronic heart failure?\nChronic heart failure is generally a condition that develops gradually over time, while acute heart failure, in most cases, occurs so suddenly that it is considered a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention. instantly. These two conditions share similar symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, fluid retention, and chest pain, but develop at different rates.\n2. What is the relationship between sleep apnea and chronic heart failure?\nSleep apnea, as well as other sleep-related disorders, commonly occurs in people with chronic heart failure. Such conditions can put additional strain on the heart during sleep, making heart failure worse in some people. People with sleep apnea and chronic heart failure should talk to their doctor about various treatment options.\n3. Is chronic heart failure hereditary?\nAlthough it may not be accurate to say that chronic heart failure is genetic, some risk factors that can lead to the condition may be genetic, including coronary artery disease and hypertension. In addition to genetic relatedness, family members also share lifestyle and environmental factors that can lead to disease risk.\n4. Life expectancy of the patient?\nIf treated promptly and properly, the life expectancy of people with chronic heart failure can be improved. The prognosis for this condition also depends greatly on the severity of the underlying cause. However, this is a serious condition that requires lifelong monitoring.\nInvested in modern machinery systems such as modern 4D cardiac and vascular ultrasound machines, 1.5 - 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging machine, 768-slice MSCT of the heart and coronary arteries, DSA coronary angiography system 2 aspects..., Tam Anh General Hospital Heart Center receives and treats patients with cardiovascular diseases (heart failure, hypertension, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, myocardial ischemia, congenital heart disease …).\nTreatment regimens are individualized for each patient, highly effective in improving symptoms and preventing dangerous complications of the disease.\nChronic heart failure remains the only cardiovascular disease with an increasing burden of hospitalization and high treatment costs. The incidence of the disease increases with increasing longevity, with diastolic heart failure predominating in the elderly. Preventing coronary artery disease and controlling risk factors helps prevent heart failure from progressing.",

Is chronic heart failure hereditary?\nAlthough it may not be accurate to say that chronic heart failure is genetic, some risk factors that can lead to the condition may be genetic, including coronary artery disease and hypertension. In addition to genetic relatedness, family members also share lifestyle and environmental factors that can lead to disease risk.\n4. Life expectancy of the patient?\nIf treated promptly and properly, the life expectancy of people with chronic heart failure can be improved. The prognosis for this condition also depends greatly on the severity of the underlying cause. However, this is a serious condition that requires lifelong monitoring.\nInvested in modern machinery systems such as modern 4D cardiac and vascular ultrasound machines, 1.5 - 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging machine, 768-slice MSCT of the heart and coronary arteries, DSA coronary angiography system 2 aspects..., Tam Anh General Hospital Heart Center receives and treats patients with cardiovascular diseases (heart failure, hypertension, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, myocardial ischemia, congenital heart disease …).\nTreatment regimens are individualized for each patient, highly effective in improving symptoms and preventing dangerous complications of the disease.\nChronic heart failure remains the only cardiovascular disease with an increasing burden of hospitalization and high treatment costs.

            "subsection_string": "Frequently asked questions\nAssociate Professor, Dr. Pham Nguyen Vinh answers frequently asked questions.\n1. What is the difference between acute and chronic heart failure?\nChronic heart failure is generally a condition that develops gradually over time, while acute heart failure, in most cases, occurs so suddenly that it is considered a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention. instantly. These two conditions share similar symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, fluid retention, and chest pain, but develop at different rates.\n2. What is the relationship between sleep apnea and chronic heart failure?\nSleep apnea, as well as other sleep-related disorders, commonly occurs in people with chronic heart failure. Such conditions can put additional strain on the heart during sleep, making heart failure worse in some people.
