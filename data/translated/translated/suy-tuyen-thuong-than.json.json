    "content": "Adrenal insufficiency: Causes, signs and treatments\n\nThe adrenal glands consist of two small triangular glands located on top of both kidneys. The adrenal glands produce hormones that help regulate metabolism, the immune system, blood pressure, stress response, and other essential functions. The adrenal glands consist of two parts: cortex and medulla, each responsible for producing different hormones. Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones.\n\nWhat are the adrenal glands?\nThe adrenal gland is a small, triangular endocrine gland located on top of both kidneys. The size of the adrenal gland is equivalent to a walnut. Each adrenal gland is composed of two parts: the adrenal cortex (outer part) and the adrenal medulla (inner part). Cells in different areas of the adrenal gland make different hormones. For example, the adrenal cortex produces the hormones cortisol and aldosterone. The adrenal medulla produces the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. Adrenal hormones have the function of supporting blood sugar control, maintaining stable blood pressure, and balancing sodium and electrolytes; response to stress. (first)\n\nWhat is adrenal insufficiency?\nAdrenal insufficiency is a rare disorder, which can be caused by disease of the adrenal gland (primary adrenal insufficiency - Addison's disease) or by diseases of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, long-term use of corticosteroids. (secondary adrenal insufficiency).\nWhen not treated promptly, patients are susceptible to acute adrenal insufficiency or Addisonian crisis, leading to life-threatening complications due to severe dehydration, hyponatremia, and failure to respond well to conventional rehydration measures. often. The cause of this condition may be stress, stopping taking steroids or suddenly reducing the amount of steroids. If left untreated, an Addisonian crisis can lead to shock, seizures, coma, and death. (2)\nThe adrenal glands are triangular in shape, located on top of both kidneys.\nWith acute adrenal insufficiency, the patient needs to be infused with physiological saline solution immediately. After that, the doctor injected hydrocortisone hemisuccinate, specialized treatment to adjust water and electrolytes, supplemented hormone replacement, and continuously monitored the medical condition. Once the critical situation is over, the patient needs to continue to monitor vital signs. If there are signs of recurrence, immediate treatment is required. In addition, patients will receive care, treatment to improve their health, and supplement essential vitamins...\nSigns of acute adrenal insufficiency include:\nSkin is pale, cold, feels sticky; The patient has severe vomiting and diarrhea; Rapid breathing, difficulty breathing, dizziness accompanied by severe headache.; Severe muscle weakness, loss of consciousness.\nNote, the first 24 hours after signs of acute adrenal insufficiency are a dangerous period. Dehydration, high fever, loss of consciousness, vascular disorders... can happen at any time. Patients need to be hospitalized for monitoring and have tests every 4-6 hours to evaluate the condition.\n\nCauses of adrenal insufficiency\n1. Primary adrenal insufficiency\nThe most common cause of primary AI is an autoimmune disease, meaning the body's defense system attacks and destroys the body's own tissues. When the adrenal glands are damaged, they cannot produce the hormones orthosterone and aldosterone. Other causes of primary AI include: bleeding in the glands, infections, hereditary (inherited) diseases, and adrenalectomy. (3)\n2. Secondary adrenal insufficiency\nSecondary adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which the pituitary gland does not produce enough of the hormone ACTH (adrenocorticotropin), causing the adrenal glands to not produce enough cortisol. Causes of secondary adrenal insufficiency include: pituitary adenoma, pituitary gland removed or treated with radiation, parts of the hypothalamus removed, metastatic cancer of the adrenal gland...\nA common cause in Vietnam is also due to prolonged use of corticosteroids, often in patients with asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.\nThe cause of adrenal insufficiency in Vietnam is also due to prolonged use of corticosteroids, commonly found in patients with asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nSigns of chronic adrenal insufficiency\nSymptoms of adrenal insufficiency will be different for each person. These signs may resemble other health problems. However, if left untreated, adrenal insufficiency can lead to chronic, life-threatening acute adrenal insufficiency (as stated above)...\nSigns of chronic adrenal insufficiency: (4)\nFatigue, dizziness; Dark skin, nipple area, mouth, rectum, scrotum, and vagina are blue-black; Unexplained weight loss and loss of appetite; Frequent nausea, vomiting, stomach rumbling, diarrhea; Muscle pain, low blood pressure, hypoglycemia.; Amenorrhea, irregular menstruation.\nAs soon as people see the above signs, they should see a doctor and clearly report their symptoms and condition so that the doctor can prescribe appropriate treatment.\n\nMethods of diagnosing adrenal insufficiency\nDiagnosis of adrenal insufficiency includes: blood and urine tests to check adrenal hormone and ACTH levels; X-ray, ultrasound and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).\n\nHow to treat adrenal insufficiency\nDepending on the condition and whether the disease is primary or secondary, the doctor will have different treatment plans. However, in general, people with adrenal insufficiency are treated with hormone drugs (glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids) to replace the hormones that the adrenal glands cannot produce. In specific situations, the doctor will have coordinated instructions to control health well.\nMost people with adrenal insufficiency must take hormone replacement therapy for the rest of their lives, but in some recovery cases hormone replacement therapy can be stopped.\n1. Hormone replacement\nPatients with adrenal insufficiency are given hormones to replace them, mainly the cortisol group. If you have Addison's disease, you may need to take aldosterone. Hormone replacement usually begins with intravenous (intravenous) fluids and corticosteroid medication. Your doctor will adjust the dosage of each medication to meet your body's needs. During treatment, if the patient is stressed, they often cannot tolerate oral corticosteroids, so intramuscular injections must be used.\n2. Other treatment\nDepending on the specific case, the doctor will have a different regimen for each patient. However, patients need to pay attention to:\nPatients should remember to take the medicine regularly. If they stop taking the medicine, they will easily fall into acute adrenal failure, which is life-threatening.; Patients must know how to adjust the dose in situations, for example, when the body is under stress such as illness, diarrhea, infection... At the same time, increase the dose according to the doctor's instructions.; Regular check-ups for doctors to adjust dosage and screen for complications related to side effects of long-term corticosteroid use (can cause osteoporosis, diabetes)...\n3. Other serious injury or condition\nIf there is severe injury (unconsciousness, coma), people with adrenal insufficiency need higher doses of corticosteroids. Usually, your doctor will inject corticosteroids into your veins. As you recover, your doctor will adjust your dose back to normal, pre-injury levels.\nPatients with adrenal insufficiency are treated with hormone medications to replace the hormones that the adrenal glands cannot produce.\n\nIs adrenal insufficiency dangerous?\nAdrenal failure is very dangerous. If not treated promptly, the patient will develop acute adrenal insufficiency with symptoms: shock, convulsions, coma, and even death. Therefore, detecting adrenal insufficiency early plays a very important role, helping patients receive timely treatment, maintain health, and improve quality of life.\n>>>See more: How to effectively care for patients with adrenal insufficiency\n\nHow to prevent?\nAdrenal insufficiency greatly affects health. From the causes of adrenal insufficiency, people as well as patients need to pay attention to the following issues to prevent the disease.\nThe arbitrary use of corticosteroids, especially in people with bone and joint diseases, is the main cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency. Therefore, no matter what disease you have, without a doctor's prescription, people should not arbitrarily use drugs or drugs containing corticosteroids.; In case of conditions that require long-term use of corticosteroids, the patient needs to have regular medical examinations according to the doctor's appointment or whenever the body shows unusual symptoms to adjust the medication and treatment regimen. suitable treatment.; In case the patient has adrenal insufficiency, acute adrenal insufficiency is very dangerous, threatening death if not treated promptly. Therefore, patients must use corticosteroids for life and must always carry reserve medication with them. When experiencing stress, you need to immediately notify your doctor to adjust the medication dose because at this time the body does not respond to oral corticosteroids.\nAdrenal insufficiency is common in Vietnam due to prolonged use of corticosteroids, often in patients with asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, patients should not arbitrarily use corticosteroids or when treating asthma or rheumatoid arthritis, they should see an Endocrinologist - Diabetic to control the condition and not let depression occur. adrenals.",
