Every year, about 10 million women face this disease. So why does blocked fallopian tubes cause infertility?

The fallopian tubes connect from the uterus to the ovaries, this is the way sperm swim up to fertilize the egg. The end of the fallopian tube has the fallopian tube, which is structured like arms to help catch the egg when there is \"ovulation\", this egg will be moved in the fallopian tube to the appropriate position, and when it meets sperm. In the fallopian tube, fertilization can occur.\n After the egg and sperm are fertilized, the cilia in the fallopian tube mucosa have the function of supporting and transporting the fertilized zygote to the uterine cavity, starting the embryo's magical journey to implantation. period of creation.\n The fallopian tubes play an important role in conception because this is where most eggs are fertilized. If the fallopian tubes are damaged or encounter problems such as inflammation, scarring, fluid retention, etc., it will cause blockage of the fallopian tubes, seriously affecting the fertilization and pregnancy process of women.\n\nWhat is fallopian tube blockage?\nFallopian tube blockage or fallopian tube blockage is a factor that accounts for 25 - 30% of all cases of infertility in women. This is a condition in which the fallopian tubes are narrowed, preventing eggs and sperm from meeting to fertilize; or the fertilized zygote cannot move into the uterine cavity to \"implant\". Therefore, it can lead to the embryo implanting right in the fallopian tube, causing a very dangerous ectopic pregnancy. (first)\nAt IVFTA, there are many cases of people coming to the clinic with blocked fallopian tubes who have been waiting for a child for many years, typically the case of Ms. Pham Thi Thuy Be who spent 13 years tirelessly looking for a child.\n13 years of wanting a child, 9 years of pursuing fertility treatments from the South to the North were a nightmare caused by this disease for Ms. Pham Thi Thuy Be. It seemed like her opportunity to become a mother was blocked by this disease, but a miracle came to her family after being treated at Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi.\nThrough treatment, examination and implementation according to the hospital's protocol and with the experience of Associate Professor, Dr. Le Hoang - Director of the fertility support center of Tam Anh General Hospital (Hanoi), for the first time She received boundless happiness after 13 years of wanting a child. A handsome baby boy was born to the joy of his family. Ms. Thuy Be's story has inspired hundreds of unlucky women with problems with blocked fallopian tubes, don't give up, keep hoping, find the right teacher, the right place for treatment, the journey to motherhood continues. The door is wide open to welcome.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of fallopian tube blockage?\nBlocked fallopian tubes often do not cause special symptoms, so many people are unaware or easily confused with other gynecological infections. This is discovered when they have difficulty conceiving and is checked by X-ray of the uterus and fallopian tubes. (2)\nIn some cases, fallopian tube blockage can cause some pain in the abdomen, similar to the pain that occurs during menstruation, but the severity will depend on each individual's medical condition. People.\nIn addition, people with blocked fallopian tubes may experience problems such as irregular menstrual cycles, longer and heavier menstrual periods, accompanied by frequent urination and urgent urination, which makes women I feel tired and inconvenient in daily activities.\nReference: Does blocked fallopian tubes cause menstruation?\n\nCauses of fallopian tube blockage\nAccording to some statistics, a high proportion of women of reproductive age cannot become pregnant due to fallopian tube blockage. Because of the unclear symptoms of the disease, many women are confused as to why their fallopian tubes are blocked. (3)\nAccording to research, blocked fallopian tubes are often caused by the following factors:\nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID): According to statistics, 1 in 8 women with a history of PID will have difficulty conceiving. This disease forms scar tissue both inside and outside the fallopian tubes, or causes ovarian fluid retention (Hydrosalpinx) to form obstructions, hindering the process of transporting fertilized eggs to the uterus.\nEndometriosis: Endometrial cells grow outside a woman's uterus. These cells damage the fallopian tubes and fallopian tubes, leading to obstruction of fallopian tube motility and disrupting ovulation.\nSome sexually transmitted diseases: Chlamydia and gonorrhea are two common sexually transmitted diseases that can cause infertility in women. Both of the above bacteria can cause infection in the urethra and cervicitis. If not treated, it will lead to damage and scarring of the fallopian tubes.\nHistory of ectopic pregnancy: Ectopic pregnancy is dangerous for women during pregnancy, which requires surgical intervention to ensure safety for pregnant women, but there are potential risks. muscle causes scarring in the fallopian tubes.\nIn addition, fallopian tube blockage can also be due to congenital or sequelae after abdominal surgery, especially surgery on the fallopian tubes or the development of uterine fibroids... To minimize For the causes of fallopian tube blockage, you should have a safe sex life and apply primary prevention measures to avoid gynecological infections that cause fallopian tube blockage.\nIn addition, keeping the private area clean is also very important for women. This helps women prevent gynecological infections, blocked fallopian tubes, and improve their reproductive health.\n\nHow to diagnose fallopian tube blockage?\nCurrently, to determine whether a patient has a problem with fallopian tube blockage or not, the doctor will perform one of the following two diagnoses: (4)\nHysterosalpingogram (HSG): This is an imaging test prescribed by the doctor to check the condition of the inside of the uterus and fallopian tubes. To perform this technique, a speculum is used to open the vagina, then a catheter is inserted to pump fluid (containing dye) through your cervix into the uterus. The dye in the fluid helps the doctor see more clearly inside the fallopian tubes on an X-ray. The flow of fluid from the ends of one or both fallopian tubes can determine whether one or both tubes are open. If the fallopian tubes are not blocked, the fluid will slowly flow out of the end of the tube and be absorbed by the body. If the fluid does not penetrate or flow completely through one or both fallopian tubes, it indicates that the fallopian tubes are affected, also known as fallopian tube obstruction.; Laparoscopy: In this minimally invasive outpatient procedure, a surgical instrument called a laparoscope is inserted through a very small incision below the navel. The surgeon can look through the endoscope to see if one or both tubes are clear. Laparoscopy can also be used to look for other problems that can affect fertility, such as scar tissue (adhesions) or endometriosis. However, doctors do not recommend early diagnosis using this exploration technique because it is invasive and difficult to treat.\n\nIs fallopian tube blockage dangerous?\nFallopian tube blockage, if not treated effectively, will cause dangerous complications such as:\nInfertility: This is considered the most serious consequence if fallopian tube blockage is not treated effectively. This condition leads to complete blockage of the fallopian tubes, making it impossible for eggs and sperm to meet to fertilize.; Ectopic pregnancy: When the fallopian tube is narrowed, the egg, after being fertilized with sperm, cannot return to the uterus to nest but instead nests right in the wall of the fallopian tube, leading to an ectopic pregnancy. uterus. When the fetus grows large, it will cause pain and rupture of the fallopian tube. If not detected promptly, it can affect the mother's life.; Lower abdominal pain: Blocked fallopian tubes due to inflammation can cause pelvic and peritoneal infections, which can lead to severe lower abdominal pain.\n\nCan fallopian tube blockage be cured?\nCurrently, the rate of fallopian tube blockage in women of reproductive age is increasing. This is what slows down the growth of children and prevents women from reaching the happiness of motherhood. However, that is not the end of a woman's journey to motherhood.\nBut with outstanding advances in the country's medical industry, fallopian tube blockage can be treated completely, just go to the right reputable medical facility, and closely follow the doctor's instructions.\nInternal medicine: For cases where the fallopian tubes are slightly blocked due to inflammation, the doctor can treat them with antibiotics to help relieve inflammation and unblock the clogged area.\nSurgery: Applicable when home medication treatment is not effective for the patient. There are many ways to treat blocked fallopian tubes as follows:\nUsing air pump to unclog the fallopian tubes: This is a method applied in mild cases of fallopian tube blockage.; Laparoscopic fallopian tube surgery: This is a method of placing an endoscopic instrument into the uterine cavity, then inserting a specialized instrument into the fallopian tube to push and unblock the fallopian tube.; Fallopian tube cutting and joining surgery: Doctors will remove the blocked fallopian tubes that cannot be cleared, then reconnect them. If successful, the egg will move and be fertilized as normal.; Fallopian tube surgery: This is a method only used when unblocking measures are ineffective, the fallopian tubes and ovaries are too clogged, there is a lot of fluid, and there is no hope of being able to conceive naturally. . In this case, the doctor will prescribe IVF support and the mother can still get pregnant and give birth normally. In cases of severe fluid retention in the fallopian tubes, removing the fallopian tubes will also help increase the success rate of IVF.\n\nPrevent fallopian tube blockage\nMost fallopian tube blockages are caused by pelvic infections. These infections are often sexually transmitted diseases. Regularly screening for sexually transmitted diseases, as well as seeing a doctor when you have worrying symptoms, is an important step in preventing fallopian tube blockage and the dangerous complications that this condition causes. .\nEarly detection of sexually transmitted diseases will lead to effective treatment regimens, helping to prevent the formation of scar tissue. However, these diseases often progress silently and rarely have specific symptoms, so if women do not have the habit of regular gynecological examinations, it will be difficult to detect, leading to longer infections and the risk of scar tissue. The higher the inflammation and blockage of the tubes formed.\nWhen the disease is detected, the patient needs to comply with the doctor's treatment regimen, have scheduled follow-up examinations, and should also practice a healthy lifestyle, exercise, follow a healthy diet, and not smoke. , alcohol abuse...\nUse condoms and get tested for STDs regularly (especially if you engage in high-risk sexual behavior) to prevent fallopian tube damage from STDs.\nAssociate Professor, Dr. Le Hoang, Director of the Reproductive Support Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi directly examines, consults and treats cases of infertility.\nWith modern equipment in diagnosis and treatment, experienced experts, regularly updating new techniques, the Fertility Support Center of Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi (IVFTA) has successfully treated for thousands of infertile families such as: women with blocked fallopian tubes, low ovarian reserve (amh), thin mucous membranes...; Men with no sperm, weak sperm, deformed sperm...  with the highest average success rate in the country, up to 60.9%, in many cases of older women and patients with medical conditions. attach. Particularly for patients over 35 years old, the IVF success rate at IVFTA is up to 61.8% and 70% for patients under 30 years old.\nTo schedule an examination and consultation at the Reproductive Support Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, please contact:\nCurrently, with the development of modern medicine, many methods of treating blocked fallopian tubes have been developed and are highly effective in treating the disease. If you suspect you have signs of this condition, please see a doctor early to be examined by a doctor and receive treatment instructions.",
