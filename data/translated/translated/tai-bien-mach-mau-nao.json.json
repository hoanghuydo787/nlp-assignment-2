    "content": "Stroke: Causes, symptoms and diagnosis\n\nA cerebrovascular accident, also known as a stroke, occurs when the blood supply to the brain is blocked. This is considered one of the most dangerous diseases, with a high risk of death if not recognized early\nstroke symptoms\n and intervene promptly.\n  Percentage of people affected\nStroke\n (stroke) is tending to rejuvenate. According to information from the American Stroke Organization, about 15% of stroke patients are between the ages of 18 and 45 years old. In Vietnam, the proportion of young people with\nStroke\n accounts for about 25% of strokes. So\ncause of cerebrovascular accident\n What is it and why is this disease getting younger and younger?\nSigns of accident\n good\nstroke symptoms\n What happens and can the disease be screened? (first)\n\nWhat is a stroke?\nStroke is considered the second highest risk factor for death in Vietnam and among the top 10 in the world, according to WHO annual statistics. The disease becomes a dangerous threat to human health and life.\nA stroke is a condition in which the brain's blood vessels (arteries, capillaries or veins) are suddenly blocked or ruptured without a traumatic brain injury.\nWhen capillaries burst and become clogged, brain cells will lack oxygen and nutrients and begin to die. The longer the time goes on, the more brain cells die, causing the patient to suffer serious damage, even causing death. If they are lucky enough to be saved, the patient is likely to experience serious complications such as paralysis of the limbs, hemiplegia, inability to communicate, etc.\nThere are many ways to classify strokes. Among them, the most common way is divided into 2 groups: Stroke due to cerebral ischemia and stroke due to cerebral hemorrhage. (2)\nIschemic\nAbout 80% of strokes are due to ischemia in the brain. As a result, blood flow to the brain is reduced or blocked, causing not enough blood to feed brain cells, causing brain cells to die. Within 4 hours from the time the patient has the first symptoms of stroke, if not treated promptly, it will lead to death.\nBrain hemorrhage\nThe second type of stroke is cerebral hemorrhage, with a rate of 20% of the total number of cases. Cerebral hemorrhage is a condition in which blood spills into brain tissue, causing brain swelling and increased pressure in tissues around the brain. At this time, brain cells will gradually die and cause brain circuit rupture.\nIn just a few minutes, a patient with a stroke due to brain hemorrhage can die, requiring quick and timely emergency treatment. Therefore, the death rate of patients from brain hemorrhage is often much higher than in other cases.\nThere are two types of stroke: stroke due to cerebral infarction and cerebral hemorrhage\n\nStages of stroke\nStroke is divided into 3 main stages of progression, including:\nInitiation phase\nThis is the first stage of the disease, with no serious or characteristic symptoms yet, making it easy to confuse it with other diseases or ignore the signs of the disease.\nDecision phase\nAfter the initial stage, stroke will move to a more severe stage. If intervention is performed at this stage, the patient will still be able to survive, but there will be serious complications such as vegetative disorders, coma, hemiplegia, etc.\nProgressive stage\nThe progressive stage is the final stage of a person having a stroke, and is also the most dangerous stage. If this stage is skipped, the person having a stroke will have a very high risk of death. Emergency cases and interventions during this period are also more difficult and the success rate is lower.\n\nSigns of accident\nHow to recognize early that a person has a stroke? The sooner you recognize the signs of stroke and intervene, the more effective the intervention will be, with fewer complications. Accordingly, symptoms of stroke from mild to severe include: (3)\nHeadache, dizziness, discomfort and fatigue; Distortion of one side of the mouth or face; Tinnitus, decreased vision, blurred vision and inability to see clearly; Speech disorder, not knowing what to say, difficulty speaking and pronouncing words clearly; Numbness in limbs, inability to move or lift arms above head; Overbalance; Fast heartbeat; High fever, deep coma\n\nCause of cerebrovascular accident\nThe cause of a stroke will often vary depending on the type of stroke the patient has. Specifically:\nAccident or ischemic stroke\nPeople with ischemic stroke often have blood clots blocking the flow of blood and oxygen to brain cells. The cause of this condition is due to fatty deposits forming in plaques, located in the arteries and blocking the flow of blood. This condition is called atherosclerosis. Therefore, it can be said that atherosclerosis is the main cause of ischemic stroke.\nIn addition, age is also a risk factor for stroke. Our arteries tend to become narrower as we age, making our risk of lack of blood flow to the brain higher.\nStroke due to cerebral hemorrhage\nThe main cause of stroke due to cerebral hemorrhage is high blood pressure, which causes blood vessels in the skull to burst and bleed into the surrounding brain.\nA stroke can be caused by blood vessel blockage or brain bleeding\n\nRisk of cerebrovascular accident\nPeople who are susceptible to stroke or at high risk of stroke often belong to the following groups: (4)\nOverweight, obesity; Addicted to tobacco, regularly smoking; Drinking too much wine, beer and alcoholic beverages; Lack of movement and exercise; Often worried, stressed, suffering from long-term anxiety disorders; High blood pressure (hypertension); Have diabetes or cardiovascular disease; Eat foods high in fat and grease; Men and women entering middle age; Family history of someone having had a stroke\n\nTreatment of cerebrovascular accident\nThe general principle for treating stroke/stroke is early emergency treatment and accurate intervention, to limit complications as well as minimize the risk of death. When you see someone with mild or severe stroke symptoms, immediately call an ambulance and help take the patient to the hospital. In addition, it is also important to keep the patient from falling and place the patient on their side to protect the airway.\nBefore and while taking the patient to the emergency room, absolutely do not give the patient anything to eat or drink and do not arbitrarily treat with measures such as acupuncture, acupressure, wind blowing, etc. You should also not give drink to a person having a stroke. blood pressure medication or other medications that only monitor the patient's symptoms to see if they vomit, have convulsions, distort their mouth, etc.\nWhen arriving at the hospital, doctors will diagnose whether the patient has had a stroke or not. According to the World Health Organization, to determine a stroke, the following 3 clinical criteria are needed:\nThere are focal neurological symptoms; Symptoms come on suddenly; There was no traumatic brain injury\nIf all three of the above criteria are met, the patient's chance of having a stroke is up to 95-99%. At this time, the doctor can conduct a computed tomography brain scan or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain to determine whether the cause of the stroke is due to blood vessel blockage or brain hemorrhage and have appropriate intervention methods. to limit the spread of damage.\nTimely treatment of stroke not only helps save patients' lives and limit complications, but is also based on the principle of helping patients recover as quickly as possible and preventing the risk of stroke recurrence.\nPeople with stroke symptoms should be taken to the hospital as soon as possible\n\nSequelae of cerebrovascular accident\nComplications after a stroke can vary depending on many factors such as the cause of the stroke, whether the patient receives timely treatment, whether the treatment method is suitable for the cause of the stroke, etc. The sooner emergency treatment is provided, the more dangerous complications will be avoided.\nSome common stroke complications include: (5)\nCerebral edema; Epileptic; Deep vein thrombosis; Paralysis of one arm, leg or both; Loss of mobility; Swallowing disorders; Collapsed lung; Pneumonia; Heart attack; Shoulder pain; Urinary tract infections; Muscle cramps; Excessive anxiety and stress; Sleep disorders; Depression; …\nUsually, it takes at least 30 days for a person with a stroke to recover. However, there are also cases where stroke complications are permanent and can only be intervened to alleviate the complications, and cannot be completely recovered.\n\nCaring for stroke patients\nHow to care for stroke patients also depends on the complications the patient experiences after treatment. When taking care of patients, some issues should be kept in mind such as:\nSupport patients to change positions regularly (30 minutes/time) for patients who cannot move, are paralyzed on half or the whole body;; Regularly clean private areas to avoid urinary tract infections;; Provides a complete diet of nutrients; Feed the patient thin foods and eat slowly to avoid choking, leading to aspiration pneumonia;; Keep the patient's bedroom clean, airy, and quiet, helping the patient rest better;; Follow the treatment regimen from your doctor;; People with stroke who experience muscle stiffness and hemiplegia after treatment can practice physical therapy, acupuncture, massage, etc. to increase recovery rate;; Regularly talk and reassure the patient because people who have had a stroke are susceptible to psychological trauma and anxiety disorders, fearing a recurrent stroke leading to death. You should be patient with the patient and limit expressing unpleasant or discriminatory attitudes.\nBe patient in caring for people with stroke\n\nPrevent\nWhat should be done to prevent stroke? Accordingly, you should maintain a healthy lifestyle:\nEat enough meals and have a nutritious diet. Limit foods high in oil, fat, cholesterol, etc. Instead, eat vegetables, seafood, eggs, beans, white meat, cereals, etc.;; Do not use alcohol, alcoholic beverages and stimulants;; Regularly exercise, at least 30 minutes/day, 3-4 days a week;; Stabilize weight, avoid overweight and obesity;; Avoid high blood pressure;; Avoid stressors;; Limit staying up late, ensure sleep quality;; Regular health check-ups and stroke screening.\n\nNutrition\nWith nutrition for people after stroke, it is important to note:\nMinimize sodium content, don't eat too salty foods;; Limit eating too much, feeling too full causes high fat absorption, increasing the risk of obesity;; Eat lots of green vegetables and fruits;; Diverse groups of nutrients;; Add low-fat protein and cut down on saturated fat and trans fat.\nYou should limit foods rich in cholesterol to ensure your health after a stroke\n\nFrequently asked questions about stroke\nCan stroke cause sex?\nWhen there are signs of a stroke, the patient needs emergency treatment as soon as possible. While waiting for emergency treatment, the patient should just lie still and avoid any activities.\nIs stroke dangerous?\nThe answer is yes. If a person with a stroke does not receive timely emergency treatment, he or she will experience many serious complications and may become paralyzed or even lead a vegetative state.\nAnd stroke is also the disease with the second highest risk of death worldwide. Many cases of stroke lead to death when there is no early intervention during the \"golden time\".\nShould a stroke require acupuncture?\nIf you have symptoms of complications, you should not self-treat with acupuncture to avoid possible complications that can negatively affect the patient's health and life. It is best to take people with signs of stroke to the hospital for treatment by a qualified doctor.\nPeople being treated for stroke, if there are complications such as numb limbs, difficulty moving, difficulty walking, etc., can apply acupuncture to speed up recovery, helping the patient return soon. normal life.\nAcupuncture can help treat muscle stiffness in people after a stroke. It is not used to treat strokes\nIs a stroke a stroke?\nStroke is a term commonly used in medicine. In folk medicine, a stroke is called a \"stroke\". Therefore, a stroke is a stroke.\nWhere is a stroke diagnosed and treated?\nThe Neurology Center, Tam Anh General Hospital System is currently implementing emergency intervention services for people with stroke during golden hours. At the same time, the Center also has stroke screening packages from basic to advanced, expanded, helping to screen and early detect risk factors leading to strokes, preventing bad cases that can occur. can happen.\nWith the advantage of a team of experienced, skilled doctors as well as investment in the world's leading modern machinery system, the Neurological Center, Tam Anh General Hospital System is currently one of the leading units in the world.
