    "content": "Early repolarization: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment\n\nMore and more young people are being diagnosed with early repolarization. The patient is not at risk of developing life-threatening arrhythmias. On the contrary, patients need early intervention and treatment to prevent the risk of death.\n\nOverview of early repolarization\nThe heart muscle operates thanks to electrical signals that generate rhythm and conduct impulses to help the heart muscle contract and pump blood to nourish the body's organs. The heart's electrical activity is simply divided into two phases: depolarization (heart contracts) and repolarization (heart rests after contraction). When the heart's electrical system is not working as it should, premature repolarization can occur. Early repolarization can be detected by suggestive images on the electrocardiogram (ECG), which are small notch-shaped waves that follow the end of a normal ventricular depolarization wave.\n\nEarly repolarization electrocardiogram\nIn the past, premature repolarization was commonly observed in healthy young people and athletes. Therefore, it was once considered benign and not a medical condition. However, recent studies have shown that repolarization disease can progress to dangerous arrhythmias that are life-threatening.\n\nSymptoms of early repolarization in the heart\nMost patients with early repolarization do not have any noticeable symptoms. The disease is often discovered accidentally through electrocardiography during a general examination. Patients with early repolarization often have low baseline heart rates.\nSome patients with premature repolarization may experience severe arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation).\nAt this time, the patient appears to have symptoms of fainting, near fainting, and bouts of dizziness. These are the first warning signs and suggestive of serious illness. Therefore, it is important to see a doctor immediately when these symptoms appear.\n\nCauses and risk factors\nEarly repolarization has the potential to occur in any patient and at any age. However, the disease is common in the following groups of people:\nYoung people; Male; African American; Athlete\n\nDiagnose\nEarly repolarization is often diagnosed incidentally based on an electrocardiogram (ECG) when a patient comes in for other health problems. If signs suggestive of abnormalities are seen on the electrocardiogram, the doctor will conduct a thorough medical history and symptoms related to arrhythmia. The doctor will also do a clinical examination and give some paraclinical indications such as echocardiography, Holter ECG, exercise ECG, cardiac MRI, genetic testing... This helps diagnose the disease as well as differentiate between different diseases. Pathologies that cause similar symptoms.\nEcg measurement image\nDoctors specializing in arrhythmias can conduct surveys and probe the electrical activity in the patient's heart, helping to stratify the patient's risk to provide appropriate monitoring and treatment.\n\nEarly repolarization treatment\nIf a patient is assessed by an arrhythmia specialist to be at no risk or low risk, the patient usually does not need any specific treatment. If a patient is stratified as high risk, that patient needs specific treatment, which includes:\nImplantation of a defibrillator (ICD) under the skin. This method is often used, the machine is implanted in the chest near the heart to control abnormal electrical impulses.; Use medicine. Some medications work to reduce abnormal electrical activity in the heart that causes arrhythmias.; Arrhythmia ablation using radiofrequency waves. In some cases, the procedure is highly effective in eliminating or reducing electrically abnormal areas in the heart.; The choice of method depends on each patient's unique situation.\nA place to receive and treat patients with early repolarization as well as cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, myocardial ischemia...), Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital System Gathering a team of experts who are leading doctors in the industry, equipped with advanced machinery systems. Treatment regimens are individualized for each patient, highly effective in improving symptoms and preventing dangerous complications of the disease.\nThe rate of early repolarization in the general population ranges from 5% to 15%; The wide range reflects differences in definition as well as variation in patterns of early repolarization over time.",
