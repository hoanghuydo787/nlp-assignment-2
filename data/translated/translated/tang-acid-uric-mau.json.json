    "content": "Hyperuricemia: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment\n\nHyperuricemia is a typical warning sign of gout and kidney diseases. High uric acid in the blood can be due to the patient's body condition or food. High uric acid is common in people with unhealthy living habits and unscientific diets.\n\nWhat is hyperuricemia?\nHyperuricemia is a condition in which the uric acid index in the blood is abnormally high, occurring when the body decomposes excessive purines or fails to eliminate uric acid from the body. Increased uric acid is an alarming health condition that can lead to permanent bone and joint damage, tophi deposits under the skin, as well as increase the risk of heart and kidney disease. (first)\nUric acid is a metabolite found in the blood, a product of purine metabolism in the human body and is eliminated mainly from the kidneys (80%) and partly through the intestines (20%). Uric acid levels in the blood will also increase or decrease depending on the diet. Uric acid levels will increase when consuming large amounts of purines in the body such as red meat, shellfish, alcohol, etc.\nIn addition, blood uric acid levels also increase in cases of kidney damage such as kidney failure, reducing uric acid excretion from the body. Genetic mutations that affect purine metabolism and uric acid excretion also cause this condition.\nIncreasing blood uric acid above the saturation threshold of uric acid will cause deposition of MSU (monosodium urate) crystals in tissues such as joint tissue, subcutaneous tissue, kidney tubules, blood vessels... Gout is a manifestation of increased uric acid. lengthen. Deposition and formation of MSU crystals can lead to arthritis with symptoms such as swelling, heat, redness, and pain in the joints. In addition, deposition in the kidneys can form kidney stones.\n\nHow much uric acid index is high?\nAccording to medical experts from Medical News Today, normal uric acid levels in humans range from 1.5-7 mg/dl. The amount of uric acid in the male body will be about 1 mg/dl higher than in women. Therefore, a person has hyperuricemia when the concentration of this compound is higher than 7 mg/dl for men and 6 mg/dl for women. (2)\n\nCauses of increased blood uric acid\nThe cause of high uric acid mainly comes from purine content in the body that is higher than necessary.\nIn addition, factors such as genetics, environment, diet and living habits are reasons that can affect the increase or decrease of uric acid in the human body.\nRisk factors for hyperacidity include:\nMetabolic syndrome; Abusing or using alcohol regularly; People with a history of hypertension; People with diabetes; People eat uncontrollably purine-rich foods such as red meat, shellfish, etc.; People using loop diuretics and thiazides.\n\nSymptoms of hyperuricemia and gout\nSymptoms of increased uric acid in the blood are often seen as symptoms of gout and kidney stones. However, in the early stages, high uric acid will have no specific clinical signs to recognize. Symptoms only appear when the condition has persisted for a while without appropriate treatment, and the severity of the disease also becomes more serious. (3)\nCommon symptoms of gout include:\nSwelling, heat, redness, joint pain; Limited movement of joints, patients have difficulty walking.; Joint stiffness and joint deformity when the disease lasts; Tophi appear under the skin\nSymptoms of kidney stones include abdominal cramps, blood in the urine, and urinary disorders such as frequent urination, cloudy urine, strong odor or blood.\n\nDiagnose\nDiagnosis of increased uric acid is mainly based on blood tests. In addition, urine tests also contribute to supporting diagnosis and finding the cause of uric acid blockage in the blood. Blood and urine test results will show the following indicators:\nUric acid concentration; Uric acid concentration in urine; Look for MSU crystals in urine.\nReference: Necessary gout tests to diagnose the disease\nIt should be noted that aids in diagnosing gout may require the use of ultrasound, x-rays of painful swollen areas or joint puncture to look for MSU crystals.\n\nIs hyperuricemia dangerous?\nIncreased uric acid is an alarming health condition for patients. This condition is the cause of musculoskeletal diseases, especially gout, kidney damage causing kidney stones and kidney failure, cardiovascular damage causing hypertension... In addition, long-term increased uric acid will also increase the risk of diseases such as metabolic disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease.\nWhen a person has abnormally high acid levels, the most important thing is to change and maintain appropriate nutrition. Therefore, patients with high blood acid levels and gout need to comply and be proactive in protecting their own health, especially those who are older, have many underlying diseases, and are easily affected. more than other target groups.\n\nSubjects at risk of high uric acid\nAnyone can have high blood uric acid, but studies show that men are more likely to have high uric acid in the blood than women. This may be related to the nature of work and living habits of most men, which are at risk of increasing uric acid in the blood.\nTypical factors include heavy alcohol use and heavy physical activity. In addition, some diseases can also contribute to this condition such as kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, hypothyroidism, obesity, and use of drugs to treat cardiovascular disease.\n\nHow to treat hyperuricemia?\nTreatment of hyperuricemia is mainly to adjust the diet and reduce the animal purine content in meals. In case the patient has symptoms of gout, the doctor will prescribe medication to control these symptoms, and use uric acid-lowering medications when indicated. (4)\nReference: What should you avoid eating with high uric acid?\nFor cases where the patient does not have any symptoms and has no signs of affecting the bones, joints or kidneys due to increased uric acid in the blood, there is no need to use medication to lower uric acid in the blood. For those who have symptoms and are diagnosed with gout, the doctor will initiate specific treatment along with changing the diet appropriate to their health condition. Medications used for people with gout include anti-inflammatory drugs that treat symptoms of joint swelling and pain such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine or corticosteroids.\nHowever, these drugs should only be used to reduce joint swelling and pain and in the early stages to prevent acute gout attacks. After a few months, discontinue use. Meanwhile, drugs used to lower blood uric acid levels include allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid, which are used for a long time to maintain blood uric acid levels below the necessary threshold for a long time to prevent the formation of blood uric acid. MSU crystals, causing joint damage.\nIn addition, if the patient has large tophi due to prolonged uric acid deposition, it can cause joint stiffness, seriously affecting joint movement, and the patient may need surgery to remove it.\nFor people with kidney failure or kidney stones due to high uric acid, the doctor will treat the patient's kidney stones first. Methods of use may include taking painkillers, stone crushing or surgical removal. This depends on the size of the patient's stones. Combined with a suitable diet for people with kidney disease caused by uric acid to promote the process of improving kidney function and balancing uric acid levels.\nNutritional notes for people with increased uric acid include:\nDo not eat animal organs; Limit shellfish such as shrimp, crab...; Limit red meat such as beef, goat meat, lamb...; Do not drink alcohol and foods containing caffeine, do not smoke; Prioritize protein absorption from plants; Eat more vegetables; Drink a lot of water\n\nMethods to prevent increased uric acid in the blood\nThe most effective method of preventing increased uric acid in the blood comes from comprehensive health care. Because the direct cause of high uric acid has not been determined, prevention will focus on adjusting a healthy, nutritious diet. Make sure not to absorb too much purine to cause metabolic disorders. Early recognition of gout conditions and kidney disease also contributes to reducing the treatment burden in patients with hyperuricemia.\nIt should be noted that it is not necessary to cut any foods out of the diet if there are no other medical problems or allergies. A scientific, appropriate nutritional diet is one that controls the amount of substances that you absorb into your body every day. Foods that need to carefully control their intake to avoid high uric acid include:\nSweet fruits, high in fructose; Animal organs; Red meat; Shellfish; Acoholic drink\nCenter for Orthopedic Trauma, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is where a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons gather such as: TTND.Prof.Dr.Nguyen Viet Tien; Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa; Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh; MSc.BS.CKII Tran Anh Vu; BS.CKI Tran Xuan Anh, MSc.CKI Le Dinh Khoa, MSc.BS Nguyen Quang Ton Quyen; Dr. Do Tien Dung; PhD.BS.CKII Vu Huu Dungâ€¦\nThis is also one of the pioneer units in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal diseases with modern techniques according to updated international protocols.\nThe hospital is also equipped with modern machinery and imaging equipment such as: Somatom Drive 768-slice CT scanner, new generation Magnetom Amira BioMatrix magnetic resonance machine, Artis Pheno robot, densitometer. bones, ultrasound machines...; Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss surgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table... to be able to detect injuries early and effectively treat musculoskeletal diseases...\nTam Anh General Hospital also owns a spacious clinic system and high-class boarding area; modern rehabilitation area; Comprehensive post-operative care process helps patients quickly recover and stabilize their health after surgery.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Orthopedics Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nHyperuricemiaÂ is an alarming health condition that can quickly lead to serious diseases such as gout, kidney failure, kidney stones, cardiovascular disease, and joint and tissue damage in the body.
