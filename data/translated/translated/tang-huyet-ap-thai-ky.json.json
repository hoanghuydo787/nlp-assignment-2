Hypertension during pregnancy, if not detected early and promptly intervened, can lead to preeclampsia, eclampsia, and the fetus is at risk of stillbirth or premature birth. So what should pregnant women pay attention to to prevent high blood pressure during pregnancy? Blood pressure is the pressure of blood flow on the artery walls to bring blood to nourish the body's tissues. Blood pressure is created by the force of contraction of the heart and the resistance of the arteries. Blood pressure is expressed by two indexes: maximum blood pressure (also called systolic blood pressure or the top number), normally 90-139 mmHg, and minimum blood pressure (also called diastolic blood pressure or top number). lower index), normal is 60-89 mmHg. (first)\n According to the recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology and the Vietnam Heart Association, hypertension is systolic blood pressure\n≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg, meaning normal blood pressure must be less than 140/90 mmHg.\n\nWhat is gestational hypertension?\nPregnancy-Induced Hypertension is a phenomenon of increased blood pressure that appears after the 20th week of pregnancy and returns to normal levels 6 weeks after giving birth. Mild high blood pressure during pregnancy is about 140-159/90-109 mmHg, severe when it is ≥160/100 mmHg. (2)\nThe disease usually occurs in 5-10% of pregnant women\nSymptoms of high blood pressure during pregnancy include:\nChronic hypertension: Appears before pregnancy or at 20 weeks of pregnancy. This condition can last more than 42 days after birth, possibly related to proteinuria.; Gestational hypertension: Appears after the 20th week of pregnancy. This condition will return to normal within 42 days after birth, but can progress to chronic hypertension if blood pressure continues to increase thereafter.; Preeclampsia: This is a clinical form that appears when a pregnant woman has her first pregnancy, a multiple pregnancy, a molar pregnancy or a pregnant woman with phospholipid syndrome, especially when the pregnant woman has chronic hypertension, kidney disease or diabetes. Preeclampsia is diagnosed based on proteinuria test results and systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg. This condition often appears at 20 weeks in pregnant women with previously normal blood pressure, and is related to fetal growth retardation due to placental insufficiency. This is also the cause of premature birth.; Preeclampsia on the basis of chronic hypertension: This condition will have a high probability of occurring when a pregnant woman with high blood pressure has proteinuria for the first time.\n\nCauses of high blood pressure in pregnant women\nThe disease can stem from some of the following main causes: (3)\nNutrition during pregnancy is not scientific, pregnant women eat too much salt;; Pregnant women are not physically active and do not nourish their fetus properly;; Sudden weather changes, too hot or too cold;; Pregnant women over 35 years old;; Pregnant women have diabetes or related diseases leading to complications of high blood pressure during pregnancy.\nGestational diabetes is one of the diseases that leads to high blood pressure in pregnant women\n\nRecognize symptoms of high blood pressure during pregnancy\nAccording to MSc. Dinh Thi Hien Le, depending on each pregnant woman's condition, the disease may have different symptoms, however there are cases where pregnant women do not have any signs. Usually signs of high blood pressure in pregnant women appear in the second half of pregnancy including:\nSwollen feet and hands;; Sudden weight gain;; Vision disorders (blurred vision, double vision, transient vision loss,...);; Nausea, vomiting;; Severe headache, epigastric pain, chest pain behind the sternum and difficulty breathing.\n\nDangerous complications of gestational hypertension\nIf the disease is not detected and treated promptly, it will be dangerous for both mother and baby\nIs high blood pressure during pregnancy dangerous? This phenomenon can negatively affect the health of both the pregnant woman and the fetus. The danger of the disease depends on the duration of pregnancy as well as the level of high blood pressure of the pregnant woman. The higher blood pressure during pregnancy and the earlier it appears, the greater the risk of the mother and fetus having dangerous complications. (4)\nFor pregnant women, high blood pressure during pregnancy can lead to complications such as:\nPre-eclampsia: Statistics show that 25% of pregnant women with high blood pressure are at risk of pre-eclampsia, 5-8% of eclampsia cases die.; Adverse effects on the health of pregnant women after giving birth, slow postpartum recovery; It is easy to experience high blood pressure in subsequent pregnancies.; There is a risk of related diseases such as cardiovascular, kidney...\nFor fetuses born to mothers with gestational hypertension syndrome:\nSlow development or stillbirth: The fetus does not receive enough oxygen and nutrients from the mother, causing the baby to develop slowly, not reaching the average weight according to standards, and in the worst case, it will lead to stillbirth while still in the womb. Mom.; Premature birth: Despite treatment, some cases of pregnant women with high blood pressure or eclampsia may need to give birth earlier to avoid negative effects on the health of mother and baby. Babies born prematurely and not healthy enough have a high risk of death.\n\nHow to treat gestational hypertension?\nIn many cases, termination of pregnancy is indicated at week 37\nTreatment of hypertension during pregnancy needs to be diagnosed and prescribed by a doctor on the basis of:\nThe pregnancy, overall health and medical history of the pregnant woman;; Severity of the disease;; The pregnant woman's tolerance to specific medications or surgical therapies;; Expectations of pregnant women and their families for the examination and treatment process.\nHowever, pregnant women and their families should note that they need treatment as soon as they notice:\nHigh blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg;; When systolic blood pressure is ≥170 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure is ≥110 mmHg, pregnant women need to be hospitalized immediately for emergency treatment to avoid unfortunate dangers;; Prioritized drugs used in the treatment of pregnancy blood pressure include methyldopa, labetalol... ACE inhibitors and receptor blockers are contraindicated because they can cause birth defects;; Pregnant women with mild hypertension or pre-eclampsia are recommended to terminate their pregnancy at 37 weeks.\n\nHow to prevent high blood pressure during pregnancy?\nMs. Dinh Thi Hien Le, MSc., said that if gestational hypertension is not detected early and treated promptly, it will lead to many dangerous complications for both mother and baby. To avoid unfortunate incidents, before planning pregnancy, women should pay attention to the following issues: (5)\nAvoid pregnancy and childbirth at an advanced age;; Overweight women need to have a weight loss plan before pregnancy;; Follow a healthy diet, eat lots of fruits, vegetables, etc. to reduce the risk of gestational diabetes. If you have diabetes, you need to control your blood sugar well before and during pregnancy;; Exercise in moderation before and during pregnancy according to your doctor's instructions. Pregnant women diagnosed with preeclampsia need gentle exercise and are not encouraged to lie in bed for long periods of time.\nWith the desire for pregnant women to receive comprehensive care during pregnancy, Tam Anh General Hospital deploys a comprehensive maternity service with outstanding high quality.
