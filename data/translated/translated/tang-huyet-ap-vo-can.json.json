    "content": "Primary essential hypertension: Causes, symptoms, treatment\n\nIf secondary hypertension occurs with a clear cause, essential hypertension is more difficult to detect, progresses silently and causes many unpredictable consequences.\nHypertension is a precursor to many cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction, heart failure...\n\nWhat is essential hypertension?\nEssential hypertension is high blood pressure of unknown cause, also known as primary hypertension. Blood pressure is the pressure of blood against the artery walls as the heart pumps blood throughout the body. High blood pressure occurs when the force of blood is stronger than normal.\nMost cases of high blood pressure are classified as essential hypertension, while other types of high blood pressure fall into the category of secondary hypertension (high blood pressure with an identifiable cause, such as injury). heart, eyes or kidneys causing high blood pressure). This high blood pressure condition can begin at any age, but is most common in middle age.\nSee more information about high blood pressure here.\n\nCauses of essential hypertension\nGenetics is considered the leading risk factor for primary hypertension. Besides, the risk of disease will increase if you:\nOverweight or obese; Have a sedentary lifestyle; Diet high in salt, low in potassium; Smoke; Drinking alcohol in excess (more than 1 drink/day for women and 2 drinks/day for men); Often uncontrollable stress\n\nCommon symptoms\nSymptoms of hypertension in general and essential hypertension in particular are very rare. People can have high blood pressure for many years without knowing that they have the disease. Some people don't discover they have high blood pressure until they experience a condition related to high blood pressure, such as a stroke or heart attack. That's why every person, especially those with risk factors for high blood pressure, must have their blood pressure checked regularly.\nSome people with essential high blood pressure may experience symptoms such as:\nHeadache due to high blood pressure; Epistaxis; Shortness of breath\n\nComplications of primary essential hypertension\nThe higher your blood pressure, the harder your heart has to work. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to:\nHeart failure; Heart attack; Atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries due to cholesterol buildup (cause of heart attacks); Eye damage; Kidney damage; Nerve damage\n\nDiagnostic method\nTo diagnose essential hypertension, your doctor will first check your blood pressure with a blood pressure monitor. If the reading is too high, your doctor may recommend that you check your blood pressure at home at certain intervals. You will be instructed on how to use the blood pressure monitor to get accurate results. The final index is determined by the average value of blood pressure measurements at different times.\nYou will be asked to self-monitor your blood pressure at home if you have signs of high blood pressure\nIn addition, your doctor will conduct a physical examination to check for signs of cardiovascular disease. At your visit, your doctor will check your eyes, listen to your heart, lungs, and blood flow in your neck. Small blood vessels under the eyes can be a sign of damage from high blood pressure, as can blood vessels elsewhere.\nFinally, your doctor may ask you to do the following laboratory tests to check your heart and kidneys:\nBlood tests check cholesterol levels;; Echocardiography;; Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG);; Blood tests, urine tests, or ultrasound to check kidney and other organ function.\n\nScreening for essential hypertension\nScreening for essential hypertension is an indispensable step, especially for people with one or more risk factors for high blood pressure. This helps control blood pressure, detect early if the reading is abnormally high to have an appropriate treatment regimen, and prevent complications.\nTo monitor your blood pressure, the best way is to measure your blood pressure regularly. Your blood pressure readings may fluctuate, with highs and lows within 24 hours. They change at every moment when you exercise, rest, when you are in pain and even when you are stressed or angry. Occasionally, a high blood pressure reading does not mean you have hypertension. You will not be diagnosed with high blood pressure unless you have high blood pressure readings at least 2-3 times at different times.\nSee more: Instructions on how to properly measure blood pressure at home\nAccording to the recommendations of the National Heart Association, hypertension is diagnosed when blood pressure measured in the clinic is â‰¥140/90 mmHg. Prehypertension is determined when the index is in the range of 120-139/80-89 mmHg. Optimal blood pressure level is <120/80 mmHg.\n\nTreatment and prevention\nThere is no way to completely cure this high blood pressure condition, but following a healthy lifestyle will help control symptoms as well as prevent the disease:\nChange your lifestyle\nIf you have essential hypertension, your doctor will recommend lifestyle changes to lower your blood pressure. You need:\nExercise regularly (at least 150 minutes/week). Exercises suitable for people with high blood pressure are walking, swimming, cycling, yoga...; Lose weight if you are overweight - obese, maintain BMI between 18.5 - 22.9.; Quit smoking, limit alcohol; Learn how to control stress.; Have a diet low in salt, rich in potassium and fiber, good for the heart. The ideal diet for hypertensive patients includes lots of vegetables, fruits, low-fat dairy products and whole grains, lean meats, and good fats. A good diet for people with high blood pressure also helps control weight and avoid overweight and obesity.; If you have kidney problems, don't eat too much potassium-rich foods without your doctor's permission.\nA low-salt, high-fiber diet helps control high blood pressure\nTake medicine regularly\nIf lifestyle changes don't stabilize your blood pressure, your doctor may prescribe one or more blood pressure medications. Commonly prescribed blood pressure medications are beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, renin inhibitors, etc.\nTam Anh General Hospital Cardiovascular Center effectively examines and screens for cardiovascular diseases including primary and secondary hypertension, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease... The center gathers A team of experienced doctors and modern machinery systems help detect high blood pressure early and provide timely treatment, reducing the risk of heart attack, stroke and heart failure.\nTo schedule an examination with experts at the Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, customers can contact:\nIf essential hypertension is screened, detected early and treated properly, dangerous complications can be prevented. People with risk factors need to have regular cardiovascular health checks and regular blood pressure measurements at home to detect early signs of hypertension.",
