    "content": "Numbness of limbs: Causes, symptoms, treatment and prevention\n\nNumbness of the limbs is a common symptom that can occur from young to old people. If this condition persists without treatment, it can lead to some unpredictable complications such as pain, muscle atrophy or paralysis,...\n\nWhat is the feeling of numbness?\nNumbness is essentially a condition of partial or complete sensory disorder or paresthesia in some locations on the body. This condition is often accompanied by an unusual sharp, pins-and-needles pain unrelated to sensory stimulation. In addition, patients may also feel pain, paralysis of limbs, etc. Usually numbness is related to dysfunction of peripheral nerves (1).\n\nLocation\n1. Hand numbness\nHand numbness is one of the most common phenomena. This feeling can occur due to nerve roots being affected, compressed or compressed at the peripheral location of the nerve, such as the elbow or wrist. are two very common positions. This phenomenon can occur after working, overworking or sitting still for too long. (2)\n2. Numbness in the legs\nNumbness of the feet has a slight numbness like pins and needles in the early stages, a tingling feeling that appears in the thighs, legs and from the buttocks to the legs, toes, both soles of the feet, there can be numbness in one leg or both. two legs.\n3. Numbness of the fingertips\nThe sensory nerves of the fingers are divided into nerve roots from the cervical spinal cord and when the nerves in these parts are damaged, inflamed, tumoured, or compressed in different locations...\n4. Numbness in the face\nFacial numbness is a condition in which the face loses the ability to express emotions due to nerve damage. Facial muscles may droop or weaken on one or both sides of the face. This condition can last for a short time or longer depending on the different causes.\n5. Numbness of the shoulder blades\nThis is a condition in which the shoulder blades become numb and may be accompanied by symptoms such as muscle stiffness and shoulder pain. The severity depends on the specific cause and is often a result of exercise, sleeping in the wrong position or can be a sign of other serious health problems.\n6. Numbness in the heels\nThe heel along with the whole foot plays a supporting role for the body. If not properly cared for and protected, it will be very vulnerable. This is a condition of pain and numbness in the heel, often caused by the pressure of moving, carrying heavy loads...\n5. Numbness all over the body\nSymptoms of numbness and pain are not only found in the limbs and head but can also occur in the whole body, causing pain and numbness in the migraines, at the tips of the fingers, and sometimes also feeling tingling under the skin. tingling sensations or pain along the ribs, or a cold feeling down the back, aching limbs, pain along the shoulders and neck.\n\nWhat is limb numbness?\nNumbness of Limb is the most common neurological syndrome, can be found in anyone, whether teenagers or the elderly, and has a significant impact on daily life. sick day.\n\nSubjects are susceptible to numbness in their hands and feet\n1. Elderly people\nThose at highest risk are the elderly, because in the elderly, bones and joints will age over time and become susceptible to damage. In addition, due to the nature of their work, people who work as long-distance drivers or office workers are exposed to computers for many consecutive hours, or people who often have to do heavy manual labor. Injured at work, exercising or having a traffic accident... are also susceptible to numbness in the hands and feet.\nElderly people are at high risk of experiencing numbness in their hands and feet\n2. Patients with metabolic disorders\nNot only that, metabolic disorders such as diabetes and high blood fat are also common causes of limb numbness. The reason is that in this group of diseases there is microvascular damage leading to a lack of blood supply and nourishment to the nerves. The initial manifestation may be simply a vascular spasm disorder, when the spasm leads to anemia causing numbness in the limbs.\nThese symptoms can be completely overcome if detected early and will help reduce or even eliminate numbness, but if not treated early and let the disease get worse, it will cause blood vessels to narrow and become clogged, leading to death. muscle atrophy, ulcers.\n3. Postpartum women\nPostpartum hand numbness is also a common phenomenon in women after giving birth, manifested by occasional numbness of the fingers, possibly accompanied by numbness, tingling or cramps. The pain can spread to areas such as the legs, buttocks, thighs, etc. and can even limit the ability to move if not treated early.\n\nThe cause to the illness\nThe National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) said: There are many causes of numbness in the left and right limbs accompanied by bone and joint pain, of which more than 75% of cases of numbness in the limbs are due to disease. following reason:\n1. Spinal degeneration\nOften occurring at night or when the weather changes, spinal degeneration causes joint cartilage and vertebrae to erode and rub against nerve roots, causing pain and numbness in the neck spreading to the arms or pain from the waist down. two legs.\n2. Disc herniation\nDisc herniation is a common cause of numbness in the arms and legs, often occurring in the cervical and lumbar discs. This condition occurs when the nucleus pulposus spills out of the fibrous disc and compresses the spinal nerves, thereby leading to numbness in the arms and legs, causing limited body movement.\n4. Osteoarthritis\nWhen the arm, knee or hip joints are worn out or damaged by negative factors, it will be difficult to move the arms and legs and lead to numbness in the arms and feet.\n5. Rheumatoid arthritis\nInflammation and damage to the hand and foot joints will also cause numbness in the hands and feet and often occurs after lying or sitting for too long in one position and is accompanied by muscle stiffness.\n6. Spinal stenosis\nThis is a congenital disease in which the spine is deformed and shrunk, causing the nerve roots passing through to be compressed, causing continuous and prolonged numbness in the limbs. If this condition is left for a long time, it will cause blockage of blood circulation and difficulty in movement.\n7. Multiple sclerosis\nProblems related to vision, numbness, itching, muscle weakness... are manifestations of multiple sclerosis. This disease has a direct impact on the central nervous system, causing damage to the Myelin membrane and leading to symptoms of numbness in the limbs.\n8. Polyradiculoneuritis\nThis condition occurs when the peripheral nervous system is damaged, causing sensory disturbances, leading to numbness in the limbs. If not detected and treated promptly, the patient may die from respiratory failure and lung aspiration.\n9. Atherosclerosis\nThis is the leading cause of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cerebrovascular accident. Signs of numbness in the hands and feet are due to abnormal material masses sticking to the vessel walls, causing hardening, narrowing of the vessel lumen, and nerve compression.\n10. Some other reasons\nWorking unscientifically\nCarrying heavy objects, sitting or standing for too long in one position, being lazy and frequently sitting under air conditioning will cause nerve damage leading to numbness in the limbs and body fatigue.\nLiving in the wrong posture\nDaily habits such as lying on your side, pillows that are too high, wearing high heels often, etc. can all be the cause of numbness in your limbs.\nThe cause of numbness in the hands and feet is trauma\nPeripheral nerves can be damaged by falls, accidents, and collisions, which can also cause numbness in the limbs.\nWarning !!! Damage to peripheral nerves is the main cause of carpal tunnel syndrome and tarsal tunnel syndrome\nOften fall into a state of stress and fatigue\nFatigue and stress due to work pressure and prolonged life can stimulate nerve cells near the surface of the skin, causing itching and numbness.\n\nCommon symptoms of numbness in hands and feet\nThe initial signs of numbness in the limbs are often very mild: numbness of the fingertips, tingling, paraesthesia, tingling, cramping, fatigue... Therefore, it is easy for patients to be subjective and not seek medical attention early. . As the disease lasts longer, the level of numbness and pain will increase. At this time, the fingers will become more numb and numb, quickly spreading the pain down the arm and forearm, making it difficult to move and hold. At the same time, the same condition may appear in the toes, feet, ankles, legs, thighs, buttocks, lumbar area...\nIn addition, some disease symptoms may occur depending on the causes such as shoulder and neck pain, low back pain due to spinal degeneration; pain along the path of the sciatic nerve due to lumbar disc herniation; Signs of eating a lot and drinking a lot in diabetes; motor paralysis in polyneuritis;...\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nIf symptoms appear continuously for more than 6 weeks, you should immediately go to a medical facility for early examination. In cases where numbness in the limbs only appears after about 1 - 5 weeks, it may be due to mechanical factors and requires further monitoring.\n\nSymptoms\nMany people often tend to underestimate, underestimate, and even ignore the treatment of numbness in their hands and feet, without knowing that this can lead to serious complications for their health and life.\nFrequently causes pain and numbness, causing patients to lose appetite, lose sleep, and seriously deteriorate their health;; Affects motor function, walking, difficulty in living and working;; If not treated promptly, it can lead to serious complications such as: urinary incontinence, muscle atrophy, limb paralysis...; If not detected and treated early, it can lead to tumors and cancer pressing on the nervous system, which is life-threatening.\n\nDiagnostic method\nNormally, doctors will make a diagnosis based on clinical symptoms and imaging to find abnormal signs. Some commonly prescribed methods include:\nX-ray; CT computed tomography; MRI resonance imaging; Electromyography measures muscle strength\nThe results of paraclinical examination combined with clinical symptoms will be the basis for doctors to accurately diagnose the cause and severity of the disease, thereby providing the most appropriate treatment method.\n\nHow to handle and treat\nDepending on the patient's medical condition, the doctor may prescribe medical treatment, using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain relievers (NSAIDs), combined with paracetamol, oral or injectable B vitamins. ,…\nIn addition, based on the cause of the disease, doctors choose combined treatment methods:\nDiabetes: Good blood sugar control; Lipid metabolism disorders: Control blood lipids at a safe level; Vitamin deficiency: Vitamin supplements; Spinal degeneration: Degenerative treatment; Arthritis: Treatment of arthritis; Intoxication: Treatment of intoxication\n\nRecovery measures\nLimb numbness will greatly affect the patient's quality of life. Not only for examination and treatment as prescribed by a specialist, each person can also perform some exercises to help blood circulate and improve health...\n1. Practice yoga\nYoga has long become a popular form of health exercise with very gentle but highly effective exercises, especially for people with numbness in limbs. However, to get the best treatment effect, patients should look for reputable, professional yoga classes to be instructed to practice properly.\n2. Walk\nMusculoskeletal diseases will greatly limit movement for patients, so walking is the simplest and most effective method. It should be noted that while walking, try to maintain a moderate speed, avoid going too fast, vigorous exercise will cause loss of strength, worsen the condition, and affect your health.\n3. Massage\nThe most suitable time to perform massage is before bedtime and last for about 20 - 30 minutes, from ankle to thigh and vice versa, from wrist to shoulder and vice versa. Regularly massaging your hands and feet will help stimulate blood circulation in the body, not only reducing numbness in your hands and feet but also helping you sleep more comfortably.\n\nPrecautions\nTo prevent hand numbness in particular and other dangerous diseases, each person should build for themselves scientific and healthy living, eating and exercise habits.\nThe diet needs to supplement a lot of healthy foods, containing many nutrients and micronutrients that are good for the body, bones and joints, nervous system, blood such as vitamin D, calcium, vitamin K...; Have a daily exercise plan, suitable for your physical condition to make your bones and joints strong, supple, and have stable blood circulation...; Reasonably arrange work and rest time, avoid sitting in one position for a long time, can walk about 5-10 minutes after working continuously for 1-2 hours. Besides, it is also necessary to avoid working for long hours, keep a comfortable spirit, and avoid too much pressure from work.; Foods, drinks, and stimulants such as alcohol, cigarettes, fast food, fried foods, etc. should be minimized because these foods not only contain harmful active ingredients that make the condition worse. Numbness in the hands and feet becomes more and more serious, but also takes away essential nutrients for bones, joints, nervous system and blood.; Always keep your weight at a balanced level. Excessive weight gain can put pressure on the spine, leading to spinal degeneration, disc herniation, etc., pressing on the nerve roots, causing numbness in the limbs.\n\nNutrition for people with numb hands and feet\nThe condition may also be due to a lack of essential nutrients, so patients need to develop a reasonable diet in conjunction with treatment.\nVitamin D and vitamin K are especially important for patients with numbness in limbs, often found in foods such as eggs, fish, soybeans or kale,...\nAccording to research, adequate vitamin D supplementation will help patients increase bone and joint flexibility (3), while vitamin K helps reduce pain and protect and maintain the health of bones and joints, slowing the degenerative process, increase the body's resistance and enhance calcium absorption for strong bones (4).\nNutrition plays an extremely important role in supporting treatment and prevention\nBesides, adding calcium to the body with calcium-rich foods including seafood, bananas, milk... helps slow down musculoskeletal aging. In addition, patients should also avoid eating salty foods because it will speed up the process of bone and joint degeneration.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n1. What disease is numbness in the hands and feet when sleeping?\nThe feeling of numbness in the limbs, tingling, even paralysis, loss of feeling in the limbs when sleeping is due to lying in the wrong position, the pillow is too high, causing pressure on the nerves. But in some cases, it can also be a warning symptom of many dangerous diseases such as cervical spondylosis, peripheral neuritis, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cerebral ischemia, Vitamin B12 deficiency…(5)\n2. Is numbness in hands and feet dangerous?\nNumbness in the arms and legs is a very common symptom, especially when holding a position for a long time such as sitting, standing or when waking up.\nThis condition does not seriously affect life, but if symptoms appear continuously, the patient needs to be examined immediately to check for dangerous internal diseases such as disc herniation, sciatica, rheumatoid arthritis, spinal stenosis, cerebral ischemia due to herniated compression, multiple sclerosis... or not. Therefore, do not be subjective when your body is warning you. Patients should learn about treatment early to avoid unpredictable complications that may occur.\nThus, accurate diagnosis and assessment of limb numbness is very important to guide correct and effective treatment, especially for the elderly who are susceptible to bone and joint diseases, people with diabetes...",
