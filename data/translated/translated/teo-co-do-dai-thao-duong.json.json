Diabetic muscular atrophy (\nDiabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy (DLRPN), diabetic amyotrophy\n) also known as diabetic lumbosacral plexus disease or Bruns-Garland syndrome. The disease is more common in middle age, in patients with type 2 diabetes than in type 1, and in men more than women. The incidence rate is about 4.2 cases per 100 thousand people per year and is often diagnosed late. So what are the causes, symptoms, and effective treatments for muscular atrophy caused by diabetes? The article below will share more specifically about this issue!\n\nCauses of diabetic muscular atrophy\nThe cause of diabetic muscular atrophy is mainly due to abnormal changes in the immune system that damage small blood vessels that feed the nerves that supply the lower limbs. This process is called microangiitis. Muscle atrophy was not related to the duration of diabetes or the severity of the disease. (first)\n\nSymptoms of muscular atrophy due to diabetes\nMuscular atrophy due to diabetes often affects the muscles of the thighs, hips, buttocks, and legs, causing pain and muscle atrophy. Key features of diabetic muscular atrophy:\nWeakness in the lower extremities, buttocks or hips; Muscle atrophy (usually in the front of the thigh).; Pain in the thighs, hips, buttocks or back (sometimes severe).; Usually has a short onset.\nIn addition, diabetic muscular atrophy also has other characteristics that occur in some patients such as:\nChanges in sensation and tingling in the thighs, hips or buttocks.; Patients may also have peripheral neuropathy in the feet and legs (affecting sensation in the feet and toes on both sides of the body).; Weight loss.; Symptoms of muscle atrophy are often on one side and then spread to the other side of the body. This condition occurs faster or slower, often asymmetrically; This condition tends to last several months to 3 years before gradually recovering. Sometimes patients have to move in a wheelchair due to pain and muscle atrophy; Some patients also experience pain or weakness in the arms, chest, or upper back.\nAbnormal changes in the immune system cause damage to small blood vessels that feed nerves, leading to muscle atrophy due to diabetes.\n\nDiagnosis of diabetic muscular atrophy\nTo diagnose diabetic muscular atrophy, a thorough medical history of symptoms and a thorough neurological examination are needed. Neurologists and Endocrinology - Diabetes specialists will do additional necessary tests.\nPatients must do some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies in the body. In addition, patients also need to perform other tests such as:\nA lumbar puncture (the fluid surrounding the spinal cord) to look for signs of inflammation; Electromyography to evaluate nerve conduction to check nerve activity in the legs.; MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the lower back to rule out the possibility of compression of the nerves around the spine.\n\nTreatment of diabetic muscular atrophy\nBasic treatment for diabetic muscular atrophy includes symptomatic treatment, pain control, good blood sugar control, and occupational therapy. Increasing exercise is very important to limit muscle atrophy and increase recovery ability and speed.\nChanging your lifestyle with a reasonable diet and avoiding cigarette smoke also helps the disease recover quickly.\nDoctors will examine and develop a treatment plan for diabetic muscle atrophy depending on each patient's condition. Pain caused by diabetic muscular atrophy, called neuropathic pain or nerve pain, often responds less well to common painkillers such as paracetamol. Specialist nerve pain treatments, including: amitriptyline, antidepressants, anti-epileptic drugs.\nSteroids and immunosuppressants are used to help speed recovery. Treatment time depends on the progression of the disease and the degree of nerve damage in each patient. However, there is no strong evidence about the drug's effectiveness.\nPeople with diabetic muscular atrophy, in addition to using medication for treatment, need to apply the following methods to help control and treat muscle atrophy more effectively:\n1. Exercise moderately\nRegular exercise helps increase resistance and reduces systemic inflammation and muscle inflammation.\nSystemic inflammation contributes to the body's insulin resistance, so exercise increases insulin sensitivity to improve inflammation (muscle, systemic, local). Exercise also helps regulate and increase protein synthesis and reduce protein degradation. Some exercises that people with diabetes can do are: walking, cycling... (2)\n2. Improve your diet\nA healthy diet will help people with diabetes develop muscle and reduce excess fat. Patients can supplement foods containing protein such as fish, eggs, beans... to improve muscle mass loss. In addition, foods rich in vitamin D are found in foods such as salmon, herring, sardines, tuna, oysters, shrimp... It also helps strengthen bones and improve muscles.\n3. Conduct physical therapy\nIn addition to using medication and regular exercise, diabetics with muscle atrophy need to perform physical therapy exercises under the guidance of their doctor to keep their muscles active as much as possible and improve their condition. speed and extent of recovery.\nMuscle atrophy due to diabetes, if not treated early, will progress seriously and cause paralysis\n\nHow to prevent muscle atrophy caused by diabetes\nTo prevent muscle atrophy due to diabetes, patients should note the following:\nAvoid smoking.; Eat moderately but reasonably, limit foods rich in sugar and fat; Maintain healthy body weight.; Regularly have regular health check-ups to control blood sugar levels and avoid complications of diabetes.; Diabetic muscular atrophy can still occur. However, it is likely that recovery will be quicker and easier if these factors have been controlled.\nMuscle atrophy caused by diabetes, if not detected early and treated promptly, will affect health and can even cause disability. If there are symptoms of muscle atrophy, the patient needs to see an Endocrinologist - Diabetes specialist for an effective and safe treatment regimen.",
