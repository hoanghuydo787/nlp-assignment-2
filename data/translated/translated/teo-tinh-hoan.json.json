    "content": "Testicular atrophy: Causes, signs, diagnosis and prevention\n\nTesticles are \"sperm factories\" and are extremely important organs for men. Testicular atrophy due to complications of mumps, varicocele, age, undescended testicles... puts men at risk of infertility. With many years of experience treating male infertility, Dr. Ngo Dinh Trieu Vy - Fertility Support Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City shared \"The result of testicular atrophy is something no man wants. , testicular atrophy affects not only reproductive and sexual health but also psychology, many people are at risk of \"losing both lead and hope\" in terms of both fatherhood and \"manhood\". However, with the development of current medicine, patients can still be treated and have children.\n\nWhat is testicular atrophy?\nTesticular atrophy is a phenomenon in which a man's testicles shrink. Each male will have two testicles and are shaped like eggs. The two testicles are surrounded by the scrotum.\nThe scrotum has the function of regulating the temperature around the testicles. If the temperature is cold, the scrotum will contract and expand when exposed to higher temperatures. This condition can occur due to trauma, varicocele, complications of post-mumps orchitis... (1)\n\nCauses of testicular atrophy\nAccording to Dr. Trieu Vy, there are many causes. Testicular atrophy greatly affects physiology, reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, even impotence and male infertility. Common causes include: (2)\n1. Age\nJust like women have to go through menopause, men also experience a decrease in sex hormones causing hypogonadism, also known as andropause. A man's testosterone concentration will be highest at age 25, and after age 30, the male hormone concentration will gradually decrease by 0.8-1.4% each year. Low testosterone can cause the testicles to atrophy.\n2. Hormone imbalance\nHormone imbalance can cause testicular atrophy. If the body produces less testosterone, the testicles may shrink. Some potential causes of hormonal imbalance, factors that cause decreased testosterone production include:\nTestosterone replacement therapy can cause testicular atrophy. This therapy can stop the production of the hormone gonadotropin. If gonadotropin is not released, the pituitary gland will stop producing luteinizing hormone, causing the testicles to stop producing testosterone.; Taking anabolic steroids or taking estrogen can cause testicular atrophy similar to testosterone replacement therapy.\n3. Orchitis\nOrchitis causes pain and swelling in the testicles. There are many causes of testicular atrophy, but most are due to complications of orchitis after mumps. Mumps virus has a high affinity for testicular parenchyma, causing parenchymal edema, congestion of seminiferous tubules leading to necrosis accompanied by hyalinization of seminiferous tubules and testicular atrophy. The quantity and quality of sperm can be affected depending on the level of damage, the most severe can lead to no sperm in the semen.\nOrchitis caused by mumps is one of the possible causes of infertility, so it is necessary to raise public awareness about measures to prevent mumps, as well as how to handle cases of orchitis caused by mumps. bag. Normally about 10% of people with mumps will have orchitis and 10% of people with orchitis will have testicular atrophy. At this time, the testicles are swollen, the germ cells are damaged and cannot restore themselves, leading to fibrosis and atrophy. In case of atrophy of one testicle, the remaining testicle may grow larger to compensate for the atrophy of the testicle.\nIn addition, orchitis can also be caused by infection with germs, tuberculosis, chlamydia, HIV/AIDS, urinary tract infections or the process of placing catheters or other medical instruments into the penis.\n4. Testicular torsion\nTesticular torsion is often manifested by severe and sudden pain in the testicles. This occurs when the testicles rotate around their axis, causing sudden blockage of the spermatic cord, reducing or blocking blood flow to the testicles. If testicular torsion is not detected and treated promptly, it will cause permanent damage to the testicles, causing atrophy and even requiring amputation.\n5. Using alcohol\nAlcohol abuse and heavy and continuous use of alcohol over a period of time will cause indirect testicular atrophy. When alcohol is absorbed into the body, alcohol will undergo metabolism and produce by-products that cause damage to testicular tissue, testicular membranes and germ cells in the testicles... Besides, oxidation of enzymes also block the metabolic process, making damaged cells unable to recover.\nOxidants in alcohol metabolism also inhibit testosterone production. Alcoholic men have lower testosterone levels, produce more natural opioids and reduce hypothalamic and pituitary hormones, affecting the male hormone production. When men's testosterone levels are low, it can cause testicular atrophy on one or both sides.\n6. Varicocele\nVaricocele is a dilation and torsion of the spermatic plexus. If not detected and treated, varicoceles reduce male fertility, causing pain and testicular atrophy.\n7. Undescended testicles\nUndescended testicles or undescended testicles are a common malformation in children. According to studies, the rate of undescended testicles in full-term children is about 3-5%, in preterm children it is 17-36%. 3 months after birth, due to the increase in male sex hormones, up to 70-75% of the testicles descend into the scrotum, so after 6 months the rate of undescended testicles is about 0.8-1.8%. .\nUntreated undescended testicles will have a reduced number of spermatocytes, delayed maturation or defects in spermatocytes, reduced number of Leydig cells, limited spermatogenic tubules, and immature Sertoli cells. formation, microscopic calcification, evident after 2 years of age, the ultimate consequence is infertility.\nA study by author Nguyen Huu Thanh (2013) with 144 patients over 18 years old, the results showed: 100% of patients with bilateral undescended testicles had no sperm; Only 49.1% of patients with unilateral undescended testicles: have normal sperm density. Newly treated undescended testicles after puberty have fibroatrophic degeneration, reducing the ability to produce sperm regardless of whether the testicles are high or low.\n8. Testicular cancer\nTesticular cancer is quite rare in men but is the most malignant disease affecting men aged 15-35 years old. Testicular cancer occurs when some cells in the testicles grow abnormally out of control, cancer cells divide to form testicular tumors. In some cases, testicular cancer can cause testicular atrophy. Testicular cancer is a disease with a good prognosis if detected early, and the 5-year survival rate in patients is greater than 95%.\n\nSigns of testicular atrophy\nSigns of testicular atrophy are often quite easy to recognize, the main sign is shrinkage of one or both testicles. Depending on the age of the man, there may be a number of different symptoms. (3)\nBefore puberty: signs of testicular atrophy before puberty often include symptoms such as underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics: little facial hair, pubic hair.; After puberty: when palpated, the testicles are detected to be smaller than normal testicle size (average size is 4-5cm and weighs about 20g). The testicles are not tense when touched. Men experience decreased sexual desire, reduced muscle mass, and less facial and pubic hair.\n\nIs testicular atrophy dangerous?\nTesticular atrophy is a dangerous disease that directly affects men's physiology, causing decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and impotence. Testicular atrophy directly affects testosterone production and spermatogenesis, so the risk of infertility increases.\nSex hormone disorders: Testicular atrophy causes this organ to be affected and even unable to function, leading to long-term affected production of the hormone testosterone, which can lead to male malnutrition. The production process of male hormones is affected, leading to a decrease in male sexual desire, no longer interested in sex, greatly affecting marital life.; Reduced fertility: when the testicles atrophy, the spermatogenesis process is affected. The number of men's sperm is not guaranteed in quality and quantity to be able to move to the place where the egg is and fertilize. In some cases, testicular atrophy causes men to face the risk of azoospermia, not having sperm to be able to conceive normally.\n\nDiagnostic method\nTesticular volume is an extremely important parameter in the evaluation of infertile patients with azoospermia. Testicular size is a predictor of the ability to find sperm in the testicles.\nTo diagnose testicular atrophy, the doctor will examine the man's medical history, sexual habits and lifestyle. This provides an overview of whether the patient has a history of sexually transmitted diseases, mumps or alcohol abuse. (4)\nThe andrologist will then further examine the size, structure, and hardness of the testicles. Some blood tests, testicular ultrasound, and endocrine tests will be prescribed to get final results about the patient's condition.\n\nCan testicular atrophy be cured?\nCurrently, the treatment of testicular atrophy depends on the cause of testicular atrophy. If the cause is a sexual tract infection or other infection, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection.\nAccording to doctors, patients with signs of endocrine damage and decreased sexual desire due to testicular atrophy need to be examined and have their endocrine levels adjusted. After the examination, the doctor will give instructions on exercise regimen and use of drugs to regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, not simply supplementing testosterone.\nFor patients whose testicles are atrophied due to undescended testicles, not located in the scrotum but located in the abdomen, orchiectomy may be indicated. Patients with varicocele that weakens sperm life can have both sperm retrieval surgery and varicocele treatment combined.\nWith the development of micro-TESE microsurgical technique to extract testicular tissue to find sperm, many men with testicular atrophy and azoospermia still have the opportunity to become fathers. ”At IVFTA-HCM, we receive many cases of men with testicular atrophy. Recently, there was a case of a man with testicular atrophy due to complications of mumps, whose testicles shrank to only ¼ of their normal size. Doctors at IVFTA-HCM performed micro-TESE surgery to find sperm for testicles as small as peanuts and succeeded in finding 5 remaining sperm in the hair-sized seminiferous tubules. And happiness smiled when the couple had good news thanks to the number of embryos created from the husband's \"little sperm.\"\nMen still have the opportunity to have children thanks to modern treatment techniques.\n\nPrecautions\nTo prevent testicular atrophy, it is necessary to rely on the causes that can lead to this condition. There are many reasons that can cause a man's testicles to shrink, from pathology, steroid use to congenital diseases. Regardless of the cause, men should raise awareness about reproductive health care.\nCurrently, the majority of men in Vietnam are still quite indifferent about regular reproductive health examinations or andrology examinations. Many people have the habit of self-treatment, or through the instructions of relatives, which causes complications. severe consequences later.\nTo prevent testicular atrophy, men can:\nGet mumps vaccine to prevent the risk of mumps. Currently, complications of testicular atrophy due to mumps account for a fairly high rate, and are considered one of the main causes of azoospermia in semen. Currently, the mumps vaccine is often combined into a 3-in-1 vaccine against measles - mumps - rubella. The injection regimen is quite simple, can be given to children from 12 months of age and older, and is highly effective in protection; Quit smoking because smoking damages DNA.; Limit alcohol because this is one of the causes of metabolic disorders; Exercising and exercising regularly, the exercise process helps the body burn excess fat, enhances the process of converting cholesterol into endogenous testosterone instead of converting into estrogen.; Nutrition needs to be focused on, preventing obesity, limiting starch intake and increasing the supply of protein, essential amino acids as well as foods rich in omega3.; Regular health check-ups.\nDoctor Ngo Dinh Trieu Vy is consulting a male infertility patient.\nAccording to Dr. Vy, \"Testicular atrophy, regardless of the cause, needs to be detected early and treated immediately when signs of shrinkage are detected. Currently there is no clinical evidence that there is no natural method to correct testicular atrophy, so early examination is the key to successful treatment.”\nMen should learn information about the normal size and shape of the testicles. If you feel like your testicles have abnormal symptoms, become smaller, have less pubic hair, facial hair... it's best to see a doctor soon. Currently, there are many methods that can treat and preserve fertility in the future.\nAt IVFTA-HCM, the male infertility unit is led by MSc. Dr. Le Dang Khoa, with many years of experience in treating male diseases, helping men with the disease still fulfill their dream of becoming fathers. IVFTA-HCM with the trend of comprehensive and effective treatment, tries to take advantage of even the smallest opportunity for families to soon welcome their children home. Besides, doctors also care about improving the health of children. Men after fertility treatment help men maintain their masculinity and build a warm marriage.\nHopefully this article has provided information about testicular atrophy. If you are interested or looking for a reputable facility to examine if you suspect you have signs of testicular atrophy, you can come to IVFTA-HCM to be examined. A team of experienced male infertility doctors will answer questions and provide specific treatment for each case.",
