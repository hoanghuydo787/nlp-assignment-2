You need to find out the causes and signs\n of this obstetric accident\n as well as how to prevent it to be \"a healthy mother and a healthy child\".\n  According to statistics, in 200 pregnancies, 1 baby is stillborn. The good news is that most pregnant mothers are saved\ncan give birth to a healthy baby in the next pregnancy. If\ncause of stillbirth\n is due to some chromosomal or umbilical cord abnormality, the chances of it happening again are very low. But if\nstillbirth\n originating from a chronic disease in the mother or a genetic disorder in the parents, the risk of recurrence is higher. On average, the chance of a successful pregnancy and childbirth in the future for pregnant women who have had a stillbirth is over 90%.\n\nWhat is stillbirth?\nStillbirth or stillbirth is a condition in which the fetus stops developing after the 20th week of pregnancy and before the mother goes into labor. Stillbirths are classified according to the number of weeks of pregnancy:\nFrom 20 to 27 weeks: early stillbirth; From 28 - 36 weeks: late stillbirth; After 37 weeks: full-term stillbirth\n\nCause of stillbirth\nCauses of stillbirth can vary based on gestational age and underlying risk factors. In some cases, doctors cannot determine the cause of stillbirth. A 2011 study found that in about 1/4 of stillbirths, no cause could be found.\nCommon causes of stillbirth are:\n1. Chromosomal abnormalities and congenital defects\nChromosomal abnormalities (such as chromosomal disorders, chromosomal mutations...) and birth defects in the fetus (placental edema, hydrocephalus, anencephaly...) are the leading causes of stillbirth condition. Statistics show that about 14% of stillbirths comes from this cause.\n2. Intrauterine growth restriction\nIntrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a condition in which the fetus is significantly smaller for gestational age. In severe cases, this condition can cause stillbirth or increase the risk of the baby dying at birth (because the baby is not provided with adequate oxygen or nutrition).\n3. Placental abruption and other obstetric complications\nPlacental abruption is a condition in which the placenta suddenly separates from the uterine wall while the fetus is still in the mother's womb. This is a dangerous obstetric complication that can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth or premature birth. The cause of this phenomenon is due to premature rupture of the mother's membranes, direct trauma to the abdomen or structural abnormalities in the uterus. Pregnant mothers who have an unhealthy lifestyle, such as smoking or using stimulants, also contribute to increasing the risk of placental abruption.\nAlong with placental abruption, other obstetric complications such as multiple pregnancies, amniotic fluid loss, excess amniotic fluid... are also believed to be risk factors leading to stillbirth.\n4. Infection\nIf a pregnant woman has certain bacterial and viral infections, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs), the risk of stillbirth increases. About 13% of stillbirths are due to infections in pregnant women.\n5. Problems with the umbilical cord\nIt's very rare for umbilical cord accidents to occur during pregnancy, such as the cord becoming too tight or the cord being wrapped too tightly around the baby's neck. However, this is an extremely dangerous phenomenon, causing the fetus to be cut off from its supply of oxygen and nutrients, leading to stillbirth. About 10% of stillbirths are related to umbilical cord abnormalities.\n6. Pregnant beyond the due date\nStudies show that women who are pregnant beyond 42 weeks have a higher risk of stillbirth. The cause may be that the placenta has lost its ability to support the fetus.\n7. Mother has some diseases\nSome medical conditions in pregnant women (before pregnancy or discovered during pregnancy) are also associated with an increased risk of stillbirth. These diseases include:\nLupus erythematosus; Blood clotting disorders; Diabetes during pregnancy; Pregnancy hypertension; Heart or thyroid disease; Overweight – obesity\nWomen with gestational hypertension need to be alert to the risk of stillbirth\n8. Tobacco and stimulants\nStudies have shown that pregnant women who smoke, drink alcohol or use some stimulant drugs during pregnancy have a higher risk of stillbirth than other pregnant women.\n\nRecognize the signs of stillbirth\nThe following symptoms may be signs of stillbirth for timely treatment:\nNo more fetal movements: After the 20th week of pregnancy, the fetus begins to move, and the mother is the one who feels the fetal movements most clearly. If suddenly one day, the mother no longer sees the baby in her womb, it is very likely that the fetus died in the mother's uterus.; Uterine height does not increase, or even decreases: At each regular prenatal examination, the mother will have the doctor measure the height of the uterus. This measurement will increase proportionally to the gestational age. But if this index does not change or decreases, you need to check your pregnancy immediately.; Reduced bust size: Breast engorgement and milk secretion is a common phenomenon in most pregnant women. If this phenomenon suddenly disappears, it may be a sign that you need to have a pregnancy test.; Bleeding or dark vaginal discharge accompanied by loss of appetite, nausea, dizziness, back pain, high fever, general fatigue...\n\nWhat should pregnant mothers do when the fetus is stillborn?\nMSc. Dinh Thi Hien Le said, if the doctor has determined that the fetus is no longer there, the mother should suppress her sad emotions to do a few things, such as:\n1. Determine the cause\nDetermining the cause of stillbirth is very important, helping to reduce the risk of stillbirth in the next pregnancy. To do this, while the fetus is still in the mother's womb, the doctor will perform an amniocentesis to check for infection and genetic factors. After birth, the doctor conducts a physical examination of the baby and checks the umbilical cord and placenta for any abnormalities. An autopsy may also be necessary to find out exactly what caused the stillbirth.\n2. Restore health\nAfter stillbirth surgery, you need a certain amount of time to recover, on average 6 - 8 weeks. Try to rest and eat well to shorten this time, recover your health soon and be ready for your next pregnancy.\nOne problem that mothers may encounter after surgery is that their body will secrete milk for 7 - 10 days before stopping completely. This is a natural mechanism in postpartum women. But if this makes you uncomfortable, talk to your doctor to prescribe medications to stop lactation.\n3. Control your mental health\nYou have just experienced a great loss, of course you will not be able to avoid grief. It's impossible to predict how much time you'll need to get over the pain, it could be a few weeks, but it could also be several months or even a year. But you must always stay mentally strong, don't blame yourself or force yourself to quickly \"get over it\". Let everything happen naturally, and find comfort from family, friends and especially your partner.\nIf after a while, you find that you cannot cope with this pain, symptoms of postpartum depression appear such as loss of appetite, difficulty sleeping, loss of interest in life, fear of contact with relatives... , see a psychologist for relief. The doctor will find solutions to help you balance your psychology and stabilize your spirit to soon receive good news.\n\nHow to prevent stillbirth?\nNo mother wants to terminate her pregnancy when her baby is not yet full term. Therefore, to prevent stillbirth, mothers need to follow some principles before and during pregnancy.\nBefore getting pregnant\n1. Quit smoking\nThe chemicals in cigarettes are agents that prevent oxygen and nutrients from being passed from the mother to the fetus. Not only that, thousands of toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke also pass through the placenta to your baby. Therefore, stopping smoking is the first thing you must do when deciding to have a baby.\n2. Maintain a reasonable weight\nOverweight - obese women (BMI ≥ 23) may experience complications during pregnancy such as gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia during pregnancy... - contributing factors increased risk of stillbirth. Therefore, make sure you keep your weight within normal limits (ideal BMI is between 18.5 - 22.9) by eating moderately and exercising regularly before getting pregnant.\nEat scientifically and exercise regularly to achieve your ideal weight before pregnancy\n3. Stay away from alcohol and drugs\nAlong with tobacco, alcohol and drugs can seriously affect fetal development, increasing the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth. Therefore, abstain from alcohol and stimulants before and during pregnancy to ensure your baby is born healthy and safe.\nDuring pregnancy\n4. Monitor fetal movements\nA baby kicking vigorously is a sign that he or she is developing healthily. If you feel the fetus suddenly moves less than usual, go to the hospital for a checkup immediately. By intervening early, you can find the cause of your baby's slow development, thereby promptly preventing stillbirth.\n5. Sleep on your side during the third trimester\nResearch has shown that sleeping on your side during the third trimester is safer for your baby. If you lie on your back, the total weight of your abdomen will put pressure on other organs in your body. Specifically:\nWhen you sleep on your back, the baby and the weight of your belly put pressure on the main blood vessels that supply the uterus. This can restrict blood/oxygen flow to the baby.; In late pregnancy, women who lie on their back more than on their sides will have less activity and their heart rate will slow down. The reason is that the amount of oxygen in the baby's body is lower when the mother lies on her back.\nPregnant women sleeping on their side during the third trimester will be safer for the baby\n6. Take care of yourself\nWhether a pregnancy goes smoothly and whether the baby is born healthy or not depends greatly on the mother's health condition. That means you need to know how to take care of yourself and listen to your body to promptly handle abnormalities that happen to you and your fetus. You should:\nPregnancy check-up on schedule and complete tests as required. This helps doctors closely monitor the development and growth of the fetus. During prenatal visits, the doctor will also diagnose early risks that may occur during pregnancy, such as preeclampsia, diabetes, hypertension...; Tell your doctor about unusual signs that suddenly occur during pregnancy such as bleeding, stomach pain, fever or other symptoms that worry you.; Get a flu shot because women who get the flu while pregnant will increase the risk of stillbirth as well as dangerous health complications.; Supplement folic acid before pregnancy and throughout pregnancy as prescribed by your doctor to reduce the risk of fetal defects.\n\nHow to experience a healthy and safe pregnancy\nWith the goal of accompanying mothers throughout pregnancy, helping mothers experience a safe pregnancy and have a healthy baby, Tam Anh General Hospital with a team of highly qualified and experienced doctors.
