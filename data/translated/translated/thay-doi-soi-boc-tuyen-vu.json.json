    "content": "Fibrocystic breast changes: Causes, symptoms and diagnosis\n\nThe mammary glands change differently during the same menstrual cycle, so having fibrous changes in lesions is considered normal, not a disease. So what is fibrocystic breast change? What are the specific causes, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of fibrocystic breast changes? The article below will talk more about this issue!\n\nWhat is fibrocystic breast change?\nFibrocystic breast change (or fibrocystic breast change) is the most common lesion in the female breast, consisting of tissue with a solid or fibrous structure.\n\nSymptoms of fibrous breast changes\nFibrocystic breast changes do not always cause symptoms. Some people experience breast pain, tenderness and lumps, especially in the upper and outer areas of the mammary gland.\nFibrocystic breast changes may include the following signs and symptoms:\nBreast lumps or a thickening tend to blend into the surrounding breast tissue.; General pain with no clear pain point or tenderness or discomfort in the breast; Nodules or lumps in the breast that change size with the menstrual cycle.; Brown or gray nipple discharge that does not contain blood; the discharge tends to ooze without pressure or squeezing.; Breast changes occur similarly on both sides; Every month, breast pain increases and lumps begin from mid-menstrual cycle (around the time of ovulation) to just before menstruation, then subside when another menstrual cycle begins.\nBreast symptoms tend to be most bothersome just before your period and get better afterward. Simple self-care measures can alleviate this discomfort.\nChanges in mammary gland fibers can easily cause breast pain, tenderness, lumps, etc., affecting the patient's health.\n\nCauses of fibrous changes in the mammary gland\nThe exact cause of fibrocystic breast changes is unknown, but experts suspect that reproductive hormones, especially estrogen, play a role.\nDuring the menstrual cycle, hormone levels change causing discomfort in the breasts and areas of breast tissue that become thickened, tender, painful, and swollen. Fibrocystic breast changes tend to be more uncomfortable before menstruation, decreasing once menstruation begins.\nWhen examined under a microscope, fibrous change breast tissue consists of distinct components such as:\nRound or oval fluid-filled sacs (cysts).; A fibrous mass of fibrous tissue appears (fibrosis).; Overgrowth of cells (hyperplasia) lining the milk ducts or milk-producing tissue of the mammary glands (lobules).; Enlarged lobules in the breast (adenosis).\nFibrocystic breast changes most often occur between the ages of 30 and 50 years old. These changes rarely occur after menopause unless you are taking hormone replacement medications such as estrogen or progesterone.\nIf there are signs of breast pain, unusual nodules or tumors in the breast, you should see a doctor for early treatment.\n\nComplications of fibrous changes in the mammary gland\nThe doctor will examine the mammary gland to check for abnormal breast tissue as well as evaluate the lymph nodes located in the armpit area, above the collarbone.\n\nWhat should you do if you detect fibrous changes in the mammary gland?\nIf you have no symptoms or mild symptoms, no treatment is needed. Cysts that are very painful, large in size, or have pain related to fibrous changes in the breast capsule may need to be considered for treatment.\n\nTreatment of fibrocystic breast changes\nTreatment options for breast cysts include:\nFine needle aspiration: the doctor uses a needle as small as a hair to withdraw fluid from the cyst. The fluid withdrawal has both diagnostic and therapeutic effects, collapsing the cyst and reducing discomfort.; Surgical excision: rarely indicated, some indications may include persistent tumor recurrence despite repeated aspiration, careful monitoring, or tumor with suspicious characteristics.\nSome medication options:\nOver-the-counter pain relievers, such as: acetaminophen (Tylenol, Panadol, or similar) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as: ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, or similar) or prescribed.; Oral contraceptives reduce the concentration of hormones related to the menstrual cycle, leading to changes in mammary gland fibers.\nThe patient will have an ultrasound or fine needle aspiration by the doctor to withdraw fluid from the cyst.\n1. Treat fibrocystic breast changes at home\nYou may be able to ease the symptoms of fibrocystic breast changes through one of the following home treatments:\nWear the right bra with expert advice.; Wear a sports bra when exercising and sleeping, especially when the mammary glands are too sensitive.; Limit or avoid the use of stimulants such as caffeine; Eat less fat.; Reduce or stop hormone therapy if you are postmenopausal (but discuss this with your doctor first).; Use a heating pad or warm water bottle.\n\nWhat should you eat if you have fibrous changes in your mammary glands?\nVitamins and nutritional supplements can reduce symptoms of breast pain and discomfort in some people. However, patients should ask their doctor before using to choose a suitable product that is effective in treatment.\nEvening primrose essential oil.; Vitamin E: taking 200 units (IU) of vitamin E twice daily for 2 months will help improve symptoms. There were no additional benefits after 4 months. For women over 18 years old, pregnant and breastfeeding, the maximum dose of vitamin E is 1,000 mg per day (or 1,500 IU).\nPatients should stop taking it if their breast pain does not improve after a few months. Try only one supplement at a time to clearly determine which one provides pain relief.\n\nWhen do you need to see a doctor?\nMost fibrocystic breast changes are normal, however, see a doctor if:\nThe breast has a long-standing tumor, or a new tumor is discovered, or a hard or thickened area of ​​breast tissue appears.; Breast pain that is constant or gets worse in certain areas; Breast changes continue after the menstrual cycle.; A breast lump has been examined by a doctor, but now the lump appears larger or different from before.\n1. What do you need to prepare when going to the doctor?\nInitially, your doctor will focus on your medical history, then will discuss your symptoms, their relationship to your menstrual cycle, and any other relevant information.\nTo prepare before seeing a doctor, make a list of:\nAll symptoms: even if they seem unrelated to the reason for the appointment.; Important personal information: including dates, results of any previous mammograms.; All medications: vitamins, herbs, functional foods that you are taking.; Questions to ask the doctor: list from most important to least important questions to ask in case of running out of time.; Suggestions to help you ask your doctor:; What causes the symptoms?; Does this condition increase the risk of breast cancer?; What types of tests are needed?; Which treatment method is most effective?; What are the alternatives besides the main method the doctor is recommending?; Is there any need to abstain?; What leaflets or websites do doctors recommend looking at?\nDon't hesitate to ask questions at any time if the patient doesn't understand something.\nPatients should ask their doctors more carefully to know how to care for and improve their condition.\n2. What questions may your doctor ask you?\nWhat are your symptoms and how long have you had them?; Do you have breast pain? If yes, how severe is the pain?; Do your symptoms occur in one or both breasts?; When was your last mammogram?; Have you ever had breast cancer or pre-cancerous breast lesions?; Does your family have a history of cancer?\nIf there are unusual symptoms in the breast such as pain, lumps, nipple discharge... or signs of changes in the mammary gland fibers, the patient should see a doctor for examination, diagnosis, advice, and treatment. Appropriate treatment to protect better health.",
