    "content": "Osteoarthritis of the wrist: Causes, symptoms and treatment\n\nWrist osteoarthritis is a relatively common disease, especially in the elderly. The disease causes pain that makes it difficult for the patient to move and hold objects. The patient's movement, living and working processes are affected. If left untreated, wrist degeneration will cause dangerous complications such as loss of mobility and paralysis.\n\nWhat is wrist osteoarthritis?\nWrist osteoarthritis is a condition of bone and joint damage that occurs in the wrist area, especially in the articular cartilage area, causing cartilage erosion and gradual deterioration. When the articular cartilage in the wrist is eroded, degenerated, and lacking nutrients, that damage can lead to pain, swelling, risk of cracks and fractures, and affect the range of motion of the joint.(1)\nThe disease often appears in middle age. Among them, women account for a high proportion, about 2/3 of the cases. Wrist degeneration is caused by the natural aging process. The cause of the disease is also due to heavy work, repetitive movements, working mainly with hands...\n\nCauses of wrist degeneration\nAge: Elderly people are often susceptible to diseases. As we age, joints and cartilage become more susceptible to wear and fibrosis, causing degeneration; Work: The disease is common in people who do jobs that mainly use their hands for long periods of time, such as working with computers, phones, serving food, etc. These jobs require the patient to use their hands for a lot of time. hours at a time, causing joints to quickly become stiff, swollen, and inflamed; Trauma: Accidents, falls and other injuries can all potentially cause damage and degeneration of the wrist joint, especially in cases of dislocation or fracture of the arm bone.; A history of bone and joint disease: carpal tunnel syndrome, De Quervain syndrome... also has a high risk of wrist osteoarthritis.\n\nSigns of wrist osteoarthritis\nAthritis\nThis is the main symptom of wrist degeneration. The pain is mechanical in nature, it will increase when moving and decrease when resting, and the pain will increase when performing activities in the wrist such as holding objects. Depending on the severity, the pain can be dull or lasting. The level of joint pain will manifest as follows:\nFirst stage: The patient will feel slight pain in the wrist, and there will be a rattling and crunching sound when active; Later stages: The pain becomes more severe and begins to gradually spread to surrounding locations.\nSwelling and stiffness\nPatients often feel stiff in the morning or after a long time of wrist inactivity. When the joints are swollen and stiff, it can cause many difficulties for you when rotating and bending your wrist, and your movements are no longer flexible and graceful.\nOperations lack flexibility\nIf the illness lasts, you will have difficulty holding objects or performing personal activities. The grip strength of the hand is now weakened and the grip of the fingers is lost.\nMuscle atrophy, loss of mobility\nThis is the most serious sign. Degeneration of the wrist joint causes the patient to lose the ability to move the wrist joint, muscle atrophy, joint deformity and complete loss of motor function.\n\nDiagnostic method\nDiagnosis of degenerative wrist arthritis often begins with medical history. The doctor will discuss with the patient about the occurrence of past injuries, symptoms of autoimmune diseases and inflammatory arthritis. During a direct examination, the doctor will evaluate the condition of the wrist and other joints. Other aspects of diagnosis include: (2)\nIdentify pain characteristics.; Ask the patient to perform passive and active exercises to evaluate changes in joint range of motion.; Compare the anatomy and function of the whole wrist.; Conduct X-rays to evaluate changes in bone and cartilage.; Conduct blood tests to rule out other medical conditions.\n\nSymptoms\nSimilar to other degenerative joint diseases, wrist degeneration also progresses slowly over a long period of time. In the early stages, patients almost do not recognize the signs of the disease. Patients often consider it a common joint pain caused by work or weather changes. Therefore, patients do not proactively go to the doctor for timely treatment. Without timely intervention, the condition will worsen and become more difficult to treat. (3)\nJoint deformity: This is the most dangerous complication of this disease. Joint deformity can lead to disability. The bones will rub against each other because the joint is inflamed and has lost cartilage. Over time, the condition will cause the hand to become paralyzed, deformed, muscle atrophy or lead to total hand disability.; Loss of mobility in the hand: When the disease becomes chronic, activities in the wrist are limited, even loss of mobility because the articular cartilage has been completely destroyed.\n\nTreatment of wrist osteoarthritis\nTo find the appropriate treatment, the doctor will ask the patient to conduct X-rays, MRI, electromyography (EMG)... This is to help the doctor consider the severity of the disease. The treatment process aims at 3 main goals: (4)\nSlow down the progression of osteoarthritis, control joint deformity; Improve the quality of life for patients through pain relief measures; Maintain joint mobility and balance mobility through replacing damaged joints.\nTreatment at home\nWhen wrist osteoarthritis is mild, patients can apply home treatment methods to easily control symptoms.\nPlan appropriate rest: When experiencing pain in the wrist area, the patient should let the wrist rest and avoid strenuous activities in this area because it will make the disease worse.; Cold compresses: This treatment method helps reduce pain, inflammation and control tissue damage. The patient uses an ice pack placed in a plastic bag and then applies it to the wrist area for about 15 - 20 minutes.; Apply muscle stretching exercises: Simple, gentle muscle stretching movements will help reduce pain effectively. Exercises that affect the wrist area such as finger curls, fists, wrist stretches...; Applying Oriental medicine remedies: Patients can use oriental medicine, lolot leaves, ginger, mugwort... as ingredients to prepare suitable remedies, helping to control disease symptoms. However, you need to consult your doctor before applying Oriental medicine remedies.\nPhysical therapy\nPhysical therapy will help patients quickly control pain in the wrist area. When performing exercises, you need to have the guidance of a physical therapist. Because when done incorrectly, the condition is likely to get worse, affecting the treatment process. Common physical therapy exercises for people with wrist osteoarthritis include:\nElectrical current stimulation through the skin; Ultrasound therapy; Pain relief massage; Heat therapy\nAlthough physical therapy takes a long time, it will be highly effective in the treatment process. Patients will regain flexibility in the elbow and wrist joints, easily controlling disease symptoms.\nUse Western medicine\nMedicines used to treat diseases such as oral medicines, intramuscular injections, antibiotics, pain relievers... With this treatment method, the patient needs to ensure compliance with the specialist's instructions. This will help you avoid complications such as muscle atrophy, high blood pressure, diabetes, osteoporosis... Some common drugs to treat wrist and elbow osteoarthritis include:\nCommon pain relievers: Acetaminophen, paracetamol, tramadol,...; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs: Naproxen, Aspirin, Diclofenac, Ibuprofen...; Intravenous or oral administration: Corticosteroid; Narcotic pain relievers: Opioids; Muscle relaxants\nAlthough it has a very quick pain relief effect, treating the disease with medication is not the optimal solution to completely eliminate the symptoms of the disease. Patients should not abuse medication to relieve pain. Because when used for a long time, patients are at risk of facing some extremely dangerous side effects of the drug, causing adverse effects on their health.\nSurgery\nWhen medical treatment is ineffective or there is a risk of serious complications, the doctor will recommend surgery. Depending on the specific case, the surgical method will be different:\nPreventive surgery: The purpose of this treatment is to balance the condition of the wrist joint and maintain joint activity.; Conservative surgery: This treatment method is applied to intervene in joints that have not been seriously damaged, to restore some mechanical functions of the joint and improve joint mobility.; Replacement surgery: This treatment method is applied when all of the above treatments are ineffective or the joints are seriously damaged and require specialized intervention.\n\nPreventing wrist osteoarthritis\nTo prevent serious damage to the wrist joint, patients need to avoid putting stress on the joint through adjusting daily activities such as:\nMove your wrist gently when twisting, pulling or pushing.; Avoid using your wrists to lift heavy objects; Pay attention to regular wrist movements to reduce stiffness.; Consider wearing a wrist rest when working a lot on the computer or when playing sports again.; Planning a reasonable, healthy diet helps prevent and treat wrist arthritis more effectively. You should supplement many necessary nutrients and vitamins for your body, especially vitamin B.; You can soak your hands in warm saline water, twice a day (in the morning when you wake up, in the evening before going to bed), for about 10 minutes each time.; The wrist is a part that works a lot and is subject to a lot of pressure in daily activities. Therefore, this part is susceptible to gradual degeneration over time.\nCenter for Orthopedic Trauma, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is where a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons gather such as: TTND.Prof.Dr.Nguyen Viet Tien; Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa; Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh; MSc. Tran Anh Vu; Dr. Tran Xuan Anh, Dr. Le Dinh Khoa, Dr. Do Tien Dung; Dr. BS.CKII Vu Huu Dung... This is also one of the pioneer units in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal diseases with modern techniques according to updated international protocols.\nThe hospital is also equipped with modern machinery and imaging equipment such as: Somatom Drive 768-slice CT scanner, new generation Magnetom Amira BioMatrix magnetic resonance machine, Artis Pheno robot, densitometer. bones, ultrasound machines...; Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss surgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table... to be able to detect injuries early and effectively treat musculoskeletal diseases...\nTam Anh General Hospital also owns a spacious clinic system and high-class boarding area; modern rehabilitation area; Comprehensive post-operative care process helps patients quickly recover and stabilize their health after surgery.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Orthopedics Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nPatients need to see a doctor early when there are signs of wrist osteoarthritis.
