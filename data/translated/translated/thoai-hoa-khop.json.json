    "content": "Osteoarthritis: Causes, symptoms, treatment and prevention\n\nOsteoarthritis is a common form of arthritis that affects millions of people worldwide. This condition occurs when the protective layer of cartilage that cushions the ends of bones is damaged or injured. If not treated promptly, it can lead to disability for the patient.\n\nWhat is osteoarthritis?\nOsteoarthritis is a chronic disorder that damages cartilage and tissues surrounding joints. Articular cartilage is considered a cushion covering the bone surface, made of cartilage cells and basic substances. Articular cartilage has a protective function, reducing friction in the joint and acting as a \"shock absorber\".\nDegeneration of the joints is the most common of more than 100 different types of arthritis. The condition affects approximately 27 million Americans and nearly everyone over the age of 80. Younger men are more susceptible to osteoarthritis due to injury. However, after age 70, the incidence is equal between both sexes. According to research, this condition is also related to racial issues. Research results show that the rate of osteoarthritis in Japanese people is quite high while black people in North Africa, East Indians and Northern people In China, the infection rate is very low. (first)\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the period from 2011 to 2020 is considered the \"Decade of bones and joints\" by the World Health Organization (WHO). Particularly in Vietnam, according to estimates in a study on osteoarthritis, this condition is increasingly common and showing signs of rejuvenation. Statistics show that 30% of people over the age of 35, 60% of people over the age of 65 and 85% of people over the age of 85 have problems with osteoarthritis. (2)\n\nLocation of osteoarthritis\nDegenerative arthritis can affect every joint in the body, some joints are affected a lot such as the knee, spine, groin, fingers, ankles... Usually, you will only experience symptoms in 1 joint. or several joints at once.\n1. Knee osteoarthritis\nKnee osteoarthritis is the most common condition, occurring when the cartilage covering the knee joint is worn out, torn or dissolved. The bones of the knee joint that are no longer protected by the cartilage layer rub against each other, causing pain, inflammation, and limiting movement. In many cases, degenerative arthritis promotes bone spurs on the knee joint to form, leading to knee osteoarthritis and worsening.\n2. Hip osteoarthritis\nPatients with degenerative hip disease often have difficulty walking. In the early stages of the disease it is often difficult to diagnose because the pain can appear in different locations, including the groin, thigh, buttocks or knee. The pain can be sharp and sharp or it can be dull and the hip is often stiff\n3. Sacroiliac joint degeneration\nThe most common symptoms of sacroiliitis are usually low back and hip pain, numbness in the legs when sitting in one position for a long time, and fatigue. Sacroiliitis is a condition of arthritis, swelling and pain in the coccyx joint located below the lumbar spine and the upper humerus. Patients can have it in one joint or both sacroiliac joints.\n4. Osteoarthritis of the wrist and hand\nDegeneration of joints in the hands and wrists is common in older people. At this time, the amount of blood supplied to nourish the joint area in general and the joints of the hands and fingers is reduced, causing nutritional deficiency in the cartilage, reducing the ability to withstand daily and continuous impacts on the cartilage. joint.\nSee more: What is wrist osteoarthritis?\n5. Osteoarthritis of the ankle\nDegenerative arthritis of the ankle often occurs in people over 40 or have jobs that use the ankle a lot, such as athletes, football players, etc. The disease progresses slowly, with initial symptoms that are vague and difficult to recognize. know. In the severe stage, the patient will feel pain in the ankle joint, feel heavy and less flexible when moving. Sharp pain comes when the patient exerts effort or directly impacts the damaged joint area.\n6. Cervical spondylosis\nCervical spondylosis causes neck or lumbar pain. Bone spurs that form along the joint spine (spinal spurs) can irritate spinal nerves, causing severe pain, numbness and tingling in the affected parts of the body.\n\nCauses of joint degeneration\nPrimary cause\nOsteoarthritis occurs in relation to age. The water content in articular cartilage gradually increases with age. This causes the content and quality of Protein in the cartilage to decrease, leading to the articular cartilage beginning to degenerate. Exercising for a long time causes this cartilage to be damaged, causing cracking, peeling and even cartilage loss, increasing friction between joints, causing pain and degeneration.\nSecondary cause\nGenetics: This condition occurs in some subjects with genetic defects in genes that function to form cartilage. This leads to loss of joint cartilage, accelerating degeneration; Obesity: Being overweight increases the risk of degeneration in the knee, hip and spine joints. Therefore, maintaining body mass index or losing weight to the ideal weight helps prevent degeneration as well as reduce the rate of progression when the disease begins to form.; Injury:  This is considered a favorable condition for the development of degenerative arthritis.; High-frequency joint overuse: Overuse of certain joints increases the risk of developing osteoarthritis. For example, people who often work hard with their hands and feet, such as loading and unloading, or doing manual work, have a higher risk of developing osteoarthritis of the wrists and ankles.; Affected by other bone and joint diseases: People with rheumatoid arthritis are more likely to develop osteoarthritis. Additionally, some rare conditions, such as iron overload or growth hormone excess, increase the chance of developing the disease.\n\nSymptoms of degenerative arthritis\nSymptoms of osteoarthritis often develop slowly and become more severe over time. The most common signs include: (3)\nPain: Affected joints may be painful during or after movement. The pain is often dull and disappears when the patient is inactive. If not treated promptly, the pain will increase in severity and last longer, causing the patient more pain and discomfort.; Joint stiffness: This symptom is often accompanied by pain and is most easily seen after the patient wakes up, or after a period of inactivity; Joint clicking sounds when moving: The patient may feel a burning sensation when using the joint and may hear popping or clicking sounds when moving.; Muscle atrophy and swelling: Prolonged osteoarthritis often leads to swelling that deforms the joints and muscles around the joints. If you don't exercise for a long time, it will cause muscle atrophy, the knee will be misaligned, etc.\n\nDiagnostic method\nAccording to the diagnostic criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), 1991, osteoarthritis can be diagnosed based on:\nRisk factor\nDetection of bone spurs at the edge of the joint (on X-ray).; There is a degenerative epidemic.; Age over 38 years old; There are signs of joint stiffness for less than 30 minutes.; Clicking and clicking sounds appear when moving the joint.\nClinical manifestations\nJoint effusion: sometimes seen in the knee joint, due to the inflammatory reaction of the synovial membrane.; Joint deformity: Bone spurs appear, due to joint axis misalignment or synovial herniation.\nDiagnostic imaging methods\nConventional X-ray: Kellgren and Lawrence's criteria for diagnosing osteoarthritis: Stage 1: Appearance of small bone spurs or suspected bone spurs. Stage 2: Obvious bone spur growth. Stage 3: Moderate joint space narrowing. Stage 4: Joint space narrowing accompanied by subchondral bone fibrosis; Stage 1: Small bone spurs appear or bone spurs are suspected.; Stage 2: Obvious bone spur growth; Stage 3: Moderate joint space narrowing; Stage 4: Joint space narrowing accompanied by subchondral bone fibrosis; Joint ultrasound: This method is to check joint space narrowing, bone spurs, joint effusion, measure the thickness of joint cartilage and synovial membrane, and help detect degenerative pieces of cartilage that have fallen into the joint socket.; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This method can fully visualize joints with three-dimensional images, helping to detect damage to articular cartilage, ligaments, and membranes. synovial fluid.; Arthroscopy: This method helps to directly observe degenerative lesions of articular cartilage at different levels, combined with synovial membrane biopsy to do differential diagnostic cell testing for joint diseases. other.; Do blood and biochemical tests: Measure normal blood sedimentation rate.; Synovial fluid: Synovial fluid cells < 1000 cells/1mm3.\nSubjects susceptible to disease\nWho is susceptible to osteoarthritis? In the minds of many people, this is a disease of the elderly. This phenomenon occurs when the body begins to enter the aging stage, however with the trend of increasingly younger people, this disease of osteoarthritis is becoming more and more common in many groups such as:\nElder;; People who work with their hands on a regular and continuous basis; People who practice high-intensity sports and have a history of injury;; People with congenital deformities or secondary deformities after trauma;; Overweight and obese people;\n\nIs osteoarthritis dangerous?\nOsteoarthritis, if not treated and diagnosed promptly, can cause many dangerous complications such as:\nGout: This is considered a complication of osteoarthritis, this condition leads to changes in cartilage leading to the formation of sodium urate crystals in the joints leading to gout and painful swelling.; Depression and anxiety: Many studies have found that pain caused by degenerative arthritis is closely related to depression and anxiety, many patients share that they have mental worries when suffering from the disease.; Weight gain: When joints are swollen and painful, the patient tends to be less active, which leads to the risk of obesity due to lack of exercise.; Sleep disorders: Painful muscles make it difficult for the patient to fall asleep and have a good and deep sleep.; Calcification of articular cartilage: Osteoarthritis causes calcium crystals to be deposited in the cartilage. Calcification of joint cartilage makes inflammation worse, which can lead to acute pain.\nOther degenerative arthritis complications include:\nBone necrosis;; Fracture;; Bleeding or infection;; Tendons and ligaments around joints are damaged;\n\nTreatment of degenerative arthritis\nThere is no cure for osteoarthritis, but the condition does not necessarily get worse over time. There are a number of treatments to help reduce symptoms of joint pain caused by degenerative arthritis.\nDo exercise\nThis is the most important treatment for people with degenerative arthritis. Recommended exercises include a combination of activities that help strengthen muscles and improve fitness.\nMany people think that exercising will make the pain caused by the disease worse, increasing the risk of joint stiffness. However, regular exercise helps you move, build muscle and strengthen normal joints. helps improve symptoms. Physical training is also a great aid for losing weight, adjusting posture, reducing stress and especially effectively improving symptoms.\nYour doctor, or a physical therapist, will discuss the benefits you may get from exercise and may give you an exercise plan to follow at home. The training process needs to follow the given plan to avoid incorrect exercises that can negatively affect the joints.\nLosing weight\nBeing overweight or obese makes osteoarthritis worse. To know whether you are overweight or obese, you can use appropriate weight calculators.\nIf you are overweight or obese, try to lose weight by participating in physical activity and eating a healthier diet.\nAnalgesic\nSome pain relievers may be recommended by your doctor as part of your treatment to improve symptoms. The type of pain medication will depend on the severity of your pain and any other health conditions or problems you have. Some recommended medications include:\nParacetamol\nIf you have pain from osteoarthritis, your doctor may recommend paracetamol as treatment. When taking paracetamol, always use the dose recommended by your GP and do not exceed the maximum dose stated on the packaging.\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nIf using paracetamol does not help you effectively control your pain, your doctor may prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\nNSAIDs are pain relievers that work by reducing inflammation, some NSAIDs are available as creams that you can apply directly to affected joints. In addition to helping relieve pain, they can also help reduce joint swelling.\nYour doctor will discuss with you the type of NSAID you should take and the benefits and risks associated with it.\nNSAID tablets may be needed if paracetamol and NSAID creams do not relieve the pain. They may not be suitable for people with certain conditions such as asthma, stomach ulcers or angina, heart attack or stroke. If you are taking low-dose aspirin, ask your doctor whether you should use NSAIDs.\nIf your doctor recommends or prescribes an NSAID to take by mouth, he or she will usually also prescribe a medicine called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to take at the same time. NSAIDs can break down the lining in the stomach to protect it from stomach acid. PPIs reduce the amount of acid produced by the stomach, reducing the risk of damage to your stomach lining.\nSteroid injections\nSteroids are a type of medication that contain man-made versions of the hormone cortisol and are sometimes used to treat particularly painful musculoskeletal problems.\nSome people with osteoarthritis are recommended steroid injections when other treatments have not had positive results. The injection will be made directly into the affected area. You may be given a local anesthetic first to numb and relieve pain. Steroid injections work quickly and can relieve pain within weeks or months.\nUse autologous platelet-rich plasma\nUsing PRP to treat joint problems is a modern solution researched for quick effectiveness with natural self-healing ability, safe for the patient.\nApply hot or cold compresses\nApplying heat or cold to joints may reduce the pain and symptoms of osteoarthritis in some people. You can prepare yourself with a bottle of water or a hot and cold compress and apply it directly to the painful area.\nSupport equipment\nIf degenerative arthritis is causing mobility problems or making it difficult to carry out daily tasks, a number of devices can help treat and improve this. If you have a degenerative condition in your lower extremities, such as your hips, knees or feet, your physical therapist will recommend specialized shoes for you.\nSpecialized shoes with shock-absorbing soles can help relieve some of the pressure on the joints in your feet as you walk. Special lining can help disperse your weight more evenly. Splints and foot supports work the same way. If osteoarthritis in the hips or knees affects mobility, you may need to use a walking aid such as a cane or crutches. Manual therapy\nInfrequent movement and use of muscles can increase stiffness caused by osteoarthritis. This therapy is a technique that uses your hands to stretch and massage body tissues to keep your joints supple and flexible.\nSurgery\nSurgery to treat osteoarthritis is only necessary in a small number of cases where other treatments have failed or the joint is seriously damaged. This surgery can significantly improve your symptoms, mobility, and quality of life.\nJoint replacement\nJoint replacement is joint reconstruction surgery, which can be applied to most joints such as knees, hips, fingers, etc. During joint replacement surgery, the doctor will remove the damaged joint and replace it with an artificial joint made of special biomedical materials. The lifespan of an artificial joint can last 15-20 years or more.\n\nPrevention\nAlthough inflammation from osteoarthritis is more common as we age, it is not an inevitable part of the aging process. As researchers work to understand the causes of osteoarthritis, they can offer advice to help prevent the disease or its progression and reduce its impact on your life.\nWeight control\nIf you are at a healthy weight, maintaining that weight can help you prevent developing the disease. If you are overweight, losing weight may be the best method of preventing osteoarthritis.\nAccording to data from NHANES, obese women are nearly 4 times more likely to develop osteoarthritis than normal women. The risk for obese men is nearly five times higher than for non-obese men. Losing as little as 5% of your body weight can reduce stress on your knees, hips, and lower back.\nGet healthy through exercise\nA scientific exercise regimen helps improve health condition as well as enhance flexibility and suppleness of joints. However, to avoid unnecessary injuries, you should exercise at a reasonable intensity, accompanied by a guide to avoid incorrect movements that affect the joints.\nAvoid injury\nInjuring a joint at a young age can lead to osteoarthritis of the same joint as you get older. To avoid joint injuries when exercising or playing sports, keep these recommendations in mind:\nDo not bend more than 90 degrees when performing knee bends.; Always keep your feet as flat as possible while stretching to avoid knee injuries.; When jumping, land with bent knees.; Warm up before participating in sports or physical activities; Wear shoes that fit well.; Exercise on soft surfaces with friction, avoid exercising on hard surfaces such as asphalt roads or concrete yards.\nIf you have a joint injury, it is important to get prompt medical treatment and take steps to avoid further damage.\nHealthy eating\nWhile no specific diet has been shown to prevent the disease, certain nutrients have been linked to reducing the risk of the disease or the severity of the condition, such as supplementation. Omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, eat lots of green vegetables, fruits and limit high-temperature processed foods.\nReference: What should you eat and avoid with osteoarthritis?\n\nHow to care for sick people\nWith the right support and care, people can lead a healthy life without facing too many risks from disease.\nHealthy living\nA healthy diet and regular exercise will help keep your muscles strong and control your weight, which is great for osteoarthritis and has other health benefits.\nTake medicine as directed by your doctor\nRemember your doctor's prescription and take your medication as directed, even if your symptoms have subsided. If there are any questions or side effects that the patient thinks they are experiencing when using the drug, they should immediately notify their doctor for advice and more appropriate options. Talk to your doctor if you want to change to a different prescription or different type of medication.\nGet regular check-ups\nDegenerative arthritis is a long-term condition, patients should have regular check-ups to be evaluated and receive advice from their doctor about their symptoms or current condition.\nVaccination\nPeople with long-term conditions such as osteoarthritis are encouraged to get an annual flu shot to protect against the flu. Some other recommended vaccines include pneumococcal vaccine, which helps protect against pneumococcal pneumonia.\n\nOsteoarthritis treatment at Tam Anh General Hospital\nWith a team of highly specialized Medical and Surgical Musculoskeletal experts, applying many advanced techniques in Musculoskeletal Treatment, Tam Anh General Hospital System has successfully examined and treated millions of cases. musculoskeletal diseases.\nFor advice and to schedule an examination for Musculoskeletal Pathologies at Tam Anh General Hospital System, you can contact: Hanoi: 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Bo De Ward, Long Bien District, Hanoi.

            "subsection_string": "Diagnostic method\nAccording to the diagnostic criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), 1991, osteoarthritis can be diagnosed based on:\nRisk factor\nDetection of bone spurs at the edge of the joint (on X-ray).; There is a degenerative epidemic.; Age over 38 years old; There are signs of joint stiffness for less than 30 minutes.; Clicking and clicking sounds appear when moving the joint.\nClinical manifestations\nJoint effusion: sometimes seen in the knee joint, due to the inflammatory reaction of the synovial membrane.; Joint deformity: Bone spurs appear, due to joint axis misalignment or synovial herniation.\nDiagnostic imaging methods\nConventional X-ray: Kellgren and Lawrence's criteria for diagnosing osteoarthritis: Stage 1: Appearance of small bone spurs or suspected bone spurs. Stage 2: Obvious bone spur growth. Stage 3: Moderate joint space narrowing. Stage 4: Joint space narrowing accompanied by subchondral bone fibrosis; Stage 1: Small bone spurs appear or bone spurs are suspected.; Stage 2: Obvious bone spur growth; Stage 3: Moderate joint space narrowing; Stage 4: Joint space narrowing accompanied by subchondral bone fibrosis; Joint ultrasound: This method is to check joint space narrowing, bone spurs, joint effusion, measure the thickness of joint cartilage and synovial membrane, and help detect degenerative pieces of cartilage that have fallen into the joint socket.; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This method can fully visualize joints with three-dimensional images, helping to detect damage to articular cartilage, ligaments, and membranes. synovial fluid.; Arthroscopy: This method helps to directly observe degenerative lesions of articular cartilage at different levels, combined with synovial membrane biopsy to do differential diagnostic cell testing for joint diseases. other.; Do blood and biochemical tests: Measure normal blood sedimentation rate.; Synovial fluid: Synovial fluid cells < 1000 cells/1mm3.\nSubjects susceptible to disease\nWho is susceptible to osteoarthritis? In the minds of many people, this is a disease of the elderly. This phenomenon occurs when the body begins to enter the aging stage, however with the trend of increasingly younger people, this disease of osteoarthritis is becoming more and more common in many groups such as:\nElder;; People who work with their hands on a regular and continuous basis; People who practice high-intensity sports and have a history of injury;; People with congenital deformities or secondary deformities after trauma;; Overweight and obese people;"

            "subsection_content": "There is no cure for osteoarthritis, but the condition does not necessarily get worse over time. There are a number of treatments to help reduce symptoms of joint pain caused by degenerative arthritis.\nDo exercise\nThis is the most important treatment for people with degenerative arthritis. Recommended exercises include a combination of activities that help strengthen muscles and improve fitness.\nMany people think that exercising will make the pain caused by the disease worse, increasing the risk of joint stiffness. However, regular exercise helps you move, build muscle and strengthen normal joints. helps improve symptoms. Physical training is also a great aid for losing weight, adjusting posture, reducing stress and especially effectively improving symptoms.\nYour doctor, or a physical therapist, will discuss the benefits you may get from exercise and may give you an exercise plan to follow at home. The training process needs to follow the given plan to avoid incorrect exercises that can negatively affect the joints.\nLosing weight\nBeing overweight or obese makes osteoarthritis worse. To know whether you are overweight or obese, you can use appropriate weight calculators.\nIf you are overweight or obese, try to lose weight by participating in physical activity and eating a healthier diet.\nAnalgesic\nSome pain relievers may be recommended by your doctor as part of your treatment to improve symptoms. The type of pain medication will depend on the severity of your pain and any other health conditions or problems you have. Some recommended medications include:\nParacetamol\nIf you have pain from osteoarthritis, your doctor may recommend paracetamol as treatment. When taking paracetamol, always use the dose recommended by your GP and do not exceed the maximum dose stated on the packaging.\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nIf using paracetamol does not help you effectively control your pain, your doctor may prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\nNSAIDs are pain relievers that work by reducing inflammation, some NSAIDs are available as creams that you can apply directly to affected joints. In addition to helping relieve pain, they can also help reduce joint swelling.\nYour doctor will discuss with you the type of NSAID you should take and the benefits and risks associated with it.\nNSAID tablets may be needed if paracetamol and NSAID creams do not relieve the pain. They may not be suitable for people with certain conditions such as asthma, stomach ulcers or angina, heart attack or stroke. If you are taking low-dose aspirin, ask your doctor whether you should use NSAIDs.\nIf your doctor recommends or prescribes an NSAID to take by mouth, he or she will usually also prescribe a medicine called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to take at the same time. NSAIDs can break down the lining in the stomach to protect it from stomach acid. PPIs reduce the amount of acid produced by the stomach, reducing the risk of damage to your stomach lining.\nSteroid injections\nSteroids are a type of medication that contain man-made versions of the hormone cortisol and are sometimes used to treat particularly painful musculoskeletal problems.\nSome people with osteoarthritis are recommended steroid injections when other treatments have not had positive results. The injection will be made directly into the affected area. You may be given a local anesthetic first to numb and relieve pain. Steroid injections work quickly and can relieve pain within weeks or months.\nUse autologous platelet-rich plasma\nUsing PRP to treat joint problems is a modern solution researched for quick effectiveness with natural self-healing ability, safe for the patient.\nApply hot or cold compresses\nApplying heat or cold to joints may reduce the pain and symptoms of osteoarthritis in some people. You can prepare yourself with a bottle of water or a hot and cold compress and apply it directly to the painful area.\nSupport equipment\nIf degenerative arthritis is causing mobility problems or making it difficult to carry out daily tasks, a number of devices can help treat and improve this. If you have a degenerative condition in your lower extremities, such as your hips, knees or feet, your physical therapist will recommend specialized shoes for you.\nSpecialized shoes with shock-absorbing soles can help relieve some of the pressure on the joints in your feet as you walk. Special lining can help disperse your weight more evenly. Splints and foot supports work the same way. If osteoarthritis in the hips or knees affects mobility, you may need to use a walking aid such as a cane or crutches. Manual therapy\nInfrequent movement and use of muscles can increase stiffness caused by osteoarthritis. This therapy is a technique that uses your hands to stretch and massage body tissues to keep your joints supple and flexible.\nSurgery\nSurgery to treat osteoarthritis is only necessary in a small number of cases where other treatments have failed or the joint is seriously damaged. This surgery can significantly improve your symptoms, mobility, and quality of life.\nJoint replacement\nJoint replacement is joint reconstruction surgery, which can be applied to most joints such as knees, hips, fingers, etc. During joint replacement surgery, the doctor will remove the damaged joint and replace it with an artificial joint made of special biomedical materials. The lifespan of an artificial joint can last 15-20 years or more.",
