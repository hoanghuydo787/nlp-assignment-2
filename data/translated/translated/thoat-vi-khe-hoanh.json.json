    "content": "Hiatal hernia: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment\n\nHiatal hernia is mostly asymptomatic. Patients often discover the disease when they have symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux or accidentally go to see a doctor for another problem.\n\nWhat is a hiatal hernia?\nHiatal hernia is a condition in which part of the stomach protrudes into the chest. Normally the stomach is located below the diaphragm, a thin dome-shaped muscle that separates the organs in the chest and abdomen. The esophagus is a tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach, and this tube passes through a hole in the diaphragm to the abdomen. When there is a hiatal hernia, the stomach passes through that hole into the chest. (2)\nThe disease is often divided into 4 types, including:\nType I: often called sliding hernia, occurs when the esophageal-stomach junction (cardium) slides above the diaphragm. This is the most common form of hiatal hernia and causes symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux.; Type II: the highest part of the stomach (fundus) slides up over the diaphragm.; Form III: is a combination of forms I and II; Type IV: large hernia hole, in addition to the stomach, other organs such as the colon, spleen, pancreas, and small intestine can also crawl into the chest.\nTypes II, III, IV are variants of paraesophageal hernia, accounting for 5-15% of diaphragmatic hernia cases. This condition is rare but can be serious if the stomach is at an angle. Paraesophageal hernias can cause stomach bleeding or difficulty breathing.\nTypes of hiatal hernia\nVietsub: Hiatal hernia: diaphragmatic hernia Normal: normal Normal diaphragm: normal diaphragm Weak diaphragm: weak diaphragm Sliding hiatal hernia: sliding hernia Rolling hiatal hernia: rolling hernia Paraesophageal hiatal hernia: paraesophageal hernia\n\nCause of diaphragmatic hernia\nThe cause of hiatal hernia is not always clear, but the following factors may include:\nChanges in the diaphragm due to age; Damage to this area due to trauma or surgery; Natural; Frequent and prolonged increase in abdominal pressure due to coughing, vomiting, and straining during bowel movements, exercise, and lifting heavy objects.(3)\n\nSymptoms of hiatal hernia\nSmall hernias usually do not cause symptoms. In case of a large hernia, the patient may experience the following symptoms:\nBurning behind the sternum; Spitting food or liquid into the mouth; Stomach or chest pain; Difficulty swallowing; Eat quickly and feel full; Nausea; Shortness of breath; Vomiting blood or having black stools; Unexplained cough\nHiatal hernia can cause symptoms of frequent coughing for unknown reasons\n\nMethods of diagnosing hiatal hernia\nHiatal hernia can be discovered accidentally when the patient goes to the doctor for another disease and has an X-ray, CT or MRI of the chest-abdomen. In cases where patients have symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, when performing an endoscopy, the doctor can detect a diaphragmatic hernia.\nIn addition, to diagnose diaphragmatic hernia, the doctor may also recommend other methods such as X-ray of the esophagus and stomach by giving the patient a contrast agent, CT scan, MRI of the chest-abdomen. (first)\n\nWhat methods do doctors use to treat hiatal hernia?\n1. Medical treatment\nIf a hiatal hernia does not cause symptoms, it usually does not require treatment. For cases that cause symptoms, doctors will use medications commonly used for gastroesophageal reflux.\nAntacids are often used for cases of hiatal hernia with gastroesophageal reflux.\n2. Treat diaphragmatic hernia with surgery\nSometimes, a hiatal hernia requires surgery. Surgery is often used for patients who are ineffective on medication, or have complications such as severe inflammation or esophageal strictures.\nSurgery to repair a hiatal hernia may include pulling the stomach and herniated organs down into the abdomen, making the opening of the diaphragm smaller, and possibly creating an anti-reflux valve. In some cases, hiatal hernia surgery is combined with weight loss surgery, such as sleeve gastrectomy.\nCurrently, diaphragmatic hernia surgery is often performed through laparoscopy, which is a minimally invasive surgery. In it, the surgeon will use a number of small incisions in the abdomen to insert specialized tools into the abdominal cavity. The doctor performs the operation while viewing magnified images of the patient's internal organs displayed on a video screen.\nLifestyle measures\nSome measures that can help control symptoms of acid reflux include:\nEat more meals and less food at each meal instead of overeating; Avoid eating some foods that make reflux worse such as fatty foods, fried foods, alcohol, coffee, chocolate, onions, garlic.; Avoid lying down right after eating or eating late at night before bed; Stop smoking; Raise the head of the bed when sleeping (about 15cm)\nAnd the most important thing is that people should have regular health checks to screen and detect diseases early so they can be treated effectively.\nGastrointestinal Endoscopy & Surgery Center at Tam Anh General Hospital is a reputable unit for examination and surgical treatment of digestive diseases, including extra-gastrointestinal diseases such as hiatal hernia. . In particular, the Gastrointestinal Endoscopy & Surgery Center is the first place in Southeast Asia to apply mechanical hand-held robotic instruments combined with the ICG Rubina 3D/4K endoscopic surgery system in laparoscopic surgery. Treatment of gastrointestinal diseases is highly effective and reduces costs for patients.\nTo make an appointment for examination, treatment, and surgery for hiatal hernia as well as other digestive diseases, please contact: Tam Anh General Hospital System, Hanoi: 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Bo De Ward, District Long Bien, Hanoi City Make an appointment: 024 3872 3872 – 024 7106 6858“>024 3872 3872 – 024 7106 6858 Ho Chi Minh City: 2B Pho Quang, Ward 2, Tan Binh District, Ho Chi Minh City Make an appointment: 0287 102 6789 – 093 180 6858“>0287 102 6789 – 093 180 6858 Fanpage: Tam Anh General Hospital Website: https://tamanhhospital.vn",
