    "content": "Atrial septal defect: Causes, symptoms and treatment\n\nAtrial septal defect accounts for 6-10% of congenital heart diseases. If detected and treated early, most cases of atrial septal defect are benign and do not affect health.\n This article is expertly advised by Dr. Vu Nang Phuc - Head of Congenital Cardiology Department, Cardiovascular Center of Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City\n\nWhat is atrial septal defect?\nThe English name is Atrial Septal Defect (ASD), this is aÂ congenital heart disease with the appearance of a hole between the two atrium chambers. Atrial septal defect can be located in many different locations on the interatrial septum. Usually, if the atrial septal defect is small, it can close on its own. However, with a large opening, this can lead to dangerous complications. (first)\nAtrial septal defect (TLN) accounts for about 5% to 10% of congenital heart cases\nClassification of atrial septal defect is based on embryology and is divided into 4 types:\nFirst atrial septal defect (ASD-op) also known as primary atrial septal defect: can occur alone but usually occurs in complex congenital heart disease (atrioventricular canal), location low, close to the atrioventricular valve; Second atrial septal defect (ASD-os), also known as secondary atrial septal defect: most common, accounting for up to 70% of cases, can occur alone and is located in the center of the septum. atrium. Secondary atrial septal defect usually ranges in size from 10-30mm; Atrial sinovenous septal defect (ASD-sv): This is a rare condition and has 2 types: Superior vena cava: located just below the opening of the superior vena cava into the right atrium. Superior vena cava-sinus atrial septal defect is often accompanied by abnormal pulmonary venous return. The inferior vena cava is located close to the opening of the inferior vena cava into the right atrium, this type is extremely rare.; Superior vena cava: located just below the opening of the superior vena cava into the right atrium. Superior vena cava-sinus atrial septal defect is often accompanied by abnormal pulmonary venous return.; The inferior vena cava is located close to the opening of the inferior vena cava into the right atrium, this type is extremely rare.\nCoronary sinus atrial septal defect (ASD-cs): due to loss of the coronary sinus ceiling, this case is also rare.\n\nSigns of atrial septal defect\nMany children with atrial septal defects will have no symptoms and remain healthy and lead normal lives. However, if the atrial septal defect is large, the patient may have some of the following signs and symptoms:\nFatigue easily;; Rapid breathing;; Shortness of breath;; Slow growth.; Frequent respiratory infections;; Heart arrhythmia.\nOlder children and adults with this congenital condition may experience migraines. However, there are still not many studies proving whether atrial septal defect is the cause of this condition or not.\n\nThe cause to the illness\nCurrently, the cause of atrial septal defect is unknown, but some congenital heart defects appear to have a genetic component. (2)\nIn addition, some factors during pregnancy can increase the risk of a baby being born with congenital heart defects including:\nRubella infection: Being infected with rubella during the first few months of pregnancy can increase the risk of fetal heart defects.; Using drugs, tobacco, drinking alcohol or exposure to certain stimulants such as cocaine, during pregnancy can harm the development of the fetus.; Diabetes or lupus: Having diabetes or lupus may increase the risk of having a baby with a heart defect.\n\nDiagnostic method\nOnce a child is suspected of having congenital heart disease in general and atrial septal defect in particular, the cardiologist may request the following laboratory tests:\nElectrocardiogram (ECG): records the electrical activity of the heart and shows electrocardiographic abnormalities caused by atrial septal defects; Cardiopulmonary X-ray: may show heart size or changes in your child's lungs due to increased blood flow to the lungs.; Echocardiography: This is considered the main method in diagnosing atrial septal defects. Young patients often use the transthoracic ultrasound method, and for older patients with thick chest walls, the transthoracic ultrasound method is used. Transesophageal echocardiography may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.\n\nIs atrial septal defect dangerous?\nIf the hole is small, it usually will not cause any dangerous complications. Some small openings will close on their own when the child is 1-4 years old. If the hole is large, it can cause serious complications such as:\nRight-sided heart failure; Heart arrhythmia; Increased risk of stroke; Reduce life expectancy\nLess common serious complications are:\nPulmonary hypertension: If a large atrial septal defect is not treated, the increased blood flow to the lungs will increase blood pressure in the pulmonary artery (pulmonary hypertension).; Eisenmenger syndrome: This is the development of pulmonary hypertension due to an untreated congenital heart defect. The disease can cause complications including permanent heart and lung damage.; Atrial septal defects rarely cause complications of pulmonary hypertension and especially Eisenmenger syndrome. Therefore, if detected, other causes of pulmonary hypertension or accompanying primary pulmonary hypertension must be screened.\n\nTreatments\nChoosing atrial septal defect treatment depends on the size of the hole as well as whether the child has other congenital heart defects or not.\nIn the case of a small atrial septal defect, the defect is likely to close spontaneously during childhood. For small holes that cannot close on their own, only need to be monitored and only closed if there is an upstream embolus causing cerebral infarction. Larger atrial septal defects may require cardiac catheterization or cardiac surgery. However, it should not be performed if the child has severe pulmonary hypertension. (3)\nMedication: Medication cannot cure atrial septal defect but can help in some cases. Medications used to treat atrial septal defects are beta blockers (to control heart rate when there is an arrhythmia) and anticoagulants (to reduce the risk of forming blood clots that can cause embolism in some cases). .; Surgery/procedure: Medium to large atrial septal defects will be treated by occluding the defect to prevent future complications. There are 2 intervention methods: open heart surgery (opening the chest to directly access the heart) and cardiac catheterization (inserting a device to close the hole in the interatrial septum).\nSometimes, surgery to close an atrial septal defect can be performed with very small incisions (minimally invasive surgery) and with a robot (robot-assisted cardiac surgery).\nThe surgeon closes the patient's atrial septal defect\n\nPrevention\nIn most cases, there is no way to prevent an atrial septal defect, so if you plan to become pregnant, schedule a visit with your doctor for a pre-pregnancy evaluation: (4)\nAssess your immune status against rubella: If you do not have immune antibodies, you should consider getting vaccinated to prevent the disease. Because this is a live attenuated vaccine, it should be administered at least 3 months before pregnancy; Inform your doctor about your health condition and current medications you are taking. You need to monitor health problems periodically during pregnancy. In addition, the doctor will recommend the medications you are taking before pregnancy and make appropriate adjustments.; If your family has a history of heart disease or genetic disorders, talk to your doctor and get advice about related genetic risks.\n\nHow to care\nScientific living habits and lifestyle will help you control the progression of the disease as well as prevent complications:\nExercise: For patients with atrial septal defect, exercise is not contraindicated. However, in some patients with complications such as arrhythmia, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension... exercise needs to be guided by doctors to ensure safety and effectiveness; Nutrition: Balance a diet with many groups of nutrients, add vegetables, grains and limit cholesterol and fat.; Avoid infection: congenital heart disease can increase the risk of pneumonia and respiratory infections. Therefore, it is necessary to follow the doctor's treatment regimen and use medication exactly as prescribed to ensure the best treatment effectiveness.\nWith the goal of early detection - accurate diagnosis - timely treatment of cardiovascular diseases and risks leading to cardiovascular diseases, Tam Anh General Hospital Heart Center was established, gathering a team of experienced experts. Experience and invest in modern and advanced machinery systems to support doctors in diagnosing and providing the best treatment regimen for patients from infants and children to adults and the elderly...\nTam Anh General Hospital Cardiovascular Center invests in a modern, advanced machinery system to support doctors in diagnosing and providing the best treatment regimen for patients of all subjects, from newborns, children to young children. Adults, the elderly...\nAtrial septal defect is one of the most common congenital heart diseases, which can be cured if detected early and intervened with appropriate methods. Children with atrial septal defect, whether they have had surgery or not, need to have their health monitored until adulthood to detect any abnormalities.",
