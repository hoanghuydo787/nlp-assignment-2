    "content": "Excess estrogen: Signs, causes and prevention\n\nIn both men and women, estrogen is an extremely important hormone. When your body has excess estrogen, you can face many physiological and psychological abnormalities. Over time, this condition will have many negative impacts on the patient's life.\n\nWhat is excess estrogen?\nEstrogen excess is a condition in which estrogen levels increase when the body absorbs too much of this hormone or when progesterone and testosterone levels decrease. Excess estrogen leads to many physiological and psychological symptoms. This is also a premise that increases the risk of developing dangerous diseases such as heart attack, stroke, thyroid disease, breast cancer, ovarian cancer...(1)\nEstrogen is a female sex hormone but is still present in the male body. Women have higher levels of estrogen, while men have more testosterone. For women, estrogen plays an important role in the menstrual cycle and reproductive function. In men, this hormone is also important for sexual function.\n\nThe cause is excess estrogen\nThe body increases the production of estrogen or reduces the production of another hormone such as testosterone or progesterone. This condition leads to an imbalance between sex hormones. (2); Estrogen levels may increase as a result of the medication. Patients using estrogen replacement therapy, a treatment for menopausal symptoms, are more likely to face the side effects of estrogen. Other drugs that also have the potential to increase estrogen levels include hormonal contraceptives, some antibiotics, herbal medicines, phenothiazines.; Have a family history of high estrogen; Some health problems can increase estrogen levels such as obesity, ovarian tumors, liver disease...\n\nSigns of high estrogen levels\nIn women\nWhen estrogen levels increase, women's bodies will appear symptoms such as:\nSwelling, pain in the chest, fibroids in the breast; Flatulence.; Reduced sexual desire; Irregular menstruation, increased symptoms of premenstrual syndrome; Weight gain, especially around the hips and waist; Mood changes, anxiety and panic attacks.; Hair loss.; Cold hands or feet; Memory decline; Fibroids; Difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, fatigue\nIn men\nAlthough estrogen is called the female hormone, men's bodies also make estrogen. The balance between estrogen and testosterone is important for growth and maintenance of sexual function. When these hormones are imbalanced, sexual function is likely to be affected. Symptoms of excess estrogen in men include:\nMale infertility: Estrogen is partly responsible for the production of healthy sperm. If estrogen levels are high, sperm levels are likely to decrease, leading to fertility problems.; Breast enlargement: Estrogen can stimulate tissue growth in the breast. Therefore, when men have too much estrogen, it will lead to larger breasts.; Erectile dysfunction: Men with high levels of estrogen may have difficulty achieving an erection.\n\nComplications can occur when estrogen is high\nExcess estrogen not only affects the patient's reproductive health but is also a prerequisite for the development of diseases such as:\nCauses blood clots to appear; Thyroid disease; Benign breast tumor; Ovarian Cancer; Breast cancer; Stroke; Heart attack; Depression (common in men)\n\nDiagnostic method\nEstrogen levels can be normal or high or low depending on the age and gender of each person. Therefore, in addition to the external manifestations of the body, if you want to know exactly whether your body is suffering from excess estrogen or not, you need to conduct a quantitative test for estradiol (E2) in the blood. If all hormonal indicators exceed normal levels, the patient is at risk of having excess estrogen. (3)\nYour doctor may ask to take your blood or urine for testing. When using blood, testing is performed using serum and plasma. The patient will not need to fast. In some cases, the doctor may ask the patient to stop using drugs that change the results. When using urine as a test sample, the doctor will need to collect the patient's urine within 24 hours and store it in a bottle with boric acid preservative.\n\nTreatment of excess estrogen\nSurgery in cases of ovarian cancer, the doctor may recommend removing the ovaries. Because the ovaries produce most of the estrogen in a woman's body. Doctors may also recommend oophorectomy when the patient is at risk of breast or ovarian cancer.\nUse medications that help reduce estrogen levels; Dietary changes: Patients can reduce estrogen levels through dietary changes. You should eat foods low in fat and high in fiber.; Weight loss can reduce estrogen levels in people who are overweight or obese. This is because fat cells produce extra estrogen.; If the medication causes estrogen levels to rise, your doctor may prescribe a lower dose or alternative treatments.\n\nPrevent excess estrogen\n1. Eat whole grains\nA diet rich in whole grains can reduce estrogen levels in the body and prevent some cancers related to excess estrogen. Whole grains contain abundant fiber, which helps the body absorb cholesterol (a precursor to estrogen). This will help limit the metabolic effects of estrogen production from excess fat tissue in the body, helping to balance estrogen.\n2. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables\nNatural fresh vegetables and fruits help promote natural estrogen balance in the body, reducing excess estrogen levels. Some vegetables you should add to your diet include kiwi, mango, grapes, apples, grapefruit, strawberries, blueberries, bananas, oranges, luffa, sweet potatoes, potatoes, carrots, onions. , olive oilâ€¦\n3. Limit red meat intake\nRed meats contain a lot of protein. When you eat too much of this type of meat, your blood estrogen levels risk increasing, exacerbating hormonal imbalance. You need to stay away from foods that are harmful to your health such as:\nRed meat: Beef, goat meat, lamb, dog meat, horse meat...; Prepared foods: Sausages, bacon, frozen meat...; Refined grain flour: White flour, white rice, white bread...; Artificial sweets: Cakes, pastries, carbonated drinks...\n4. Good weight control\nYou should re-establish a scientific lifestyle. Patients need to work, eat, rest, and exercise at a reasonable frequency. This will help you control your weight, balance your hormones and maintain a toned figure. You should note:\nGet enough sleep, about 6 - 8 hours a day; Provide enough water for the body, at least 2 liters/day; Spend time exercising, at least 30 minutes/day. You can start with simple exercises like walking, jogging, yoga, meditation, cycling...\n5. Do not use alcohol or harmful stimulants\nAlcohol, beer, cigarettes... cause many negative effects on health. Their abuse also makes estrogen imbalance worse and more difficult to control. Therefore, you need to stay away from harmful drinks and stimulants. Instead, patients should supplement beneficial drinks such as yogurt, unsweetened fresh milk, smoothies, fruit juice, etc.\nCenter for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology - Urology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts, Internal Medicine and Surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
