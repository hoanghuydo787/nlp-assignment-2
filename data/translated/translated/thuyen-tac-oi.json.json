This complication occurs suddenly, progresses extremely quickly, the survival rate is very low without any warning signs,\" Associate Professor, Dr. Luu Thi Hong said.\n\nWhat is amniotic embolism?\nAmniotic embolism (also called amniotic embolism) is a condition in which amniotic fluid, fetal cells, hair, fluff or other debris enter the pregnant woman's bloodstream, through the venous system where the placenta is attached, causing produce some allergic-like reactions. This reaction causes acute cardiopulmonary failure and severe bleeding. (first)\nThe disease usually occurs during labor, but can also occur during cesarean section, miscarriage, abdominal trauma, amniocentesis, postpartum or post-cesarean section. The time when amniotic vessel blockage occurs varies depending on the case, statistics show:\n12% of cases occur when the amniotic membrane is intact;; 70% of cases occur during labor;; 11% of cases occurred after vaginal birth;; 19% of cases occurred during cesarean section with or without labor.\nAmniotic embolism can occur at any time during pregnancy\nStatistics on cases of the disease show that although amniotic vascular obstruction is a rare obstetric complication, it is extremely dangerous, with a risk of death of up to 90% in mothers and about 20 - 60% in children. young. Cases that are diagnosed and treated promptly can still save the lives of both mother and fetus, so updating the diagnosis and providing correct and quick treatment is extremely necessary for schools. obstetric complications.\n\nWhat is the cause of amniotic embolism?\nIn a normal state, amniotic fluid will completely stay in the amniotic chamber, not entering the pregnant woman's circulatory system. When the barrier between the amniotic cavity and the pregnant woman's circulation is broken, amniotic fluid will enter the pregnant woman's blood through the cervical canal veins, through the placenta's placenta, through the endometrium or uterus. Injury to the cervix leads to amniotic embolism. However, not all cases of amniotic fluid entering the pregnant woman's circulation cause blockage.\nAssociate Professor, Dr. Luu Thi Hong said that all ages can suffer from blocked amniotic vessels that occur before, during or immediately after birth. Medical records indicate that cases of amniotic embolism in pregnant women have common characteristics such as large fetuses, overdue pregnancies, pregnant women's anxiety, panic, difficulty breathing and vomiting. In addition, some factors that increase the risk of disease include:\nElderly pregnant women: Pregnant women over 35 years old;; Pregnant women with multiple pregnancies or multiple births;; Abnormal placenta: During pregnancy if structures in the uterus develop abnormally;; Pregnant women with pre-eclampsia: Pregnant women with pre-eclampsia, high blood pressure and proteinuria after the 20th week of pregnancy;; Caesarean section, or lower vaginal birth with the intervention of Forceps, traction cupping, or amniocentesis: Using forceps or other cesarean section procedures can break the physical barrier between pregnant woman and fetus. .\nPregnant women with the disease have things in common such as large fetuses, overdue pregnancies, etc.\n\nSymptoms of amniotic embolism\nAssociate Professor, Dr. Luu Thi Hong said: \"The pregnant woman was diagnosed with amniotic embolism, whose initial symptoms were respiratory failure, then suddenly turned pale within a few minutes, accompanied by hypotension. pressure, pulmonary edema, confusion and seizures. At that time, doctors will press the heart and massage the heart outside the chest to help the heart push blood faster, providing oxygen to nourish important organs such as the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, liver, etc. Besides, pregnant women are Supplementing drugs to maintain and support cardiovascular condition, blood transfusion and many other measures to quickly remove the fetus from the mother's body.\" (3)\nAbout 40% of pregnant women, after overcoming the initial symptoms, begin to show signs of bleeding in many places, uterine atony and scattered blood clotting in the blood vessels. There are even pregnant women whose heart stops beating, stops breathing in the first few minutes and dies within 2-3 hours later. (2)\n\nComplications of amniotic embolism are dangerous if not treated promptly\nAccording to Associate Professor, Dr. Luu Thi Hong, \"Amniotic fluid embolism is one of the rare but extremely dangerous obstetric complications due to amniotic fluid flowing into the veins, into the heart, lungs and then to the brain, causing acute respiratory failure.\" . Pregnant women will suddenly turn pale, have cardiovascular collapse, have blood clotting disorders, etc. In particular, the condition will become even more dangerous in pregnant women with diabetes.\"\nAmniotic fluid embolism is more dangerous if the pregnant woman has diabetes\nAssociate Professor, Dr. Luu Thi Hong further shared, when a pregnant woman with amniotic embolism is not identified at the right time, or emergency treatment is not performed quickly and promptly, it can lead to unfortunate consequences. like:\nThe heart and lungs stop working, accompanied by blood clotting disorders or massive blood loss, leading to the pregnant woman suffering from systemic hypoxia, which is especially dangerous when there is a lack of oxygen to the brain.; Hypovolemic shock, liver failure, kidney failure, etc. due to coagulation disorders, excessive blood loss without timely blood replacement. Pregnant women will have to undergo kidney dialysis, blood filtration, and extracorporeal circulation.; Cardiovascular collapse, leading to acute pulmonary edema due to large volumes of blood and fluid transfusion to maintain circulatory volume and protect organs in the body.; Mortality rate is high in both mother and child.\n\nTreatment methods for amniotic embolism during childbirth\nAlthough amniotic fluid embolism during childbirth is a dangerous obstetric complication with a high mortality rate, if promptly diagnosed and treated, both the pregnant woman and the fetus can overcome \"death's door\". Emergency treatment methods include:\nCatheter placement: Place a catheter into one of the arteries to monitor the pregnant woman's blood pressure. At the same time, a tube is placed into a vein in the chest, providing fluids, blood or necessary medicine for the pregnant woman.; Oxygen supply: Place a breathing tube into the trachea to provide oxygen to help the pregnant woman breathe more easily.; Blood transfusion: If the pregnant woman loses a lot of blood, she needs to receive blood transfusion and replacement fluids.; Using medications: Pregnant women may be prescribed medications to improve and support heart function.\nPregnant women need timely diagnosis and emergency treatment to avoid dangerous complications\n\nHow to prevent amniotic embolism?\nStudies show that there is currently no method to prevent this dangerous obstetric complication. However, the development of ultrasound technology and regular prenatal examinations can detect, warn and treat abnormal signs early, preventing unfortunate consequences. (4)\n“The general principle for a healthy pregnancy and safe birth lies in good pregnancy management. Pregnant women need to have regular check-ups as prescribed by doctors to detect risky pregnancies early, take timely and effective treatment measures, and ensure the health of both mother and fetus\" - Associate Professor. Dr. Luu Thi Hong recommended.\nGet regular prenatal checkups as prescribed by your doctor to have a healthy pregnancy and safe birth\nNot only are they professionally skilled and experienced, Tam Anh General Hospital doctors have successfully treated millions of dangerous obstetric complications such as pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, hemorrhage and especially twin blood transfusion. In particular, doctors at Tam Anh General Hospital are dedicated and accompany pregnant women through the gentlest labor, fully enjoying the joy of welcoming a new member.\nHow many types of complications are there in pregnancy and at what stage does the risk occur?\nFor advice and to schedule a maternity health examination at Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nHotline: 024 3872 3872 or Fanpage of Tam Anh General Hospital; Address: 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep Street, Bo De Ward, Long Bien District, Hanoi City\nAbove is all the information you need to know about amniotic fluid embolism in women.
