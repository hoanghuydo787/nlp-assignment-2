    "content": "Prediabetes (Prediabetes): Causes, signs\n\nPrediabetes can progress to type 2 diabetes if you do not adjust your diet and healthy lifestyle. People need to have regular health checks to detect diseases early and prevent prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.\n\nWhat is prediabetes?\nPrediabetes is a condition in which blood sugar is higher than normal (in normal people, blood sugar levels before meals range from 90-130 mg/dl and after meals are below 180 mg/dl) but not high enough for a doctor to diagnose. Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Currently, Vietnam has about 5.3 million people with pre-diabetes and it is expected that 2/3 of them (accounting for 70%) will turn into diabetes by 2045. (1)\nPrediabetes does not have a major impact on health; However, without lifestyle changes, adults and children with prediabetes are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. At that time, the disease severely affects the heart, blood vessels, eyes, and kidneys. Detecting pre-diabetes is also an opportunity to help you adjust your lifestyle and improve your health in time to prevent the disease from progressing to diabetes.\n\nSigns of prediabetes\nPrediabetes often has no symptoms. In some people, prediabetes manifests itself through the following signs:\nThe skin on some parts of the body such as the neck, armpits, and groin is dark; Drink lots of water, urinate many times a day.; Faded or limited vision; The body is often tired and has difficulty concentrating, but the cause is unknown.\nSigns of pre-diabetes are often easily confused with other health conditions, so people should have regular health checks to screen and detect the disease early, thereby adjusting their lifestyle. Eat, drink and exercise appropriately.\n\nCauses of prediabetes\nModern medicine has not found the exact cause of prediabetes, however, genetic factors play an important role. Another cause is a metabolic disorder in the body that causes glucose to \"stay\" and not be processed properly.\nMedicine can explain as follows, glucose is the body's main source of energy, created from the foods we eat every day. During that process, insulin (produced by the pancreas) plays a role in transporting and releasing glucose to cells. Excess glucose is stored as glycogen in the liver. Between meals or while sleeping, the liver converts glycogen into glucose through a process called glycogenesis, which helps the body maintain a steady flow of blood sugar to fuel cells. If the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, the cells cannot use insulin effectively, and the flow of glucose into the cells will be interrupted. At this time you are constantly hungry, thirsty, constantly eating and drinking but your body has no energy for life activities.\nEating a lot of sweet foods, starches, etc. can easily cause prediabetes.\nIn addition, people with the following factors are also at risk of prediabetes: (2)\nAfter 45 years old.; Having a parent or sibling in the family with type 2 diabetes; Men have a waist greater than 101.6 cm and women have a waist greater than 88.9 cm. When the waist circumference is larger than normal, the body faces the risk of insulin resistance. (3); Use a lot of red meat (beef, buffalo meat, beef, lamb, goat meat, venison...), processed foods, sugary drinks.; Eating less fruits, vegetables, legumes and being lazy to exercise; Overweight and obesity, especially belly fat, is the main risk factor for prediabetes. If the area between the muscles and around the abdomen has a lot of fatty tissue, it is more likely to be insulin resistant.; The body has high cholesterol, high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol and high LDL cholesterol.; If you have diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes), you and your baby are at higher risk of prediabetes.; Women with polycystic ovary syndrome often experience irregular menstruation, excessive hair growth, obesity, and metabolic disorders in the body.; People with sleep apnea are at risk of insulin resistance, which can easily lead to prediabetes.; Smoking can increase insulin resistance. People with prediabetes who do not quit smoking will continue to face the risk of type 2 diabetes. Smoking also increases the risk of other diabetes complications such as: pneumonia, tuberculosis, kidney failure,...\nWhen having the above signs, people should have regular check-ups with a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology - Diabetes to have tests performed, thereby monitoring their health and taking preventive measures. Doctors in the Department of Endocrinology - Diabetes, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City have extensive professional knowledge and experience helping patients detect pre-diabetes and prevent it at an early stage. Thereby, avoiding the progression to type 2 diabetes.\nOverweight and obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is the main risk factor for prediabetes.\n\nIs prediabetes dangerous?\nPre-diabetes can progress to type 2 diabetes if the patient does not adjust their diet, live a healthy lifestyle, and exercise regularly. Even if it has not progressed to type 2 diabetes, with a metabolic disorder, you can have high blood pressure, blurred vision, increased bad cholesterol, damage to the heart, blood vessels, and stroke. , fatty liver, eye and kidney damage. Studies show that prediabetes is linked to unexplained heart attacks.\n\nHow long does it take for prediabetes to become diabetes?\nPrediabetes can progress to diabetes or not depending on a scientific diet and good blood sugar control. However, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said: without a plan to adjust diet and lifestyle, 37% of people with diabetes will develop type 2 diabetes after 4 years. If you change your lifestyle, the time it takes for a person with prediabetes to develop into diabetes is 10 years. Even if you follow a healthy diet and have regular health check-ups, you can completely reverse prediabetes. (4)\n\nDiagnosis and treatment methods\nTam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City brings together doctors specializing in Endocrinology - Diabetes who are experienced, skilled, and dedicated to caring for each case. In particular, doctors who have worked at leading hospitals in Vietnam. With in-depth medical knowledge and extensive practical experience, the doctor will recognize suspicious signs and prescribe the patient for diagnostic tests. For example, the patient's blood is taken for a fasting plasma glucose test and fasting for at least 8 hours before the test.\nRegular health checks help detect prediabetes early, allowing for timely treatment.\nIf the blood sugar test result is less than 100 mg/dL, it is normal. (5)\nIf your blood sugar is 126 mg/dL or higher, you have diabetes. At this time, you will continue to check your blood sugar with an oral glucose tolerance test. After testing your fasting blood sugar, you are given a sugar solution to drink.\nAfter 2 hours, medical staff will take blood for further testing (also known as any blood sugar test, post-meal blood sugar test).\nIf blood sugar is below 140 mg/dL, it is normal.; If your blood sugar is between 140 and 199mg/dL, you have prediabetes; If your blood sugar is 200 mg/dL or higher, you have diabetes.\nIn addition, you will have an HbA1C test. This is a blood test that shows the average blood sugar level over the past 3 months, often used to check whether a patient has good blood sugar control or not. HbA1C is also used to diagnose prediabetes.\nIf HbA1C is below 5.6%, it is normal.\n– If HbA1C is from 5.7 to 6.4%, it is prediabetes.\n– If HbA1C is 6.5% or higher, you have diabetes.\nYour doctor may ask you to test your blood sugar again to confirm.\nChildren are also at risk of prediabetes. According to the American Diabetes Association, children aged 10 years and older who fall into the following cases should have their blood sugar checked periodically to detect pre-diabetes early and prevent it promptly. Specifically:\nOverweight, obese; Having a family member with type 2 diabetes; The child's mother had gestational diabetes during pregnancy.\nIf a child at high risk for prediabetes has normal blood sugar results, the American Diabetes Association recommends retesting at least every 3 years.\n\nHow to prevent prediabetes\nDiabetes is one of the leading causes of death in the world. In 2021, there will be 537 million people with diabetes in the world. Every 5 seconds, a person with diabetes dies. Vietnam alone has more than 3.5 million patients, expected to increase to 6.5 million cases by 2045. Therefore, when pre-diabetes is detected, you should see an Endocrinologist - Diabetologist as well as a doctor. Choose a hospital with modern equipment and machinery to accurately assess your health condition and adjust your diet. This is the last chance for change before prediabetes progresses to diabetes. Here's what you should do to reverse prediabetes:\nFollow a healthy diet: choose foods with good fats and healthy nutrients such as vegetable oils, legumes, whole grains, fish, and fruits with a low glycemic index (cherry, grape, apple, avocado, grapefruit, banana, guava,...), green vegetables, green tea.\nEating lots of vegetables and fruits helps reduce the risk of progressing from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes.\nExperts say that using healthy foods plays a very important role in preventing prediabetes from turning into type 2 diabetes. There is no correct diet for all people with prediabetes. Diabetes because each person has a different constitution and physical condition. If you need more information about your diet, see a Nutritionist Tiet Diet for a thorough consultation.\nWeight loss: overweight and obese people should lose weight using healthy methods using the Mediterranean diet (a diet that encourages eating foods: fish, fruits and vegetables, beans and whole grains; not encourage eating more meat, dairy products or sweets); The DASH diet (a diet promoted by the US-based National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to prevent and control hypertension, encourages the use of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy foods); Vegetarian diet,... Just lose 5% - 10% of your body weight, you have significantly reduced the risk of prediabetes progressing to diabetes.; Exercise: you should walk 30 minutes a day or perform gentle movements. Exercise increases the transport of oxygen and nutrients to cells, making the cardiovascular system as well as the body's metabolism more effective. In addition, the process of exercise helps stimulate substances in the brain to help you relax mentally, reduce stress, anxiety... thereby helping you sleep well and sleep deeply.; Stop using stimulants and foods high in carbohydrates such as alcoholic beverages, carbonated soft drinks, fast food, processed foods, etc.\nDetecting prediabetes is an opportunity for you to prevent type 2 diabetes. Therefore, you should adjust your lifestyle, diet, and healthy diet. At the same time, you should see a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes to monitor your health and ensure you successfully overcome prediabetes.",
