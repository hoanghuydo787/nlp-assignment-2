    "content": "Nocturia: Causes, signs and prevention\n\nNocturia is a secret obsession of many patients. If this condition is not resolved soon, it will cause insomnia, fatigue, discomfort, and serious health deterioration. What disease is frequent nocturnal urination and what is the cause? Once you determine the correct cause, you will have an effective way to overcome this unpleasant situation.\n\nWhat is nocturia?\nA healthy adult's bladder can hold about 300 - 400ml of urine. When full, the bladder will stimulate transmission to the brain to create a urination reflex. During night sleep, the nerves will inhibit the bladder from contracting to create a urination reflex, helping to maintain good sleep.\nNocturia is a condition in which the patient frequently wakes up more than once to urinate. The incidence of the disease increases with age, especially in people over 50 years old. Therefore, when you wake up to urinate more than twice during the night, you should quickly see a doctor. Because this may be an initial symptom of kidney disease or some physiological function problem.\n\nSymptoms of nocturia\nA normal person can sleep 6-8 hours, without waking up in the middle of the night to urinate. People with nocturia will wake up more than once during sleep to urinate. If this condition lasts long, it can make the patient feel tired or even physically weak. When the cause comes from a disease, if you delay treatment, you can face dangerous complications from the disease.\n\nWhy do we urinate frequently at night?\n1. Nocturia due to fluid imbalance\nFrequent urination day and night\nIf there is a fluid imbalance in the body that causes urine output to increase above 40ml/kg/24 hours, the patient may have:\nDrinking too much water or alcohol; Have diabetes.; Hypercalcemia.; Chronic renal failure.\nFrequent urination at night\nNocturia is defined as nocturnal urine volume greater than 35% of the total 24-hour urine volume throughout the day. Causes include:\nDrink a lot of water and alcohol in the evening; Use diuretics close to bedtime.; Change in antidiuretic hormone secretion; Venous blood stasis causes edema; Congestive heart failure causes nocturnal fluid redistribution.\n2. Nocturia due to neurological problems\nAn adult's bladder capacity can hold 300 - 400ml of urine. When urine is excreted from the kidneys to fill the bladder, the body will have a reflex to urinate. Meanwhile, the bladder is controlled by the brain, spinal cord segments S1 and S2, and the peripheral nervous system. Therefore, nerve-related problems can also affect bladder function, leading to nocturia.\nSome neurological diseases\nNeurological disorders that often cause urinary retention, urinary incontinence, frequent urination or nocturia include:\nSpinal cord compression syndrome.; Scattered sclerosis in clusters; Parkinson's.\nIf a woman over 60 years old frequently experiences urinary retention after eliminating the cause of bladder obstruction, the doctor has reason to suspect neurological diseases.\nSleep apnea\nSleep disorders can be the cause of nocturia. Specifically, sleep apnea has the potential to increase the frequency of nocturia. Therefore, treating sleep apnea will help improve nocturia.\nYou may be interested in: Sleep disorders in children\n3. Nocturia due to lower urinary tract disorders\nThe urine concentration function helps you sleep through the night without interruption. This function will become less effective with age. In addition, prostate enlargement and urinary problems can also cause inflammation, weakening the bladder and poor urine retention, thereby increasing nocturia. Specific causes include:\nUrethral disease causes obstruction of flow from the bladder.; Overactive bladder.; Too sensitive due to illness or pregnancy.; Interstitial cystitis.; Urinary tract infection.\n4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia is a common cause of nocturia. The disease affects 50% of men between the ages of 51 and 60. This rate increases to 90% in patients over 80 years old.\nThe prostate gland surrounds the urethra, so if it becomes enlarged, it will block the flow. The bladder wall is also thickened, making it difficult to empty urine. Patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia should see a doctor as soon as possible to better control the condition and improve nocturia.\n5. Effects of some drugs\nThe effects of some drugs can cause nocturnal polyuria, especially diuretics (blood pressure treatment, peripheral treatment of feet and ankles). Treatment medications that often cause nocturia include Furosemide, Demeclocycline, Methoxyflurane, Lithium, Propoxyphene, Phenytoin.\n\nComplications of nocturia\nIf the frequency of nocturia is high but there is no timely intervention, the patient may face complications such as:\nNeurological effects: Urinating 2-3 times during the night causes prolonged insomnia and poor sleep. Over time, the nervous system will be affected, memory will decline, and fatigue will occur when waking up in the morning.; Increased risk of heart disease: Frequent nocturia in the elderly increases the risk of blood pressure and cardiovascular disease due to having to wake up many times and interrupting sleep.; Long-term damage: Nocturia is caused by diseases related to the prostate, uterine fibroids, diabetes or kidney disease. If treatment is delayed, it can cause irreversible damage, seriously affecting health. .\n\nDiagnosis method of nocturia syndrome\nPatients should record information during the day such as what they drank, how much water they drank, and how often they urinated. When you go to the doctor, you need to give all this information to the doctor. In addition, the patient may be asked to answer some questions such as:\nWhen did nocturia begin?; How many times do I have to wake up to pee?; Does the body produce less urine than before?; Are there any other unusual signs?; What medications are you using?; Is there a history of bladder problems or diabetes?\nIn addition, the doctor may prescribe the patient to undergo tests including:\nMeasure blood sugar (determine whether you have diabetes or not).; Blood urea test.; uid deprivation test; Urine culture.; Ultrasound, CT scan.; Cystoscopy\n\nHow to treat nocturia\nDepending on the cause of nocturia, your doctor will provide appropriate treatment, specifically:\nDue to the effects of medication: Patients should use medication earlier in the day.; Due to sleep apnea: Patients are recommended to see a sleep specialist or cardiologist.; Due to disease: Nocturia can be a sign of serious disease such as diabetes, urinary tract infection... Cases of nocturia due to disease will often improve when the disease is well controlled.\n\nHow to prevent nocturia\n1. Diet\nLimit drinking water (at least 2 hours) before bed.; Avoid using diuretic drinks in the evening such as alcohol, coffee, tea...; During dinner, avoid eating salty foods and limit eating fruits with a lot of water such as grapefruit, watermelon, oranges...\n2. Sleep habits\nPractice the habit of urinating before going to bed, elevating your legs when sleeping.; Relax and keep your mind at ease before going to sleep.; If a family member is sick, prepare a convenient path from the bed to the bathroom to avoid falls.\nIn addition, patients should increase exercise to control weight and avoid overweight and obesity. If you are using medications to regulate blood pressure, you should talk to your doctor about the diuretic side effects of the medications. Diuretics will increase the frequency of urination if taken in the evening.\nNocturia causes the patient to wake up many times, greatly affecting sleep quality and mental health. This can also be a warning bell for many dangerous diseases. If this condition persists and does not improve, you should quickly see a doctor for timely advice and treatment.\nThe Center for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts in internal medicine and surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
