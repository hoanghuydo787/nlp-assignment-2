    "content": "Type 1 diabetes: Causes, symptoms and diagnosis\n\nThe effective way to treat type 1 diabetes is to use insulin appropriately, maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle to well control blood sugar levels, helping to prevent complications of the disease.\n\nWhat is type 1 diabetes (type 1 diabetes)?\nType 1 diabetes (also known as type 1 diabetes) is a pathological condition that occurs when the pancreas cannot produce or produces very little insulin, leading to serious endogenous insulin deficiency. Insulin is a hormone that helps bring glucose in the blood into cells in the body to create energy for cell activity. Without insulin, glucose in the blood cannot enter the cells and gradually accumulates in the blood, leading to increased blood sugar, while the cells are \"energy hungry\" because they cannot receive glucose. Prolonged high blood sugar levels will harm the body and cause many symptoms and complications of diabetes. Therefore, type 1 diabetes was once called insulin-dependent diabetes. The disease is often diagnosed in children or young people, so it is also called juvenile diabetes, but the disease can also begin at any age. (first)\nType 1 diabetes is less common than type 2. Statistics show that type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5-10% of people with diabetes.\n\nCause of type 1 diabetes\nType 1 diabetes accounts for 10% of the total number of people with diabetes. The cause of type 1 diabetes is the destruction of beta cells in the pancreas, leaving the body with no or very little insulin. This leads to the patient's blood sugar not being converted into energy.\nOf the causes of type 1 diabetes, 95% of cases are due to autoimmune mechanisms (also known as type 1A) and 5% have unknown causes (also known as type 1B). In type 1A, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys cells responsible for producing insulin in the pancreas. Patients must depend on external sources of insulin.\nAlthough the risk factors for type 1 diabetes are still being researched, based on the number of cases, scientists note the general situation: when a family member has someone with type 1 diabetes. 1, the remaining members are also at risk of getting the disease, or the patient is exposed to certain viruses... leading to the destruction of the immune system, which is also a risk factor for disease.\n\nIs type 1 diabetes hereditary?\nType 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction (the body's cells are attacked by the body's own immune system). This reaction destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, cells called beta cells. This process can occur for months to years before the onset of symptoms.\nAnother condition called secondary diabetes is similar to type 1 diabetes, but the beta cells are destroyed by other causes, such as diseases or injuries to the pancreas, rather than from the underlying cause. autoimmune cause. (2)\nThe main cause of type 1 diabetes is not fully understood. Although type 1 diabetes is not classified as a genetic disorder, a person is more likely to develop type 1 diabetes if an immediate relative such as a parent or sibling has the disease. This.\nResearchers believe that family history plays an important role. Many people carry certain genes (passed from parents to children) that make them more likely to develop type 1 diabetes. However, not all of them have the disease even if there is a genetic factor. An environmental trigger, such as a viral infection, may play an important role in the development of type 1 diabetes. Diet and lifestyle habits do not lead to type 1 diabetes. .\n\nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes\nThe disease often progresses months to years before the first symptoms are noticed. Diabetes symptoms can form and begin in a short period of time from a few weeks to a few months. Once symptoms appear, they can be quite severe. Include:\nFrequent urination: the body increases the excretion of excess sugar in the blood through the kidneys, leading to frequent urination.; Excessive thirst: when there is a lot of sugar in the blood, the body will urinate more to eliminate the sugar. This leads to dehydration, dry mouth, thirst.; Drink lots of water: when the body is dehydrated, it will try to compensate by drinking lots of water, especially soft drinks.; Weight loss/Feeling hungry quickly (especially after eating). When glucose leaves the body through the urine, it carries calories with it. This explains why many people with high blood sugar tend to lose weight or experience hunger. Dehydration is also one of the factors causing weight loss; Tired; Blurred vision; Frequent skin, urinary tract, or vaginal infections; Irritability or mood changes; New enuresis appears in children who did not have it before\nMore serious warning signs in people with type 1 diabetes include:\nIrritability, confusion; Rapid deep breathing (Kussmaul breathing); The breath has a fruity smell (the smell of ripe apples...); Stomach-ache; Loss of consciousness (rare)\n\nSubjects at risk of type 1 diabetes\nThe disease affects both sexes equally. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes are not as clear as type 2 diabetes. However, people with one of the following factors have a higher risk of developing the disease:\nWhite people are more likely to develop type 1 diabetes than other groups\nUnder 20 years old; White race; Have a parent or sibling with type 1 diabetes\n\nDiagnosis of type 1 diabetes\nA fasting blood test will help diagnose diabetes. Cases of blood sugar testing using rapid tests need to be re-tested to ensure accurate results. (3)\nIf type 1 diabetes is suspected, the doctor will order a blood test to look for autoantibodies. The appearance of these antibodies shows that the body is attacking its own cells and is often found in people with type 1 diabetes but not type 2.\nIn addition, blood or urine can be tested for ketones, which are substances created when the body breaks down lipids to create energy because it cannot use glucose.\n\nDangerous complications of type 1 diabetes\nOver time, uncontrolled type 1 diabetes can cause complications in major organs in the body, including the heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. Maintaining normal blood sugar levels can reduce the risk of many complications.\nComplications of diabetes can lead to disability or even be life-threatening.\n1. Heart and blood vessel disease\nDiabetes increases the risk of certain heart and blood vessel problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke, narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis). and hypertension.\n2. Neuropathy (nerve damage)\nHigh levels of sugar in the blood over a long period of time can damage the walls of blood vessels (usually capillaries) that feed the nerves. This is especially common in the legs with tingling, numbness, burning or pain. Symptoms often start at the tips of the toes or fingers and spread upward. Poorly controlled blood sugar can cause patients to gradually lose feeling in their limbs and gradually increase the effects over time.\nDamage to the nerves that affect the digestive system can cause problems such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. In men, it can lead to erectile dysfunction.\n3. Diabetic kidney disease\nDiabetes can damage the small blood vessels in the kidneys. Severe cases can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease. At this time, the patient needs treatment with dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n4. Eye damage\nType 1 diabetes can damage the blood vessels in the retina, or diabetic retinopathy, which can lead to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision-affecting conditions such as cataracts and glaucoma.\n5. Diabetic feet\nDamage to the nerves in the feet or reduced blood flow to the feet due to narrowed blood vessels increases the risk of certain foot complications. If not treated properly, cuts and blisters can become severely infected, even leading to amputation of a toe, foot or leg (amputation).\n6. Skin and mouth infections\nPeople with diabetes may be more susceptible to skin and mouth infections than people without the disease. Infection occurs due to bacterial and fungal infections. Gum disease and dry mouth may also occur.\n7. Complications during pregnancy\nHigh blood sugar can be dangerous for both mother and baby. The risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and birth defects increases when blood sugar is not well controlled. For pregnant women, diabetes increases the risk of ketoacidosis, eye problems caused by diabetes (retinopathy) are often worse during pregnancy, high blood pressure due to pregnancy and preeclampsia.\n\nType 1 diabetes treatment method\nCurrently, there is no effective way to prevent type 1 diabetes, but the disease can be successfully treated by:\nFollow a healthy lifestyle according to your doctor's instructions.; Good control of blood sugar levels.; Periodic health check.; Access knowledge and support on how to self-manage diabetes.\nRegularly check blood sugar levels to control the condition\n1. Insulin\nFor type 1 diabetes, patients need to use insulin to control blood sugar levels and provide energy for the body. Can be used as an injection or as an automatic insulin pump. Inhaled insulin is also being studied. Patients cannot take insulin in pill form because stomach acid will destroy the drug before it enters the bloodstream. The doctor will review and recommend the most effective type and dosage of insulin for the patient. The doctor will also explain the different types of insulin and their characteristics so that the patient can understand.\nPatients also need to check blood sugar levels regularly. Your doctor will advise you on how often to test and target blood sugar levels. Keeping blood sugar levels as close to target levels as possible will help prevent or delay diabetes-related complications.\nYou may not know: Common groups of drugs used to treat diabetes\n2. Change your lifestyle\nStress can make managing diabetes more difficult, including controlling blood sugar levels and providing daily care.\nRegular physical activity, getting enough sleep, maintaining relaxation exercises, and consulting a doctor are the remedies to control stress. Regular exercise plays an important role in blood sugar control. It is necessary to balance insulin dosage, meals and exercise intensity accordingly.\n3. Diet\nIt is necessary to have knowledge about foods and the effects of each type on blood sugar. From there, you can build a healthy eating plan to help stabilize blood sugar. Come in for advice from a diabetes specialist and nutritionist.\nTo get advice and book an appointment with leading endocrinology and diabetes experts at Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nSome symptoms of type 1 diabetes are similar to other diseases. Therefore, if you suspect you have the disease, you should see a doctor to have your blood sugar tested. If left untreated, diabetes can lead to very serious health problems, even death.",
