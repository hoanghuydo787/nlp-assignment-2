    "content": "Urinary incontinence: Causes, symptoms, treatment and prevention medications\n\nUrinary incontinence is a common condition that many people encounter, greatly affecting daily activities, psychology and quality of life in general. This problem comes from many different causes, and can be effectively improved if diagnosed and treated early. However, in the opposite case, the condition can progress to many serious complications.\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence?\nUrinary incontinence is a condition in which urine leaks uncontrollably when coughing, sneezing or the feeling of needing to urinate occurs suddenly and continuously to the point of not being able to react in time. This problem makes the patient feel very uncomfortable, significantly affecting daily activities.\nSpecifically, the urinary system is composed of kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. The parts will coordinate to perform the task of filtering, containing and removing waste from the body. Initially, urine moves down the ureters and is stored in the bladder. When it is full, the brain will immediately send a signal to urinate. At this time, the sphincter opens, waste leaves the bladder and flows freely out of the body through the urethra.\nThis is the normal process when the urinary system operates smoothly, allowing psychological preparation before urinating. On the contrary, urinary incontinence occurs when these organs malfunction due to a number of different reasons.\nMany myths still believe that this is a natural part of the aging process and cannot be avoided. In fact, urinary incontinence tends to increase with age, but there are effective treatments to improve the condition.\n\nTypes of urinary incontinence\nUrinary incontinence is classified into the following main groups: (1)\n1. Urinary incontinence\nThis group is characterized by signs of needing to urinate immediately, which occur suddenly and intensely, leaving the patient unable to react in time, leading to urinary incontinence. Urgent urination can result from an overactive bladder. Accordingly, the core causes are often due to nerve damage, infection, low estrogen levels after menopause, being overweight, weak pelvic muscles, consuming caffeine and alcohol...\n2. Stress urinary incontinence\nThis is a condition where you leak urine when you cough, sneeze, laugh, run, jump or lift objects. The main cause is weak pelvic floor muscles, which no longer effectively support other organs in the pelvic area as usual. At this time, some body activities can also put pressure on the bladder, leading to urine leakage. This is often a common problem for postpartum women or men who have undergone prostate surgery.\n3. Urinary incontinence due to overflow\nThis condition occurs when urine is not completely discharged from the bladder after each bowel movement, and instead leaks urine more frequently over time. This is a common problem in people with chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, diabetes, stroke... or men with large prostate size.\n4. Mixed urinary incontinence\nThis type of urinary incontinence is a combination of many different problems that lead to urinary leakage. To improve symptoms, patients need to contact a doctor to determine the exact cause, thereby finding effective solutions.\n\nSymptoms of urinary incontinence\nThe main symptom of urinary incontinence is urine leakage that is difficult to control, continuously or sporadically dripping in large or small amounts. Depending on each type, the manifestations will be different but in general they are easy to recognize by some of the following characteristic signs:\nUrinary incontinence when coughing, laughing, sneezing, exercising.; Frequent urination throughout the day and/or night.\n\nCauses of urinary incontinence\nUrinary incontinence can stem from daily habits, hidden illnesses or physical problems. Specifically as follows: (2)\n1. Temporary urinary incontinence\nCertain foods, drinks, and medications have the potential to stimulate the bladder and increase urine production, including:\nWine.; Caffeine.; Gas drink.; Artificial sweeteners.; Chocolate.; Chilli.; Foods containing a lot of spices, sugar, acids, especially citrus fruits; Medicines: drugs related to the heart, blood pressure, sedatives, muscle relaxants.; The body consumes too much Vitamin C.\nIn addition, temporary urinary incontinence can also stem from a number of diseases such as:\nConstipation: The rectum is located near the bladder and connected by many nerves. When constipated, hard stools will compress tightly in the rectum, causing pressure on the nerves, increasing the frequency of urination.; Urinary tract infection: Infection can irritate the bladder, causing an increased need to urinate and incontinence.\n2. Continuous and frequent urinary incontinence\nContinuous and persistent urinary incontinence can be directly related to physical changes, including:\nPregnancy: During pregnancy, hormonal changes as well as fetal development can lead to urinary incontinence; Normal birth: Vaginal birth causes weakening of some muscles and nerves related to the bladder, causing the pelvic floor to drop. At this time, the bladder, rectum, uterus or small intestine may be pushed out of normal position, increasing the risk of urinary incontinence.; Age: Over time, aging of the bladder muscle can reduce its ability to store urine. In addition, contractions also occur more frequently in old age.; Menopause: Entering menopause, women's bodies produce less estrogen than usual (this is a hormone that helps maintain the health of the bladder and urethra). This decline can make urinary incontinence worse.; Prostate enlargement: In older men, urinary incontinence often comes from prostate enlargement; Prostate cancer: Prostate cancer in men, if left untreated, can also become the cause of urinary incontinence.; Obstruction: A tumor anywhere along the urinary tract can block the normal flow of urine, leading to incontinence. In addition, urinary stones also cause similar effects.; Autonomic nervous system disorders: Multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke, brain tumor or spinal injury can interfere with nerve signals involved in bladder control, leading to urinary incontinence.\n\nFactors that increase the risk of disease\nUrinary incontinence is more likely to occur in people in risk groups, including:\nGender: Women are at higher risk than men, especially during pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause.; Age: As you get older, the muscles in the bladder and urethra gradually age, directly affecting the ability to hold urine, leading to urinary incontinence.; Overweight: Being overweight increases pressure on the bladder and surrounding muscles, causing weakness, allowing urine to escape uncontrollably when coughing or sneezing.; Smoking habit; Genetic.; People with neurological diseases or diabetes.\n\nComplications of urinary incontinence\nIn the long term, if urinary incontinence is not treated completely, it will lead to the following two serious complications:\nSkin problems: rashes, infections, ulcers due to skin being constantly wet.; Urinary tract infections recur many times.\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nTo limit unwanted complications, when experiencing urinary incontinence, patients should contact their doctor early for an accurate diagnosis. Especially when some of the following serious signs appear:\nUrinary incontinence occurs continuously and frequently; Urinary incontinence increases the risk of falls in older people when they constantly have to go to the toilet in a hurry.; Suspicion is a sign of some other underlying disease.; Urinary incontinence seriously affects psychology and daily activities.\n\nDiagnostic methods\nSome commonly used methods of diagnosing urinary incontinence include: (3)\nBladder diary: The patient records the amount of water drunk, the time of urination, the amount of urine excreted and the number of times of urinary incontinence.; Physical examination: The doctor will conduct a vaginal examination, check the activity of the pelvic floor muscles (for women) and a rectal examination to determine prostate enlargement (for men).; Urine analysis: This test is conducted to determine infection or other abnormal signs (if any).; Blood tests: Blood tests are conducted to evaluate kidney function.; Post-void residual measurement (PVR): This method accurately determines the amount of urine remaining in the bladder after urination.; Pelvic ultrasound: Pelvic ultrasound is conducted to detect abnormalities (if any) through the images obtained.; Urodynamic testing: This method helps test the urine storage and expulsion function of the bladder as well as the bladder neck sphincter.; Cystoscopy: A tube with a small camera will be inserted into the urethra to check for abnormalities inside the urinary tract.\n\nHow to treat urinary incontinence\nDepending on the level of urinary incontinence, the doctor will prescribe appropriate treatment methods to effectively improve the condition. Some possible methods include:\nMedications to treat urinary incontinence: Some medications have the ability to reduce uncontrolled urine leakage, helping to stabilize contractions when the bladder is overactive. Commonly prescribed treatment drugs include: Oxybutynin, Oxybutynin XL, Oxybutynin TDDS, Tolterodine, Solifenacin, Fesoterodine, Darifenacin...; Control symptoms by making positive lifestyle changes and improving a healthy diet.; Botulinum injection: This method helps relax muscles, reducing urinary incontinence; Using an artificial urethral sphincter: This device is used for men, closing the urethra when not urinating, often used mainly after prostate cancer surgery.; Placing a urethral lift band: This is a highly effective method in treating stress urinary incontinence in women.\n\nMeasures to prevent urinary incontinence\nUrinary incontinence can be proactively prevented by changing living habits, eating and exercising actively. Some useful solutions can be referred to as:\nMaintain a reasonable weight level.; Practicing some pelvic floor exercises is beneficial.; Avoid using bladder stimulants, such as: caffeine, alcohol, acidic foods...; Build a menu rich in fiber to prevent constipation; No smoking.; Complete treatment of diseases related to the bladder, urinary tract infections...\nCenter for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology - Urology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts, Internal Medicine and Surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
