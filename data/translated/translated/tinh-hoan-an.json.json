    "content": "Undescended testicles: Congenital disease causing high infertility\n\nUndescended testicles are often detected in baby boys at birth, and a small number of adult men have this condition. Early detection and treatment is necessary to avoid affecting the patient's health and fertility in the future.\n\nWhat is an undescended testicle?\nUndescended testicles are a condition in which a child is born in which one or both testicles do not descend into the scrotum or are located in a location other than the scrotum. During the fetal period, the fetus's two testicles are located behind the kidneys. When the fetus is about 8 weeks old, the two testicles have moved from the abdomen through the groin, down to the scrotum before the baby is born. About 10% of boys have hidden conditions in both testicles.(1)\nIn boys at birth, the incidence is about 3 - 4%. This rate increases when the newborn is underweight, has twins, or is born prematurely. Many cases of undescended testicles after birth will continue to move to the scrotum before the child is 3 months old. However, when a child is 6 months old, if the testicles are still not in the scrotum, it will be difficult for the testicles to move down on their own and requires appropriate treatment.\nThe disease is often detected in children with hormonal disorders, birth defects or genetic abnormalities. In some cases, children are born with undescended testicles but the cause cannot be determined.\nUndescended testicles are usually smaller than normal and the parenchyma is soft. According to research conducted in the US by Anne Suskind and colleagues, boys with hidden testicles often have smaller diameters of seminiferous tubules and higher levels of testicular fibrosis. This histological change has the potential to affect sperm, causing male infertility. When only one testicle is undescended, the patient can still have children. However, patients may face many health risks due to the risk of testicular cancer and a number of other risks.\nIf a man has undescended testicles on both sides, the risk of infertility will be very high. Their semen test results often show no sperm. Some patients cannot even have sex due to severe hormone deficiency. Men with undescended testicles often combine with other birth defects.\nIf not treated promptly and properly, people with undescended testicles are likely to face health risks such as testicular cancer, testicular torsion, testicular trauma or psychological and physiological damage because of lack of treatment. having or having only one testicle under the scrotum. There are two types of undescended testicles, specifically:\nPalpable form: When touching, the testicles can be felt at the inguinal canal, testicular springs.; Non-palpable form: Testicles are located in the deep inguinal ring, in the abdominal cavity. When touched, the testicles will not be felt.\n\nCauses of undescended testicles\nCommon causes of undescended testicles are:\nDisorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis: Hypopituitarism causes gonadotropin deficiency, causing undescended testicles and micropenis; Abnormal testosterone synthesis due to lack of enzymes 17α-hydroxylase, 5α-reductase... This causes the testicles to not develop normally.; Syndrome of reduced sensing ability of androgen receptors: Because of reduced sensing ability of androgen receptors, even if the baby is a boy, the development of male sexual function will be affected, including movement of the testicles.; Estrogen affects the movement of the testicles to the scrotum: Pregnant women carrying male fetuses if they use a lot of diethylstilbestrol or anti-androgen drugs, the fetus is at high risk of disease.; Abnormalities in the development of the testicular-scrotal ligament: This condition causes the testicles to lie suspended in the path of movement, not reaching the scrotum.; Mechanical factors that hinder the movement of the testicles such as short testicular peduncles, fibrosis of the inguinal canal...\n\nSymptoms of undescended testicles\nUndescended testicles are divided into two types: palpable and non-palpable. About 80% of undescended testicles cannot be felt. (2)\nUsually, it can be detected when a patient's scrotal sac is observed to be asymmetrical. For example, one side is normal, while the other side is small or flat, if the case is hidden on one side. In case it is hidden on both sides, the scrotal sac will appear small and collapsed.\nSome common symptoms are:\nThere are no testicles in the scrotum or a raised tumor can be felt in the inguinal canal.; Underdeveloped scrotum: If the undescended testicle is higher, the scrotum will be less developed; Only one testicle is palpable. The condition is likely due to:; Testicular retraction: The testicles move up and down between the scrotum and groin, and when examined, they can easily descend back into the scrotum. This condition is not unusual, the cause may be scrotal reflexes.; Testicles move up or are acquired: Testicles return to the groin, unable to use hands to return to the scrotum.\nOften, undescended testicles and undescended testicles are terms that are easily confused with each other:\nUndescended testicles: Testicles are not located in the scrotum but are located along the path of the testicles such as in the abdomen, deep inguinal canal, inguinal canal and superficial inguinal canal.; Undescended testicles: Testicles located in another location (not on the path of the testicles from the abdomen to the scrotum) such as: perineum, femoral fascia...\n\nSubjects susceptible to disease\nSome of the factors below can increase the risk of undescended testicles, specifically:\nNewborn babies with very low birth weight (less than 0.9kg) are at very high risk of disease.; Undescended testicles occur in about 3% of full-term infants and about 30% of premature infants.; Family history of this disease or other reproductive system development problems; Having fetal diseases that prevent growth such as Down syndrome or abdominal wall defects; Pregnant women abuse alcohol, smoke or inhale cigarette smoke, are obese, have type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes... are risks that make the disease more likely to appear in newborns. .; Parents are often exposed to pesticides.\n\nDoes undescended testicles have any effect?\nThe normal temperature in the scrotum is lower than that of the body. When hidden in the abdomen, the testicles are exposed to high temperatures, making it very difficult to develop and reduce the number of germ cells in sperm. (3)\nIf a boy has a unilateral undescended testicle, located in the inguinal canal, he may have a normal sperm count. Meanwhile, boys have both undescended testicles in the inguinal canal, which can cause infertility. If patients do not have surgery after the age of 5, the infertility rate is up to 75%. If this condition is not detected and treated early, complications such as:\nTesticular torsion: Because it is not well fixed in the scrotum, the testicles  can become twisted. This is a common case. The patient has symptoms of sudden swelling and pain in the groin area on the undescended testicle. The skin in the scrotum becomes dark red or pale and loses wrinkles. Without emergency examination and surgery within 3 hours, the testicles are at very high risk of necrosis.; Malignant tumor: When an undescended testicle in the abdomen is discovered late, it can develop into a malignant tumor.; Testicular trauma: When not within the scrotal skin, the testicles can potentially be damaged by pressure from the pubic bone.; Inguinal hernia: When the testicles are located in the groin, it can create a gap between the abdomen and the inguinal canal. The larger this gap, the more likely it is to push part of the intestine into the groin. (4)\n\nDiagnostic method\nAbdominal ultrasound or laparoscopy: These are methods of exploration from low to high to determine the exact location of the undescended testicle. In addition, these methods also help doctors detect other abnormalities of the testicles such as calcification of testicular parenchyma, testicular tumors...; Chromosomal testing: This test depends on the case, to detect cases of unknown gender; Tumor marker tests: αFP, β-HCG, LDH should be performed to detect malignant tumors.\n\nCurrent treatment methods\nUndescended testicles need to be detected early and treated for children before 18 months of age. The only treatment is surgery to lower the testicles into the scrotum. The surgery will be conducted as follows:\nThe doctor observes and evaluates the abdominal organs to find and determine whether or not the patient has testicles, the location and size of the testicles, and evaluates whether the inguinal hole is closed or still open.; Proceed to remove the testicular sling as far away from the testicle as possible and release the testicle from the abdominal wall.; Release the spermatic vascular bundle and maximal vas deferens from the abdominal wall.; Creates a tunnel for the testicles to descend into the scrotum; Open the scrotal muscle to create a cavity, pulling the testicles out of the abdomen to move down into the scrotum.; Re-examine the abdomen and clean the abdomen to stop the bleeding.\nDepartment of Andrology, Tam Anh General Hospital System with a team of experts and doctors who are skilled, dedicated, enthusiastic, and confident in mastering the most advanced techniques with the support of machinery and equipment systems. Modern diagnostic imaging equipment such as: Somatom Drive 768-slice CT scanner, new generation magnetic resonance machine Magnetom Amira BioMatrix, ultrasound machine; Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss surgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table; Spacious facilities... will help detect early and have treatment plans for undescended testicles and male infertility safely and effectively.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of male infertility with leading experts at the Department of Andrology, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nUndescended testicles are a relatively dangerous disease for men, if not detected early and timely measures taken. Therefore, when noticing any testicular abnormalities in a child, family members need to quickly take the patient to a medical facility for proper diagnosis and treatment, to prevent dangerous complications. dangerous. If treated late, men's reproductive function may later be affected, leading to a very high risk of infertility.",
