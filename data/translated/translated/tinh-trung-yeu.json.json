    "content": "Weak sperm: Causes, signs and treatments\n\nSperm is the decisive factor in the success of conception. When sperm quality and quantity are reduced, the ability to conceive is reduced, negatively affecting reproductive health. So what should be done to improve weak sperm?\n\nWhat is weak sperm?\nWeak sperm is a condition in which the quality of sperm is reduced. The percentage of motile sperm is less than 75%, the percentage of dead and non-motile sperm is higher than 25%. Visible motility of sperm is less than 50%, rapid motility is less than 25%. Each time you ejaculate, the amount of semen is usually less than 2ml, and the number of sperm is less than 40 million. This case is called low coincidence.\nDecreased sperm quality is caused by many reasons, often directly related to men's diet and lifestyle habits. (first)\n\nSigns of weak sperm\nThe following signs can suggest to men the condition of weak sperm, specifically:\nSemen is thin and small in quantity: Semen does not have the typical stickiness or viscosity but is thin like rice water. This is a sign suggesting an abnormal decline in sperm quantity and quality, causing negative impacts on men's fertility.; Clumping semen: Symptoms are that the semen appears as small white particles like grains of rice, when squeezed, it feels smooth like powder. In this state, semen makes sperm easily die, making it difficult to move to fertilize the egg.; Solidified semen: At a temperature of 37Â°C, semen turns from a viscous state to liquefaction in less than 60 minutes. Failure to liquefy or only partial liquefaction is a sign of frozen semen. This makes it difficult for sperm to move to the egg, affecting conception results.; Abnormal semen color: If semen is yellow or green, men are likely to suffer from infectious diseases such as epididymitis, urethritis, prostatitis... If semen is brown (usually due to confusion). blood) accompanied by symptoms such as abdominal pain, penile pain, etc., these may be initial symptoms of diseases related to the urinary tract or genital organs.\n\nCauses of weak sperm\nThe process of sperm production is relatively complex, requiring the stable operation of all related parts such as the testicles, hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Any problems that occur during this process have the potential to affect sperm production and health. The causes that affect sperm quality are:\n1. Pathological causes\nVaricocele: This is the most common cause of male infertility. The cause of this condition is still unknown. Varicocele reduces sperm quality.; Infection: Some infections can affect sperm production or create scars that block sperm transport (mechanical obstruction). Infectious cases such as epididymitis, orchitis and sexually transmitted diseases (gonorrhea, HIV...); Autoimmune disease: This cause is rare. This is a condition in which antibodies attack and destroy the body's sperm.; Tumor: Tumors have the ability to cause hormonal imbalance, affecting male reproductive organs. In addition, tumor treatment can also affect men's fertility.; Hormonal imbalance: Hormones are an indispensable component in the sperm production process. Therefore, hormonal imbalance can harm sperm production.; Using some medications: Some medications have the potential to harm sperm production, causing men's fertility to decline.; Some other causes: Birth defects, genetic disorders... can potentially affect men's fertility.\n2. Environmental causes\nIndustrial chemicals: Prolonged exposure to benzene, xylene, toluene, pesticides, herbicides, organic solvents, paint materials... can have negative effects on sperm.; Heavy metals: Exposure to lead and other heavy metals is one of the causes of male infertility; Radiation: Exposure to radiation has the ability to reduce or completely lose the ability to produce sperm. It can take men up to several years to recover.\n3. Lifestyle and other causes\nAlcohol abuse: Alcohol and alcoholic beverages both have the ability to reduce testosterone levels, affecting sperm.; Smoking: Smoking harms many aspects of health, including reproductive health.; Stress, depression: Prolonged stress can have a negative impact on sperm quality; Weight: Being overweight or obese can both directly impact sperm and cause hormonal imbalance, affecting the spermatogenesis process.\n\nDiagnosis of weak sperm\nDuring a clinical examination, the doctor will examine the external genitalia and ask the patient to answer questions about previous diseases and sexual habits. In addition, to ensure accurate diagnosis results, the doctor will prescribe the patient to undergo a semen test. (2)\nThe doctor will take semen from the patient and analyze parameters such as sperm count and mobility. To limit errors and ensure the accuracy of semen test results, men should note:\nMake sure to take all the fluid for testing.; You should abstain from ejaculation for at least 2 days, but not more than 11 days before taking the test sample.; After taking the first test sample, the second test sample must be taken at least 2 weeks later.; Avoid using lubricants because they can affect sperm mobility\nDepending on the initial abnormality, the doctor will recommend the patient to conduct some additional tests to find the underlying cause of sperm weakness such as:\nTesticular ultrasound; Quantification of pituitary hormones and male hormones; Post-ejaculation urine test to detect retrograde ejaculation; Genetic analysis; Testicular biopsy; Prostate ultrasound\n\nMethods of treating weak sperm\nCurrently, there are many ways to treat weak sperm, it is important that doctors correctly determine the cause of this condition in patients.(3)\nIf the cause comes from an unhealthy lifestyle, men need to quickly change their lifestyle, minimizing factors that harm sperm quantity and quality. If the cause comes from a systemic disease or a disease related to reproductive health, the patient may be recommended to apply appropriate treatment methods such as:\nAntibiotics: Used to treat inflammatory diseases; Hormone therapy and endocrine drugs: When men have hormonal imbalance; Surgery: Applied when the cause is varicocele or vas deferens blockage.\n\nHow to prevent\nThere are no measures to help prevent weak sperm. However, some notes below can partly minimize this situation:\nMaintain a reasonable weight: Overweight and obese men often suffer from metabolic syndrome, which leads to decreased levels of male hormones (testosterone), while increasing levels of female hormones (estrogen). This imbalance causes men to have reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, and reduced sperm production; Healthy diet: Men should supplement foods such as green vegetables, fruits rich in antioxidants... to improve sperm health.\nPreventing sexually transmitted diseases: Sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, gonorrhea... can cause male infertility. To prevent this, men should limit the number of sexual partners and use condoms each time they have sex.; Avoid prolonged stress: Mental stress can reduce sexual performance, affecting the hormones needed for sperm production.; Exercise regularly: Physical activities with appropriate intensity will help increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes, supporting sperm protection.; Don't smoke: Smoking has a negative impact on overall health, including men's fertility.; Limit alcoholic beverages: Wine and alcoholic beverages will reduce testosterone levels, affecting sperm. If using alcohol or alcoholic beverages, men need to limit the amount they drink to a moderate amount.; Be careful with toxins: Exposure to pesticides, lead and other toxic substances can potentially affect sperm quantity and quality. When forced to work in environments with many toxic substances, men need to be careful such as wearing protective clothing and equipment, avoiding skin contact with chemicals.; Wear cool clothes: Increased scrotal temperature can harm sperm production. Although the benefits have not been fully proven, wearing loose and comfortable clothing, reducing sitting time, limiting saunas or hot baths, and avoiding contact with warm objects (phones, laptops, etc.) Can help increase sperm quality in men. (4)\nWith the mission of bringing happiness and trust to couples, the Andrology Department of Tam Anh General Hospital was born, providing high-class services in consulting, examining, diagnosing and treating diseases. Common and specialized diseases in the field of Andrology.\nThe department's team of experts regularly updates scientific research and modern protocols in consulting on men's health care with high effectiveness and safety.\nEstablished with the mission of \"Loving arms, bringing happiness and trust to each family\", the Department of Andrology at Tam Anh General Hospital has successfully treated many patients with health problems. reproductive health, bringing joy and happiness to thousands of couples.\nTo schedule an appointment for examination and treatment of male infertility with leading experts at the Department of Andrology, Tam Anh General Hospital system, please contact:\nWeak sperm is a male disease that needs attention because it directly affects family happiness and the potential risk of infertility in men.
