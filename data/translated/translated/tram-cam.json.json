Major depressive disorder affects about 163 million people (2% of the world's population) in 2017. This is a quite dangerous disorder, affecting mental, physical, life functions and happiness. in the patient's life.\n\nWhat is depression?\nDepression is one of the mental disorders. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one in 20 people will have had a depressive episode in the previous year. Every year an average of 850,000 people die from depression. Depressive disorders do not discriminate by gender or age, but the incidence of depression in women is twice that of men.\nPeople with depression may have gone through major life events such as bankruptcy, unemployment, debt, divorce... or there are also individuals with depressive disorders but not necessarily going through these events. major events, which can be changes in daily life: promotion, change of living environment, change of job, marriage... these events have a strong impact on a person's personal or spiritual life. them, challenge them for change.\nDepressive disorder not only affects the patient's mental health but also affects family and social relationships.\n\nWho is susceptible to depressive disorders?\nDepressive disorders can happen to everyone, but the most common age group is around 18-45 years old, in addition, middle-aged and old people are also susceptible to this disorder. This is a group that will face many demands from society, and changes in life (finding a job, getting married, having children as teenagers, retiring...). However, statistical medical research still has many subjects susceptible to depressive disorders, they belong to the following groups:\nGroup of people with psychological trauma: they experience major, sudden life events such as: bankruptcy, being scammed, losing all their money, going into debt, losing loved ones, broken marriages, spoiled children , work pressure is too great...; Group of women who have just given birth: This is a sensitive period, with many risks for women, rapid changes in hormones, family roles, lifestyle changes (lack of sleep...) or instability in earlier life also contributes to increasing the risk of depression in postpartum women.\nWomen are twice as likely to suffer from depression as men\nStudent groups: too much academic pressure, intense exams, pressure from parents and teachers, evaluation of academic results.; Group of people with physical injuries: people with accidents that require body parts to be amputated, traumatic brain injuries, cancer, and dangerous infectious diseases.; Group of subjects who abuse alcohol and stimulants for a long time; Group of people who lack resources in life: lack of supportive relationships, lack of communication, lack of ways to cope with stress, or other difficulties: economic, work.\n\nLevels of depression\nDepression is divided into 3 levels: mild - moderate - severe. To be diagnosed with depression or not, you must have at least one of two symptoms of core depression: Within two weeks, almost every day: You have low mood/or loss of interest plus at least 4 of the following symptoms:\nLose or gain weight, decrease or increase appetite.; Insomnia or constant sleep; Agitation or becoming sluggish; Fatigue or loss of strength; Feelings of worthlessness, worthlessness, or guilt; Reduced ability to concentrate, hesitation; Often think about death, have suicidal thoughts or behavior.\nSymptoms of depression in children and adolescents\nLow self-esteem; There are aggressive and agitated behaviors; Sleep disorders; There are physical discomforts and complaints; Loss of energy; Bored with school or learning failure; Or some children become too well-behaved, aloof, and indifferent\nBased on the above symptoms and the level, the neuropsychologist or psychologist will classify depression as mild, moderate, or severe.

Irritability, agitation or moodiness\nAnother sign of depression is increased irritability, agitation, and moodiness. Little things can annoy you – such as loud noises, or long waits (even if you haven't felt that way in a similar situation before). Sometimes anger is accompanied by thoughts of self-harm or a desire to harm others. If you are experiencing some of these feelings, seek help immediately.\n\nThe effects of depressive disorders\nDepression is considered a silent disease but can have extremely serious consequences.
