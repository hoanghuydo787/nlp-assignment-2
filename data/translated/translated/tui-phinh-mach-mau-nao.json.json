    "content": "What is a cerebral aneurysm? Common locations and treatments\n\nA cerebral aneurysm is a vascular disease in the brain. When not ruptured, a brain aneurysm may not affect the patient's health too much. However, you will not be able to tell when it breaks and if it breaks, it will be life-threatening.\n  In the world, about 2 - 8% of the population experiences a cerebral aneurysm. Usually, brain aneurysms have no obvious symptoms until the aneurysm is large enough or ruptures. A ruptured brain aneurysm will cause a hemorrhagic stroke, affecting the patient's life. Surveying and evaluating the aneurysm as well as the location of the cerebral aneurysm will contribute to increasing the effectiveness of treatment.\n So what is the cause, diagnosis and treatment of brain aneurysm? Please refer to the following basic information about this disease.\n\nWhat is a cerebral aneurysm?\nA cerebral aneurysm is a condition in which one or more blood vessels in the brain bulge, forming a \"sac\". The shape of the aneurysm resembles a berry. Experts believe that brain aneurysms form when blood flows through and puts pressure on a weak area of ​​the vessel wall, over time causing the vessel wall to dilate and form an enlarged aneurysm.\nBrain aneurysms can form anywhere in the patient's brain, most commonly in the major arteries along the base of the skull. Most small aneurysms will not cause any unusual symptoms, but when the aneurysm is large enough, it will cause related symptoms and put pressure on nearby nerves or brain tissue.\nThe aneurysm needs to be removed (if necessary) and when it accidentally ruptures, the patient needs to get medical attention as soon as possible because it can be life-threatening. Typically, a ruptured aneurysm occurs in the space between the brain and the thin tissues that cover the brain; causes bleeding inside the brain and is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Anyone can get a brain aneurysm, especially patients between the ages of 30 and 60.\nBrain aneurysms can form anywhere in the patient's brain\n\nCommon locations of cerebral aneurysms\nIn fact, any arterial area in the brain can form a brain aneurysm. Normally, more than 1 cerebral aneurysm can form in the brain. Among them, cerebral aneurysm or aortic aneurysm is the most common type of cerebral aneurysm, accounting for about 90% of all cases. Cerebral aneurysms often occur in arteries located in front of the brain, especially in the branching area of ​​the cerebral blood vessels at the base of the brain. (first)\nIn addition, dissecting aneurysms and fusiform aneurysms are also two common types of brain aneurysms. Specifically:\nFusiform aneurysms are considered to be the result of damage from severe atherosclerotic plaques in the brain; The location that usually appears is in the basilar circuit.; A dissecting aneurysm is a collection of blood inside the vessel wall and is often related to high blood pressure or brain injury.\n\nCause of cerebral aneurysm\nThe cause of the formation of aneurysms in brain vessels may be due to blood dynamics causing pressure on blood vessel branches in the branching area in the brain. Some problems such as infection, trauma, radiation exposure, tumors, etc. inside the brain are also considered causes of brain aneurysm formation.\nIn addition, the cause of brain aneurysms can also come from risk factors that affect the health of brain arteries, including: (2)\nGenetic factors cause the cerebral arteries to be too thin and the cerebral blood vessels to branch weaker than other cerebral blood vessels such as: Ehlers-Danlos vascular syndrome, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, Marfan syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis. fibromuscular dysplasia, arteriovenous malformations, first-degree relatives (parents, siblings) with a history of cerebral aneurysm,...; In addition, other factors such as: Regular smoking, prolonged alcoholism, use of other drugs (especially cocaine), etc. lead to hypertension, weakening the cerebral artery walls; This can cause a cerebral aneurysm.\n\nSymptoms of cerebral aneurysm\nSymptoms of a brain aneurysm depend on whether the aneurysm has ruptured or not.\nSymptoms of unruptured cerebral aneurysm\nMost unruptured brain aneurysms will not cause symptoms. However, when a brain aneurysm grows large enough, it will put pressure on nearby nerves or brain tissue, causing symptoms such as: (3)\nHeadache.; Vision changes.; Pupils widen (dilated).; Numbness or tingling in the head or face; Pain above and behind the eyes; Convulsion.\nWhen a brain aneurysm grows large enough, it will cause symptoms: headaches, convulsions, dilated pupils, etc.\nSymptoms of a cerebral aneurysm when it ruptures\nBefore rupture, aneurysms in the brain will leak some blood, called a focal hemorrhage. At this time, the patient may have a warning headache due to a small aneurysm leak for several days or weeks before the aneurysm actually ruptures. A ruptured aneurysm in the brain will cause many dangerous symptoms such as: (4)\nSevere headache (sudden onset, strong pain intensity can cause the patient to faint or coma).; Nausea and vomiting; Neck tense.; Blurry or double vision; Sensitivity to light (photophobia).; Convulsion.; The eyelids droop and the pupils dilate.; Pain above and behind the eyes; Cognitive disorders.; Weakness or paralysis of the whole body; Gradual loss of consciousness; Causes cerebral hemorrhagic stroke.\n\nAre cerebral aneurysms dangerous?\nA brain aneurysm has the potential to endanger the patient's health, especially when it ruptures, causing bleeding and pressure on surrounding brain tissue. A ruptured brain aneurysm can cause life-threatening problems such as:\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH): Bleeding in the area between the brain and the arachnoid layer in the brain. The possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to ruptured cerebral aneurysm is as high as 90%.; Hemorrhagic stroke: Bleeding in the space between the skull and brain.\nIf not treated promptly, subarachnoid hemorrhage and hemorrhagic stroke can lead to permanent brain damage or a number of dangerous complications such as:\nVasospasm: Occurs when blood vessels narrow, hindering the transport of oxygen to the brain.; Hydrocephalus: Occurs when there is a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid or blood buildup around the brain.; Convulsions: This is a sign that the brain cannot control its activities. Convulsions will cause brain damage to become more serious.; Coma: Is a state of unconsciousness lasting from a few days to a few weeks.; Death: Up to 50% of brain aneurysms lead to death.\n\nWhat causes a brain aneurysm to rupture?\nA number of pathological factors and lifestyle habits promote the development of brain aneurysms, causing the aneurysm to increase in size and rupture.\nHigh blood pressure is a common cause of ruptured brain aneurysms. High blood pressure will cause blood to push against the blood vessel walls. Effects that can cause blood pressure in the body to increase, leading to the rupture of a brain aneurysm include:\nOften stressed and angry; High-intensity labor, sudden vigorous exercise; Hypertension is not treated promptly and properly.\nThe doctor will examine and rely on the following factors to determine the possibility of a brain aneurysm rupture:\nSize and shape: If the brain aneurysm has an irregular shape and large size, the risk of rupture increases; Growth rate: Through test results, the doctor will determine whether the brain aneurysm is growing or not, and whether the growth rate is fast or slow.; Location: Aneurysms in the posterior communicating arteries (a pair of arteries in the back of the brain) and anterior communicating arteries (an artery in the front of the brain) have a higher risk of rupture than aneurysms in other cerebral arteries. other position.; Race: Statistics show that the risk of aneurysm rupture may be higher in certain races.; Age: Patients over 70 years old have a higher risk of aneurysm rupture.\n\nHow to detect a brain aneurysm?\nMost unruptured brain aneurysms will have no symptoms and will only be detected by doctors using imaging techniques such as CT scans and MRI scans of the brain. Patients can go for regular screening, especially in cases of persistent headaches, decreased vision, etc. Imaging tests that can help diagnose and evaluate cerebral aneurysms include:\nCT scan (computed tomography): CT scan helps doctors examine the condition of blood leakage in the brain. This technique uses X-rays to create cross-sectional or detailed images of blood flow in the brain's arteries. This imaging technique will show the size, location and shape of the brain aneurysm.; MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): This technique uses radio waves to create detailed images of the brain arteries and can show the size, location and shape of the aneurysm.; Cerebral angiography with DSA machine: This is an endovascular intervention technique with the purpose of collecting images of cerebral arteries. This technique will help doctors detect blockages and identify weaknesses in the cerebral artery walls, including brain aneurysms.; Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis: The doctor will collect a cerebrospinal fluid sample using a lumbar puncture, prescribed by the doctor for the purpose of measuring the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord. A cerebrospinal fluid analysis procedure will help doctors detect bleeding problems around the brain.\nCheck to see if there is an aneurysm in the brain vessel with some diagnostic imaging tests: CT scan, MRI scan, cerebral angiogram, cerebrospinal fluid analysis\n\nHow to treat a brain aneurysm\nThe main goal of treating a brain aneurysm is to stop or reduce blood flow to the brain aneurysm, or to intervene and remove it using various techniques. Depending on the condition, an unruptured cerebral aneurysm can be monitored by a doctor or treated immediately.\nIn case treatment is needed, the doctor will recommend appropriate treatment options based on the size and location of the aneurysm and a number of other factors such as health status and medical history of the person. sick. Accordingly, there are currently solutions for treating brain aneurysms including:\nMicrovascular cutting surgery at the aneurysm sac\nThe neurosurgeon will cut a small hole in the skull to access and attach a metal clip to the base of the aneurysm to stop the bleeding. Microangiectomy will help stop bleeding or keep the brain aneurysm from rupturing.\nNormally, the recovery time after microangiectomy to treat a brain aneurysm is as follows:\nFor unruptured brain aneurysms, recovery takes 2 to 4 weeks; For a ruptured brain aneurysm, it takes several weeks to several months to recover.\nOnce treated with this method, the aneurysm has very little chance of recurring.\nEndovascular intervention to plug a cerebral aneurysm\nFor this treatment, the interventional surgeon places a catheter (flexible tube) into a blood vessel in the thigh or wrist and threads it into the brain, reaching the site of the aneurysm. Through the catheter, the doctor will inject the material and block the blood vessels to the aneurysm.\nPlacement of flow diversion stents to treat brain aneurysms\nThis technique helps redirect blood flow away instead of into the brain aneurysm. This is an endovascular intervention method with optimal treatment effectiveness for unruptured cerebral aneurysms.\nAdditional treatments\nIf a brain aneurysm ruptures, doctors will consider using additional treatments to control symptoms and prevent complications. Additional treatments include:\nAnticonvulsants: These medications can help prevent seizures related to a ruptured aneurysm.; Calcium channel blockers: These medications may help reduce the risk of stroke caused by vasospasm.; Shunt: Using a tube to drain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the brain to another place in the body helps prevent hydrocephalus.\nNormally, patients with ruptured aneurysms need physical therapy to restore body functions to prevent complications of total paralysis.\n\nWhat to do when there is an aneurysm in the brain?\nDoctors need to determine the condition and prognosis of the brain aneurysm to provide appropriate treatment. If the brain aneurysm is small, has not ruptured, is in a non-dangerous location, does not cause symptoms, and the patient has no other associated risk factors, treatment is not required. Instead, patients need to have regular check-ups to monitor the condition of the brain aneurysm.\nIf the brain aneurysm is in a dangerous location or has grown to a larger size and is causing symptoms, the patient needs to consult a doctor for appropriate treatment. Treatment options for brain aneurysms depend on the following factors:\nAge and general health of the patient; Location and size of aneurysm.; Family medical history.\nMaintaining a healthy body and stable blood pressure will help limit brain aneurysm rupture\nHigh blood pressure is a favorable condition that promotes the rapid development of brain aneurysms, making them more susceptible to rupture. Therefore, patients need to maintain stable blood pressure by adjusting living habits, avoiding factors that cause high blood pressure, thereby limiting the rupture of brain aneurysms.\n\nHow to prevent brain aneurysms?\nYou cannot prevent risk factors for aneurysm formation such as age, genetics, etc. but you can reduce the risk of disease onset by:\nMaintain healthy blood pressure by eating scientifically, exercising moderately, getting enough sleep, etc. or taking medication to treat hypertension as prescribed by your doctor.; Stay away from cigarettes, alcohol, stimulants, and limit prolonged stress; General health check-ups every 6 months contribute to early detection of brain aneurysms, timely intervention and treatment when necessary, and building a suitable lifestyle to limit the risk of aneurysms bursting.\nTo schedule an examination for brain aneurysms and neurological problems, you can contact the Department of Neurosurgery, Neurology Center at Tam Anh General Hospital System via:\nIn short, cerebral aneurysms have a silent development process. If a brain aneurysm ruptures, it will lead to many dangerous complications such as brain hemorrhage, stroke,... with a high risk of death. If you suspect that you have signs of a brain aneurysm or other neurological diseases, you need to go to the hospital as soon as possible to be directly examined and treated promptly by a doctor.",

Microangiectomy will help stop bleeding or keep the brain aneurysm from rupturing.\nNormally, the recovery time after microangiectomy to treat a brain aneurysm is as follows:\nFor unruptured brain aneurysms, recovery takes 2 to 4 weeks; For a ruptured brain aneurysm, it takes several weeks to several months to recover.\nOnce treated with this method, the aneurysm has very little chance of recurring.\nEndovascular intervention to plug a cerebral aneurysm\nFor this treatment, the interventional surgeon places a catheter (flexible tube) into a blood vessel in the thigh or wrist and threads it into the brain, reaching the site of the aneurysm. Through the catheter, the doctor will inject the material and block the blood vessels to the aneurysm.\nPlacement of flow diversion stents to treat brain aneurysms\nThis technique helps redirect blood flow away instead of into the brain aneurysm. This is an endovascular intervention method with optimal treatment effectiveness for unruptured cerebral aneurysms.\nAdditional treatments\nIf a brain aneurysm ruptures, doctors will consider using additional treatments to control symptoms and prevent complications. Additional treatments include:\nAnticonvulsants: These medications can help prevent seizures related to a ruptured aneurysm.; Calcium channel blockers: These medications may help reduce the risk of stroke caused by vasospasm.; Shunt: Using a tube to drain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the brain to another place in the body helps prevent hydrocephalus.\nNormally, patients with ruptured aneurysms need physical therapy to restore body functions to prevent complications of total paralysis."
