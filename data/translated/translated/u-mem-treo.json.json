Although it does not seriously affect health, it causes loss of aesthetics and reduces confidence if it appears in visible locations such as the face, neck, etc.\n\nWhat is hanging molluscum?\nMolluscum contagiosum, also known as skin tag or skin tag, is a benign growth of normal skin. The soft tumor has a smooth surface, often grows from a stalk or papilla, protrudes completely above the skin surface, and is black, yellow, brown or similar to the skin color. These soft lumps often form in areas where the skin is exposed to sunlight such as the face, neck, etc.; or areas of skin that rub together a lot such as the neck, armpits, under the breasts, eyelids, groin, and anus. (first)\nThese skin tags are usually 1-10mm in size, but in many cases the size is up to 3cm, or even larger. A person can have many hanging mollusks at the same time, possibly 3 - 4 or more than 10 skin tags. The disease often appears in people over 50 years old.\nAfter the examination, the doctor prescribed Mrs. H. to treat excess skin with liquid nitrogen and surgery without \"going under the knife\". After 2 weeks of follow-up examination, the soft lumps in the eyes and nose disappeared. Mrs. H. no longer feels itchy or uncomfortable, especially her steps are steadier because her vision is no longer limited.\n\nCauses of hanging molluscum\nAccording to Dr. Bich, molluscum contagiosum occurs with two factors: subjective and objective: (2)\nSubjective factors are due to skin being exposed to the sun for too long, for long periods of time without appropriate sun protection measures. In women, the parts of the skin that are exposed to the sun a lot are the neck, chest, etc.; For men, the back, shoulders and many other areas due to the habit of going bare in the sun will have a higher risk of skin tags appearing. People who sunbathe, go to the beach, work outdoors too much such as fishing, street vendors... who do not use sun protection accessories are at high risk.\nThe objective factor comes from our country's tropical monsoon climate and bright sunlight for many hours a day. This is the main cause of skin aging in the elderly. Statistics show that about 80%-90% of Vietnamese people suffer from skin damage caused by sunlight. In addition, advanced age is also a factor causing skin aging. If young people suffer from this condition, it is called premature skin aging. The process of forming soft tumors takes about 3-4 years.\n\nSigns of molluscum contagiosum\nAlthough the disease is benign, it greatly affects aesthetics, especially when the patient is young. Accordingly, the symptoms of hanging molluscum contagiosum are:\nThe nodules are round, firm, smooth and raised on the skin; Nodules can be concentrated in groups, localized or spread on the skin/mucosal surface.; In young children, hanging mollusks often appear on the face, chest, neck, arms, and legs; For adults, excess skin is found in areas exposed to the sun a lot such as the face, neck, hands... or genital area.\nIn addition, depending on the location where the tumor appears, it will cause consequences in that part. Specifically, excess skin tags that appear on the eyelids cause drooping eyelids; In the penis, it affects physiological needs; In the anus, it causes pain and affects the need to defecate...\nExcessive sun exposure is the cause of the disease\n\nDoes hanging molluscum contagiosum cause complications?\nSuspended molluscum contagiosum will cause complications if the patient ignores it and treats it with folk remedies such as burning, cutting with sutures... which will cause infection, bleeding, and bad scarring.\nIt is estimated that 50 – 60% of adults will develop at least one skin nodule in their lifetime. The frequency of these nodules increases after age 40. They occur more commonly in people with obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and in people with a family history of skin diseases. The disease affects men and women equally. (3)\nIn many cases, obese people are at higher risk of complications:\nScars appear after molluscum surgery.; Causes torsion or spontaneous infarction in pedunculated skin tags, causing tissue ischemia, pain, and even necrosis/secondary infection. At this time it is necessary to seek support from a clinician.; Mild irritation, even irritant dermatitis, occurs in the surgical area; Rarely, a neuroma can occur if a nerve grows in the excised fleshy mass, causing chronic pain for several weeks or even months.\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nPatients should immediately see a dermatologist for timely treatment when they see the following symptoms:\nAppearance of unusual tumors in different locations on the body and suspicion of those nodules being suspension molluscum; Feeling of irritation, itching or pain at the tumor site; affecting communication and aesthetic factors...\n\nMethods of diagnosis and treatment of hanging molluscum\nAccording to Dr. Bich, treatment of hanging molluscum is a simple cosmetic procedure. There are many cosmetic treatment methods, especially using cold nitrogen to burn by dabbing, shooting or clamping nitrogen into the lesion. The advantage of this method is that it does not require anesthesia or anesthesia, does not cause pain, does not bleed and leaves no scars. After proper medical treatment, molluscum contagiosum does not reappear in the treated location. (4)\nIn addition, surgical excision, electrocautery of lesions, laser burning... are also methods chosen to treat this disease.\n\nPrecautions\nPrevent molluscum contagiosum by wearing a hat, sunshade, glasses, sunscreen... when going out, especially when going to the beach in the summer. In addition, supplement vitamin E to slow down the skin aging process and prevent dermatological problems from arising. In particular, patients should see a doctor when molluscum contagiosum appears in important locations such as the eyes, face, sensitive areas, or when the lesion is larger than 2cm in size.\nDr. Dang Thi Ngoc Bich is the person who laid the first brick, building and promoting the work of both skin medical examination and treatment and skin aesthetics at the Tam Anh General Hospital system in Ho Chi Minh City. In particular, Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City has the advantage of modern machinery and equipment, a team of highly skilled doctors and technicians, and a convenient location for people to examine skin diseases and skin aesthetics. safe and effective.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with a Dermatologist at Tam Anh General Hospital System, you can choose from the following options:\nContact hotline 0287 102 6789 (HCMC) or 024 3872 3872 - 024 7106 6858 (Hanoi) to register for a private examination with a specialist.; Register for an appointment at the link: https://tamanhhospital.vn/danh-cho-khach-hang/dat-lich-kham/; Send a message on Tam Anh General Hospital Fanpage.; Text message via Zalo OA of Tam Anh General Hospital.\nAccording to Dr. Bich, like other dermatological diseases, although molluscum contagiosum is not immediately life-threatening, it greatly affects health and causes inconvenience in daily life and work. Sometimes patients do not know who to share with, especially skin diseases in private areas. Therefore, patients need to monitor abnormal manifestations on the skin and get examined early to have timely treatment measures to prevent complications.",
