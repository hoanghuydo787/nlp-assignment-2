So, you really know\nWhat is a brain tumor?\nNot yet?\n\nWhat is a brain tumor?\nA brain tumor is a collection of large numbers of brain cells that grow abnormally beyond the body's control. Brain tumors can start directly from brain cells, glial cells of the central nervous system, or can also start from other parts (for example, lungs, kidneys...) and then follow the blood to the brain. called brain metastases. (first)\nMechanism of formation: Normally, from birth to death, no more nerve cells are born. When there are unexplained mutations in DNA that cause cells to divide uncontrollably, a brain tumor will form.; Effects: The growth rate and location of the brain tumor determine its severity and impact on nervous system function, even life-threatening if not diagnosed, monitored and treated. timely treatment.; Prevalence: Brain tumors account for 2% of all cancer cases from all age groups. Among cancer deaths in children under 15 years old and in the 20-39 age group, brain tumors are the second highest cause of death. People over 85 years old have the highest rate of brain tumors. .\nThe rate of brain tumors in older people is often higher.\n\nClassification of brain tumors\nThe brain is made up of countless different tissues and cells, so it can develop into many types of tumors. There are more than 130 different types of brain tumors with typical brain tumor signs. In particular, diseases are divided into groups including:\nDivided by origin: Brain tumors include 02 types: primary brain tumors and secondary brain tumors.; Divided by nature: Brain tumors include 02 types: benign brain tumors and malignant brain tumors.; Divided by level: Brain tumors include 04 types: brain tumors level 1, level 2, level 3, level 4.\nPrimary brain tumors and secondary brain tumors\nPrimary brain tumor\nPrimary brain tumors are brain tumors that form and develop on their own from cells of the brain and central nervous system (not due to transmission from other areas of the body). The cause of a primary brain tumor can also occur in the spinal cord, meninges (area covering the brain) or nerves leading from the brain.\nCharacteristics: 70% of primary brain tumors are benign (non-cancerous) brain tumors but 30% are malignant (cancerous) tumors. Primary brain tumors can be easily removed and completely cured if they are benign tumors.; Prevalence: The rate of cancer from primary brain tumors accounts for only 2% of the total number of cancer cases from other parts of the body.; Subject: The older people are, the more likely they are to develop primary brain tumors. Almost 25% of patients diagnosed with primary brain tumors in the UK are aged 75 or over. In addition, primary brain tumors are the second most common cancer (after acute lymphoblastic leukemia) in children under 15 years old.\nSecondary brain tumor\nSecondary brain tumors are tumors that appear in the brain because cancer cells from another organ (such as the lungs) have spread to the brain. Any type of cancer in the body, if not detected promptly, can metastasize, leading to secondary brain cancer.\nCharacteristics: Secondary brain tumors are always malignant tumors. In about 50% of cases, the cause of secondary brain tumors is metastasis from lung cancer, followed by metastasis from breast cancer, kidney, skin, colon, melanoma,...; Popularity: Secondary brain tumor cases account for 50-80% of the total number of brain tumor cases today, which is nearly four times the number of primary brain tumor cases.; Subjects: According to statistics, secondary brain tumors are common in the elderly group (aged 70 and older) and have a high risk of appearing in any subject who has or has a history of cancer.\nBenign brain tumors and malignant brain tumors\nBenign (non-cancerous) brain tumors\nDefinition: A benign brain tumor is a type of brain tumor that grows slowly, does not metastasize, and can be completely treated by surgically removing the tumor directly without the need for radiotherapy or chemotherapy.; Characteristics: Although benign tumors can be cured, they can still be life-threatening if not promptly removed through surgery. The disease is less likely to recur after surgery if it is completely removed. Therefore, you need to proactively have regular health checks to screen and early detect benign tumors (if any).\nMalignant brain tumor (cancer)\nDefinition: A malignant brain tumor is a type of brain tumor that contains cancer cells (cells that divide rapidly beyond control). This tumor easily attacks and metastasizes to neighboring healthy cells. The disease develops quickly, relapses easily and directly affects the patient's life.; Characteristics: When a patient has a malignant tumor, the treatment method is often a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. Malignant brain tumors account for nearly 30% of all primary brain tumors, while secondary brain tumors (due to metastasis) are 100% malignant.\nClassify tumors by grade\nThis classification divides brain tumors into 4 levels (also known as 4 stages) from stage 1 to stage 4.\nTo determine the grade (stage) of the tumor, the doctor will base it on the shape characteristics of the tumor cells observed under a microscope. The more normal the tumor cell sample looks (similar to healthy cells), the lower the brain tumor grade.\nBiological characteristics and treatment methods for brain tumors at each level also have big differences:\nBrain tumor grade / stage  Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Stage 4  Tumor cell identity  Looks a lot like healthy brain cells  Looks less like healthy brain cells Cells look more abnormal . The cells look very abnormal. Likelihood of growing, spreading  Slow, unlikely to spread Slow, possibly spreading Fast, easily spreading into other parts of the brain and spinal cord Fast, very contagious  Possibility of recurrence Less Likely High Very high  Treatment Surgery Surgery is the main thing, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy (if needed) You are more likely to need radiotherapy and chemotherapy after surgery. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy\nSome common types of brain tumors\nCurrently, there are 4 common types of brain tumors: (2)\nGliomas: Also called gliomas because they are brain tumors that start in glial cells in the brain or spinal cord. Gliomas are a type of malignant primary brain tumor, accounting for about 50.4% of all brain tumor cases and 78% of malignant primary brain tumor cases.; Meningioma: A slow-growing tumor that forms from the meninges or membrane surrounding the spinal cord. Meningiomas are benign tumors that often appear in women, accounting for about 20.8% of all brain tumor cases with a low recurrence rate after surgery (less than 20%).; Pituitary adenoma: A tumor that occurs in the pituitary gland (located on the surface below the brain) with more than 60% of cases diagnosed as benign, 35% as invasive tumors. According to statistics, pituitary tumors account for 10% - 25% of all brain tumors and the incidence can be up to 17% of the population.; Peripheral nerve tumors: Caused by fibroblasts that grow around nerve bundles and account for about 10% of all brain tumors. Most peripheral nerve tumors are benign (not cancerous). However, the tumor compresses the nerves causing pain and can cause loss of muscle control.\nThe earlier a brain tumor is detected, the higher the prognosis for cure. So what are the early signs of brain tumor?\n\nBrain tumor symptoms\nSymptoms of brain tumors are diverse and different for each patient. In general, brain tumor signs are divided into 2 groups:\nGroup of brain tumor signs related to increased intracranial pressure causing nerve compression.; The group of brain tumor signs is caused by the location where the tumor appears.\nSigns of brain tumor due to intracranial pressure\nYour skull is the hard, thick layer of bone that surrounds the cerebral cortex. Therefore, any brain tumor growth inside such a narrow, closed and confined space can create a huge amount of intracranial pressure that compresses the nervous system.\nIn the group of brain tumor symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure, patients often feel: (3)\nHeadache: Headaches occur frequently with high frequency, especially when waking up in the morning or when coughing, sneezing, or exercising.; Epilepsy (convulsions): Up to 8 out of 10 people with brain tumors have seizures. You may experience convulsions in your hands, arms, legs, and may spread to your entire body.; Eyes and vision: Drooping eyelids, uneven pupils, blurred vision, dizziness, decreased vision.; Memory loss: Forgetfulness, absent-mindedness, temporary memory loss.; Reduced alertness: May include dizziness, drowsiness, difficulty sleeping, insomnia, unconsciousness, loss of consciousness.; Psychological instability: Changes in mood, personality, emotions and behavior, depression, feeling of loss of interest in even previous pleasures.; Other problems: Fever, low blood pressure, fatigue, chills, temperature sensitivity.\nHeadache is the most common symptom of a brain tumor\nSigns of brain tumor due to tumor location\nDepending on the tumor location, brain tumor symptoms are also very diverse and can affect different body parts. Specifically:\nSigns of a frontal lobe brain tumor: The frontal lobe controls movements like walking and is part of your personality. A tumor in the frontal lobe can cause: Arms and legs: Numbness in the arms, legs, tremors in the hands, tremors in the legs, uncontrolled hand movements, difficulty walking. Ears - Nose - Throat: Impaired ability to hear, taste or smell. It is easy to feel nauseous or vomit continuously. Change in voice, loss of appetite, loss of smell, weight loss. Body: Numbness or tingling on one side of the body,  weakness of one arm or leg, or twitching (especially in adults). Behavioral instability: Personality changes, behaving in ways you don't usually do; Hands and feet: Numbness in hands, feet, shaking hands, shaking legs, uncontrollable hand movements, difficulty walking.; Ears - Nose - Throat: Impaired ability to hear, taste or smell. It is easy to feel nauseous or vomit continuously. Change in voice, loss of appetite, loss of smell, weight loss; Body: Numbness or tingling on one side of the body,  weakness of one arm or leg, or convulsions (especially in adults).; Behavioral instability: Personality changes, behaving in ways you don't usually do; Temporal lobe brain tumor symptoms: The temporal lobe is where you process sound and where you store memories. A tumor in this area can cause: Short-term memory loss. Difficulty hearing and speaking; Short-term memory loss.; Difficulty hearing and speaking; Signs of parietal brain tumor: The parietal lobe allows you to recognize objects and store that knowledge. A tumor in this area can cause: Difficulty writing, difficulty reading, difficulty swallowing, difficulty understanding what others are saying. Loss of feeling in part of the body; Difficulty writing, reading, swallowing, understanding what others are saying; Loss of feeling in part of the body; Occipital lobe brain tumor symptoms: The occipital lobe processes what you can see. A tumor located in this area can cause vision problems such as darkened vision, dizziness, and blurred images. Difficulty determining the color and size of the object.; Vision is dark, dizziness, images are blurred; Difficulty determining the color and size of the object.; Signs of a brain tumor in the cerebellum: The cerebellum controls our balance and posture. So, a tumor in this area can cause: Problems with coordination, walking and balance. Uncontrolled eye movements such as eyelid twitching; Problems with walking coordination and balance; Uncontrolled eye movements such as eyelid twitching; Brain stem tumor symptoms: The brain stem controls important body functions such as breathing. A tumor in this area can cause: Difficulty swallowing and speaking. Staggering and difficulty walking; Difficulty swallowing and speaking; Staggering and difficulty walking; Symptoms of a pituitary brain tumor: The pituitary gland makes important hormones for your body to function. A tumor in this area of ​​the brain can cause: Weight gain, high blood sugar (diabetes). Infertility, milk leakage from the breasts even if you are not breastfeeding. Mood changes, increased blood pressure; Weight gain, high blood sugar (diabetes).; Infertility, milk leakage from the breasts even if you are not breastfeeding.; Mood changes, increased blood pressure; Pineal brain tumor symptoms: The pineal gland produces a hormone called melatonin that is in charge of controlling sleep. Tumors in this area can cause: Insomnia, fatigue, headaches. Loss of balance when walking; Insomnia, fatigue, headache; Loss of balance when walking; Signs of spinal cord tumors: The spinal cord is a long bundle of nerves that stretches from the brain to the lower part of the back. A tumor in the spinal cord can cause pain and numbness or weakness in different parts of the body. You may also lose control of your bladder or bowels, affecting excretion and digestion.\nBrain tumors in different brain regions will give different symptoms\n\nCauses of brain tumors\nThe exact cause of brain tumors in most cases is impossible to determine. However, there are many potential causes. Anything that increases your chance of getting a brain tumor can be considered a risk factor for the disease (i.e., an underlying cause).\nJust because you have one of the brain tumor risk factors below does not guarantee that you will get a brain tumor in the future. Risk factors that increase the risk of brain tumors may be: (4)\nAge\nThe older a person is, the more likely they are to get a brain tumor. Most brain tumors occur in adults between the ages of 85 and 89, although some types of brain tumors are more common in children under 15 years of age.\nFamily history (genetics)\nAccording to reports, only 5-10% of all cancer cases are hereditary. Brain tumors account for only 2% of all cancers worldwide, so the rate of inherited brain tumors is very low.; Some genetic conditions are known to increase the risk of brain tumors, including: tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis type 1, type 2, Turner syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Turcot syndrome , Gorlin syndrome,…\nUnscientific diet\nSome studies have shown that dietary N-nitroso compounds may influence the risk of brain tumors in children and adults.; Recently, Dr. Lee Wrensch discovered that people with glioma had a high incidence of consuming diets low in fruits, vegetables, and vitamin C that were high in nitrites such as cheese, fish, bacon, and processed foods. processed, fermented, salted overnight (dried fish), canned.\nOverweight and obesity\nBeing overweight or obese increases the risk of meningioma. Around 2% of all brain tumor diagnoses in the UK each year are due to being overweight or obese.; Trying to maintain a healthy weight by participating in physical activity and eating moderately is essential.\nThere was no history of chickenpox\nAccording to a 2016 report published in the journal Cancer Medicine, people who had no history of chickenpox in childhood were 21% more likely to develop glioma than people who had chickenpox. .\nChemical exposure\nSome occupations, due to their specific working environment, require exposure to many chemicals that can increase the risk of brain cancer, such as:\nAgricultural workers have to be exposed to a lot of pesticides; Workers working in environments high in heavy metals (nickel, mercury).; People working in the construction materials industry, roofing sheets, tiles, boat building, etc. due to heavy exposure to asbestos can cause brain tumors.; People living near industrial wastewater sources and collective landfills containing Vinyl Chloride.; Petroleum workers who do not properly protect themselves inhale aromatic compounds such as benzene and ethylbenzene for long periods of time.\nEating unscientifically or living near sources of pollution also increases the risk of brain tumors\nExposure to radiation\nIonizing radiation is a type of radiation used by some medical scanning procedures, such as X-rays and CT scans. People who have been exposed to ionizing radiation have a higher risk of brain tumors than the general population. (5); Therefore, if you have had a history of previous radiation therapy for other cancers, it may also slightly increase your risk of brain tumors. However, brain tumors caused by radiation exposure occur very rarely (less than 1%).\n\nIs brain tumor dangerous?\nBrain tumors are very dangerous whether they are benign brain tumors or malignant brain tumors. The disease, whether treated promptly or not, can easily leave certain complications, seriously affecting daily life, shortening the patient's lifespan or even threatening life.\nThese complications vary in severity depending on the condition, including:\nHeadache - dizziness - vertigo: Is the most common complication after brain tumor treatment. This side effect comes from the fact that the surgical wound has not yet healed and the anesthetic has not yet worn off.; Fatigue - drowsiness: The effects of sedatives used during brain tumor surgery can give you a feeling of drowsiness and weak limbs after treatment.; Sore throat: During brain tumor surgery, the patient will have a breathing tube (through the throat) placed to regulate breathing and the amount of oxygen reaching the brain. Therefore, when surgery is over, a sore throat is not a rare complication.; Communication impairment: Some patients after brain tumor treatment are slow to speak, slow to read, slow to write, slow to understand, have poor communication reflexes, slurred speech, etc., affecting their ability to communicate daily; Sensory and motor impairment: Eyes may be blurred, ears may be slightly deaf, taste loss, nose taste loss, limbs numb, partially paralyzed, weak, trembling or difficult to control, maintaining balance are different complications that occur depending on the body.; Reduced life expectancy or death:\nWith benign brain tumors: The 5-year survival rate for meningiomas, the most common type of benign primary brain tumor, is over 96% for children 14 years of age and younger, 97% for those aged 14 years and younger. 15 to 39 years old and over 87% in adults 40 years and older. With malignant brain tumors: The average five-year survival rate for all malignant brain tumor patients in the United States and England is 33% and 10%, respectively; With benign brain tumors: The 5-year survival rate for meningiomas, the most common type of benign primary brain tumor, is over 96% for children 14 years of age and younger, 97% for those aged 14 years and younger. 15 to 39 years old and over 87% in adults 40 years and older.; With malignant brain tumors: The average five-year survival rate for all malignant brain tumor patients in the US and UK is 33% and 10%, respectively.\nBrain tumor complications can gradually improve over time naturally or thanks to physical therapy exercises, or they can also not improve and get worse, all depending on each person's constitution.\nTherefore, the sooner you detect brain tumor signs or brain tumor symptoms through regular health checks, the more you can help minimize unwanted complications from brain tumors!\nAs soon as there are signs of a brain tumor - see your general practitioner for a timely diagnosis\n\nHow to diagnose brain tumors\nDiagnosing a brain tumor begins with a detailed assessment of your nervous system reflexes. To check to see if your cranial nerves are still working well, your doctor will conduct many tests such as:\nUse an ophthalmoscope: To see how your pupils react to light.; Test muscle strength: Hand and foot coordination, balance ability, temporary memory ability as well as arithmetic calculation ability.\nThen, your doctor will ask you to perform one or more tests to get an accurate conclusion. These tests may include:\nSkull X-ray: Uses X-rays to detect microscopic skull fractures caused by brain tumors. If the tumor metastasizes into the blood, X-rays can also detect it; Head CT scan: Still uses X-rays but gives more detailed images than X-rays with the help of a computer. CT scans help doctors see the internal structures of the brain and the vascular system more clearly.; Head MRI: Also known as magnetic resonance imaging, provides superior image quality compared to CT scanning, clearly depicting brain parenchyma thanks to higher contrast.\nAngiogram: You will have dye injected into your arteries. This method allows doctors to monitor how well the blood supply is feeding the tumor.\nBiopsy sample: A small piece of brain tumor cells will be extracted and tested to determine the tumor stage and tumor type (primary or secondary).\n\nTreatment of brain tumors\nThe brain is the body's only irreplaceable organ, so brain tumor surgery still carries the risk of the tumor returning. Therefore, when treating brain tumors, doctors often combine 2 or more different treatment methods at the same time to increase effectiveness. In there:\nSurgery: Is the most common treatment for brain tumors. The goal is to remove as much cancer as possible without causing damage to healthy parts of the brain.; Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy uses anti-cancer drugs to kill brain tumor cells. The medicine will circulate throughout your body through the bloodstream.; Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy is the most common treatment for malignant brain tumors, using high-energy rays such as Beta rays, X-rays or Gamma rays to treat brain and spinal cord tumors.; Taking steroids: Once diagnosed with a brain tumor, steroids may be prescribed to help reduce swelling around the tumor.; Adjunctive medications: Medications may be used to treat other symptoms of a brain tumor, such as anti-seizure medications for seizures and pain medications for headaches.\n\nBrain tumor prevention\nBrain tumors cannot be completely prevented because the main cause of brain tumors is still unknown. You can only prevent brain tumors by minimizing potential risks such as:\nGive up bad habits: Drinking alcohol, smoking, staying up late, living irregularly; Eat healthy: Rich in fruits and vegetables, vitamin C and limit foods rich in Nitrite such as smoked spray, canned food, fast food, grilled and fried foods.; Increase exercise: Exercise to improve general health; Stay away from radioactive sources: Limit exposure to excessive radioactive sources and ionizing radiation such as X-ray machines, CT scan machines,... and from other special machines.\n\nFrequently asked questions about brain tumors\nAre brain tumors hereditary?\nBrain tumors can be hereditary, but the rate is so RARE that it is considered almost NOT hereditary. Only 5-10% of all cancers in the world are due to genetics and only 2% of all cancers are due to brain tumors. Simply put, only 0.1%-0.2% of all cancer cases worldwide are due to hereditary brain tumors, so you absolutely do not need to worry.\nCan benign brain tumors be cured?\nBenign brain tumors can be cured with surgery if treated early, when the tumor is completely removed and has not left too far-reaching consequences. The possibility of recurrence after surgery of benign brain tumors is quite low, so the cure rate of benign brain tumors is very high.\nCan malignant brain tumors be cured?\nMalignant brain tumors CAN be cured and they CAN NOT be cured. Prognosis (success rate) when treating malignant brain tumors depends entirely on the following factors:\nTumor type: Stage 3 and 4 brain tumors have a worse prognosis than stages 1 and 2; Tumor location: The more important the tumor is (for example, near the optic nerve), the greater the risk. The deeper the brain tumor is in the brain, the more difficult it is to operate.; Tumor size: The larger the brain tumor, the lower the prognosis for cure; Extent and speed of metastasis: Brain tumors that metastasize quickly have a lower cure prognosis than brain tumors that metastasize slowly; Degree of tumor response: The more \"stubborn\" the tumor is to the drug, the worse the prognosis; General health: The more positive your general health information (age, family history, underlying medical conditions, etc.) is, the higher the chance of curing a brain tumor. The outlook for treatment of malignant brain tumors is often better for people under 40 years of age.; Other factors: Other abnormal signs of cells, tumor shape, possibility of recurrence,...\nWhen to see a doctor?\nSee your doctor immediately if you have signs of a brain tumor such as seizures, dizziness, lightheadedness, or headaches. Especially, if you have a headache that is different from the types of headaches you often experience such as:\nHeadache is getting worse; Headache every morning when waking up.; Headache every time you move, sneeze, cough or move your body.\nAs soon as the above signs appear, you should immediately go to the nearest general practitioner to get the earliest diagnosis. The first and only in Vietnam, Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City applies the most modern Modus V Synaptive Brain Surgery Robot in brain tumor surgery as well as dangerous neurological and cranial diseases.\nThanks to the ability to harmonize MRI, DTI, CT, DSA images... - which no machine or technique has been able to do before, the Modus V Synaptive Robot helps doctors clearly see brain tumors or damaged brain areas. injuries in relation to nerve conduction bundles, healthy brain tissues... on the same vivid 3D image, with many different dimensions.\nThe robot also allows doctors to perform 3D simulation surgery before starting the actual surgery, thereby proactively choosing a safe path to approach the tumor, without damaging healthy nerves and brain tissue, ensuring the avoidance of harm. maximize the risk of postoperative complications.\nDuring official surgery, the Modus V Synaptive Robot also has the function of monitoring throughout the surgery process, warning with light signals (red - yellow - blue) to help doctors operate safely, ensuring surgical lines and equipment. The operated object is inserted into the brain at the correct position established in the simulated surgery. This helps bring outstanding efficiency to the surgical process, helping to maximize brain tumor resection, allowing the patient to recover quickly, return home early, and preserve the patient's functions at the highest level. The cost of performing surgery with the Modus V Synaptive Robot is also saved dozens of times compared to robotic surgery abroad.\nTo schedule an examination and consultation on health issues in general and brain tumor diagnosis and treatment in particular at Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nAbove is the most basic information you need to know about brain tumors. Hopefully through this article you somewhat know what brain tumors are, what causes brain tumors, what are the signs and symptoms of brain tumors to prevent the disease.\nHowever, health checks in general and periodic brain tumor screening in particular still play an important role in effective disease prevention. Because the longer a brain tumor lasts, the more damage it causes to health and threatens life. Contact Tam Anh General Hospital System immediately if you have any signs of a brain tumor such as headaches, dizziness, seizures, etc. to be examined and screened promptly.",

However, the tumor compresses the nerves causing pain and can cause loss of muscle control.\nThe earlier a brain tumor is detected, the higher the prognosis for cure. So what are the early signs of brain tumor?",
            "subsection_string": "Classification of brain tumors\nThe brain is made up of countless different tissues and cells, so it can develop into many types of tumors. There are more than 130 different types of brain tumors with typical brain tumor signs. In particular, diseases are divided into groups including:\nDivided by origin: Brain tumors include 02 types: primary brain tumors and secondary brain tumors.; Divided by nature: Brain tumors include 02 types: benign brain tumors and malignant brain tumors.; Divided by level: Brain tumors include 04 types: brain tumors level 1, level 2, level 3, level 4.\nPrimary brain tumors and secondary brain tumors\nPrimary brain tumor\nPrimary brain tumors are brain tumors that form and develop on their own from cells of the brain and central nervous system (not due to transmission from other areas of the body). The cause of a primary brain tumor can also occur in the spinal cord, meninges (area covering the brain) or nerves leading from the brain.\nCharacteristics: 70% of primary brain tumors are benign (non-cancerous) brain tumors but 30% are malignant (cancerous) tumors. Primary brain tumors can be easily removed and completely cured if they are benign tumors.; Prevalence: The rate of cancer from primary brain tumors accounts for only 2% of the total number of cancer cases from other parts of the body.; Subject: The older people are, the more likely they are to develop primary brain tumors. Almost 25% of patients diagnosed with primary brain tumors in the UK are aged 75 or over. In addition, primary brain tumors are the second most common cancer (after acute lymphoblastic leukemia) in children under 15 years old.\nSecondary brain tumor\nSecondary brain tumors are tumors that appear in the brain because cancer cells from another organ (such as the lungs) have spread to the brain. Any type of cancer in the body, if not detected promptly, can metastasize, leading to secondary brain cancer.\nCharacteristics: Secondary brain tumors are always malignant tumors. In about 50% of cases, the cause of secondary brain tumors is metastasis from lung cancer, followed by metastasis from breast cancer, kidney, skin, colon, melanoma,...; Popularity: Secondary brain tumor cases account for 50-80% of the total number of brain tumor cases today, which is nearly four times the number of primary brain tumor cases.; Subjects: According to statistics, secondary brain tumors are common in the elderly group (aged 70 and older) and have a high risk of appearing in any subject who has or has a history of cancer.\nBenign brain tumors and malignant brain tumors\nBenign (non-cancerous) brain tumors\nDefinition: A benign brain tumor is a type of brain tumor that grows slowly, does not metastasize, and can be completely treated by surgically removing the tumor directly without the need for radiotherapy or chemotherapy.; Characteristics: Although benign tumors can be cured, they can still be life-threatening if not promptly removed through surgery. The disease is less likely to recur after surgery if it is completely removed. Therefore, you need to proactively have regular health checks to screen and early detect benign tumors (if any).\nMalignant brain tumor (cancer)\nDefinition: A malignant brain tumor is a type of brain tumor that contains cancer cells (cells that divide rapidly beyond control). This tumor easily attacks and metastasizes to neighboring healthy cells. The disease develops quickly, relapses easily and directly affects the patient's life.; Characteristics: When a patient has a malignant tumor, the treatment method is often a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. Malignant brain tumors account for nearly 30% of all primary brain tumors, while secondary brain tumors (due to metastasis) are 100% malignant.\nClassify tumors by grade\nThis classification divides brain tumors into 4 levels (also known as 4 stages) from stage 1 to stage 4.\nTo determine the grade (stage) of the tumor, the doctor will base it on the shape characteristics of the tumor cells observed under a microscope. The more normal the tumor cell sample looks (similar to healthy cells), the lower the brain tumor grade.\nBiological characteristics and treatment methods for brain tumors at each level also have big differences:\nBrain tumor grade / stage  Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Stage 4  Tumor cell identity  Looks a lot like healthy brain cells  Looks less like healthy brain cells Cells look more abnormal . The cells look very abnormal. Likelihood of growing, spreading  Slow, unlikely to spread Slow, possibly spreading Fast, easily spreading into other parts of the brain and spinal cord Fast, very contagious  Possibility of recurrence Less Likely High Very high  Treatment Surgery Surgery is the main thing, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy (if needed) You are more likely to need radiotherapy and chemotherapy after surgery. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy\nSome common types of brain tumors\nCurrently, there are 4 common types of brain tumors: (2)\nGliomas: Also called gliomas because they are brain tumors that start in glial cells in the brain or spinal cord. Gliomas are a type of malignant primary brain tumor, accounting for about 50.4% of all brain tumor cases and 78% of malignant primary brain tumor cases.; Meningioma: A slow-growing tumor that forms from the meninges or membrane surrounding the spinal cord. Meningiomas are benign tumors that often appear in women, accounting for about 20.8% of all brain tumor cases with a low recurrence rate after surgery (less than 20%).; Pituitary adenoma: A tumor that occurs in the pituitary gland (located on the surface below the brain) with more than 60% of cases diagnosed as benign, 35% as invasive tumors. According to statistics, pituitary tumors account for 10% - 25% of all brain tumors and the incidence can be up to 17% of the population.; Peripheral nerve tumors: Caused by fibroblasts that grow around nerve bundles and account for about 10% of all brain tumors. Most peripheral nerve tumors are benign (not cancerous). However, the tumor compresses the nerves causing pain and can cause loss of muscle control.\nThe earlier a brain tumor is detected, the higher the prognosis for cure.

            "subsection_content": "Are brain tumors hereditary?\nBrain tumors can be hereditary, but the rate is so RARE that it is considered almost NOT hereditary. Only 5-10% of all cancers in the world are due to genetics and only 2% of all cancers are due to brain tumors. Simply put, only 0.1%-0.2% of all cancer cases worldwide are due to hereditary brain tumors, so you absolutely do not need to worry.\nCan benign brain tumors be cured?\nBenign brain tumors can be cured with surgery if treated early, when the tumor is completely removed and has not left too far-reaching consequences. The possibility of recurrence after surgery of benign brain tumors is quite low, so the cure rate of benign brain tumors is very high.\nCan malignant brain tumors be cured?\nMalignant brain tumors CAN be cured and they CAN NOT be cured. Prognosis (success rate) when treating malignant brain tumors depends entirely on the following factors:\nTumor type: Stage 3 and 4 brain tumors have a worse prognosis than stages 1 and 2; Tumor location: The more important the tumor is (for example, near the optic nerve), the greater the risk. The deeper the brain tumor is in the brain, the more difficult it is to operate.; Tumor size: The larger the brain tumor, the lower the prognosis for cure; Extent and speed of metastasis: Brain tumors that metastasize quickly have a lower cure prognosis than brain tumors that metastasize slowly; Degree of tumor response: The more \"stubborn\" the tumor is to the drug, the worse the prognosis; General health: The more positive your general health information (age, family history, underlying medical conditions, etc.) is, the higher the chance of curing a brain tumor. The outlook for treatment of malignant brain tumors is often better for people under 40 years of age.; Other factors: Other abnormal signs of cells, tumor shape, possibility of recurrence,...\nWhen to see a doctor?\nSee your doctor immediately if you have signs of a brain tumor such as seizures, dizziness, lightheadedness, or headaches. Especially, if you have a headache that is different from the types of headaches you often experience such as:\nHeadache is getting worse; Headache every morning when waking up.; Headache every time you move, sneeze, cough or move your body.\nAs soon as the above signs appear, you should immediately go to the nearest general practitioner to get the earliest diagnosis. The first and only in Vietnam, Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City applies the most modern Modus V Synaptive Brain Surgery Robot in brain tumor surgery as well as dangerous neurological and cranial diseases.\nThanks to the ability to harmonize MRI, DTI, CT, DSA images... - which no machine or technique has been able to do before, the Modus V Synaptive Robot helps doctors clearly see brain tumors or damaged brain areas. injuries in relation to nerve conduction bundles, healthy brain tissues... on the same vivid 3D image, with many different dimensions.\nThe robot also allows doctors to perform 3D simulation surgery before starting the actual surgery, thereby proactively choosing a safe path to approach the tumor, without damaging healthy nerves and brain tissue, ensuring the avoidance of harm. maximize the risk of postoperative complications.\nDuring official surgery, the Modus V Synaptive Robot also has the function of monitoring throughout the surgery process, warning with light signals (red - yellow - blue) to help doctors operate safely, ensuring surgical lines and equipment. The operated object is inserted into the brain at the correct position established in the simulated surgery. This helps bring outstanding efficiency to the surgical process, helping to maximize brain tumor resection, allowing the patient to recover quickly, return home early, and preserve the patient's functions at the highest level. The cost of performing surgery with the Modus V Synaptive Robot is also saved dozens of times compared to robotic surgery abroad.\nTo schedule an examination and consultation on health issues in general and brain tumor diagnosis and treatment in particular at Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nAbove is the most basic information you need to know about brain tumors. Hopefully through this article you somewhat know what brain tumors are, what causes brain tumors, what are the signs and symptoms of brain tumors to prevent the disease.\nHowever, health checks in general and periodic brain tumor screening in particular still play an important role in effective disease prevention. Because the longer a brain tumor lasts, the more damage it causes to health and threatens life. Contact Tam Anh General Hospital System immediately if you have any signs of a brain tumor such as headaches, dizziness, seizures, etc. to be examined and screened promptly.",
