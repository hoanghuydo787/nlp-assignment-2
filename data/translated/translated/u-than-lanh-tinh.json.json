In terms of scientific principles, the disease is not dangerous, but there are still unusual symptoms that affect the patient's health and life and pose a potential risk of developing malignant tumors. How to identify tumors and some prevention and treatment measures... will be shared by Urology and Nephrology experts in the article below.\n\nWhat is a benign kidney tumor?\nBenign kidney tumor is a condition in which the tumor forms and grows in the kidney, but is unable to metastasize to other parts of the body. Sometimes, the size of the tumor can grow, pressing on nearby internal organs and tissues. (first)\nBenign growths are very common and can form anywhere in the human body. When discovered, they can cause anxiety and fear. However, the fortunate thing is that most tumors are benign.\nAny of us can develop a benign tumor, including children. However, statistical results show that older people are more likely to develop tumors than other groups.\nThe tumor forms and grows in the kidney, but is unable to metastasize to other organs.\n\nTypes of benign kidney tumors\nAccording to experts at the Center for Urology and Nephrology, Tam Anh General Hospital System, benign kidney tumors are often classified according to where they develop, including the following types: (2)\n1. Renal adenoma\nAdenomas form in the thin layer of tissue that covers glands, organs, and other internal structures. For example, polyps form in the colon, liver... In the kidney, kidney tumors (Adenoma) appear a lot and are characterized as benign. Each of these tumors is usually about 2 cm in size, in the outer shell area separate from the kidney, gray or light yellow in color.\n2. Granulosa cell tumor\nOncocytoma is quite rare and occurs more often in men. This tumor is formed from large epithelial cells, about 12 cm in diameter, yellow or light brown in color. Granulosa cell tumor is also a benign kidney tumor, so it has very little risk of invading neighboring tissues.\n3. Renal fatty leiomyoma\nCompared to the two types of benign tumors mentioned above, renal liposarcoma is the rarest type, but has a higher risk of developing into a malignant tumor. This tumor formation is related to tuberous sclerosis, a neurological syndrome related to genetic disorders and genotypes that cause epilepsy and mental retardation...\n4. Single kidney cyst\nA single kidney cyst is a condition in which an abnormal mass of fluid appears on one or both sides of the kidney. This tumor is usually round, has fluid inside and does not invade the renal pelvis. This case often appears in older people. The older a person is, the higher the risk of having a simple kidney cyst.\n\nCauses of benign kidney tumors\nThe causes of benign kidney tumors are very diverse and are still one of the issues of concern to experts. Specifically:\nBecause patients have kidney diseases, but do not receive timely and correct treatment, kidney tumors appear.; Because patients use drugs that inhibit the enzyme monoamine oxidase to treat depression, stimulants, etc., it causes kidney tumors.; Because the patient has problems related to genetic disorders such as glial fibrosis 1, hereditary disease multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1...; Because patients have unscientific living habits: unhealthy eating, lack of exercise, taking medication incorrectly as prescribed, smoking...\nIn fact, almost anyone can develop a benign kidney tumor. However, risk factors belong to the group:\nFor people aged 20-50, the risk tends to increase with age; Men are more susceptible to kidney tumors than women; People often have health problems\nPeople who regularly take medication incorrectly as prescribed are susceptible to kidney tumors.\n\nSigns of benign tumors in the kidney\nDepending on the location of the benign tumor, the patient will have specific symptoms or not. Even in many cases, benign kidney tumors are not detected because the patient does not have any symptoms. But in general, signs of a benign kidney tumor include:\nHypertension: This is one of the typical symptoms of benign kidney tumors. Patients with high blood pressure, sudden and dangerous to their health.; Abnormal increase in heart rate: In many cases, it increases to 180 beats/minute; Skin color is pale, pale, tired, weak, weight loss; Headache whose cause cannot be found; Nausea, difficulty breathing, chills, or sweating; Have digestive problems such as constipation; Insecure, worried, restless mood\nMost cases of benign kidney tumors have no symptoms, but specific groups such as pregnant women, manual workers... will have more serious and easily recognizable symptoms.\n\nAre benign kidney tumors dangerous?\nBenign kidney tumors are almost always not life-threatening, but unusual symptoms can affect the patient's quality of daily life. Even though kidney tumors are benign, experts recommend that you still make an appointment with your doctor as soon as you detect unusual signs for advice and instructions on some health monitoring and care measures. Because in many cases tumors can become malignant over time and early detection has great significance for the effectiveness of later treatment.\n\nDiagnosis of benign kidney tumors\nTo diagnose benign kidney tumors, doctors use many different methods. The key to diagnosis is determining whether the tumor is benign or malignant. Clinical and paraclinical methods are performed as follows:\nClinical examination\nThe doctor may start with a physical examination and collecting medical history, discussing the symptoms the patient is experiencing.\nParaclinical diagnosis; Blood tests evaluate kidney function through indicators: creatinine, urea, uric acid...; Urine analysis to find red blood cells, white blood cells, adrenal hormone levels...; Ultrasound to evaluate the number, size, structure of tumors...; Computed tomography (CT scan) helps determine the characteristics of benign kidney tumors, the functioning of the remaining kidney...; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) are also indicated to check the location, size, and nature of the tumor; Nephrography with contrast helps to look for compression on the kidney parenchyma and distinguish it from other kidney diseases, specifically hydronephrosis; Genetic testing may be indicated to determine risk factors for benign kidney tumors, especially for Familial Polyp Syndrome and hereditary multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.; Kidney tumor biopsy to diagnose benign or malignant kidney tumors, helping doctors come up with appropriate treatment plans.\n\nPrevention of benign kidney tumors\nRecognizing the risk factors that contribute to kidney tumors can help you build a scientific, healthy lifestyle, contributing to reducing the risk of cancer. According to Urology and Nephrology experts, below are the best ways to prevent kidney tumors:\nLimit and make efforts to completely stop using tobacco and stay away from cigarette smoke; Build a healthy, balanced diet by:; Limit your intake of processed meats; Adopt diets that focus on plant-based foods, lean protein and healthy fats; Avoid drinking alcohol or drink in moderation; Maintain a reasonable weight by increasing physical activity for at least 30 minutes/day; Shield your body from the sun; Get vaccinated against viral infections that can lead to kidney cancer, such as hepatitis B and HPV.; Do not use medicine, especially prescription medicine, without a doctor's prescription; Pay attention to your health and follow a regular health care schedule to screen for types of cancer promptly and bring high treatment effectiveness.\nVaccination against hepatitis B and HPV is one of the effective measures to prevent kidney tumors.\n\nThe treatments\nNot all benign kidney tumors require treatment. If the patient's tumor is small and does not cause any symptoms, the doctor may prescribe some periodic monitoring measures. If the doctor prescribes treatment, the specific method will depend on the location of the tumor, the risk of affecting internal organs, nerves, blood vessels... (3)\n1. Laparoscopic surgery\nTumor surgery is often performed using endoscopic techniques to limit the risk of invasion, make smaller incisions, reduce bleeding and shorten recovery time. When performing this method, the patient may need to stay in the hospital for 1-2 days to wait for stabilization and discharge.\n2. Open surgery\nRecovery time after open surgery is proportional to the level of invasive intervention. After the tumor has been removed, the patient may need occupational therapy or specialized care to address the problems left by the tumor.\nIf surgery cannot safely reach the tumor, your doctor may prescribe additional methods to reduce the size of the tumor or prevent its growth.\nCenter for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology - Urology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts, Internal Medicine and Surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
