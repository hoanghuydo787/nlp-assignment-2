    "content": "Mediastinal tumor: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis and prevention\n\nBenign and malignant mediastinal tumors, including tumors from the thymus, nerves, lymphoid tissue (lymph nodes, connective tissue, or germ cells), can affect the function of the muscles. neighboring authorities if not intervened early.\n\nWhat is a mediastinal tumor?\nMediastinal tumor is a tumor that forms in the mediastinal area. They can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Mediastinal tumors are likely to appear in the anterior or posterior part of this area. Tumor location depends on the patient's age. Statistics show that tumors developing in the posterior part of the mediastinum are mainly found in children, while tumors in the anterior part of the mediastinum occur more frequently in adults.\nThe mediastinum is the area surrounded by the sternum in front, the spine in the back, and the lungs on either side. The mediastinum contains the heart, aorta, lymph nodes, thymus, esophagus, trachea, and nerves. (first)\n\nCauses of tumors in the mediastinum\nThe causes of mediastinal tumors are often related to their location: (2)\nAnterior mediastinum\nLymphoma: including Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma;; Thymoma and thymic cyst: are the most common causes of mediastinal tumors. The majority of thymoma are benign and surrounded by a fibrous capsule;; Germ cell: 60-70% of germ cell tumors are benign, common in both men and women;; Mediastinal thyroid mass: usually a benign tumor, such as a goiter.\nMiddle mediastinum\nBronchial cyst: is a benign growth originating from the respiratory tract;; Mediastinal lymphadenopathy: enlarged lymph nodes;; Pericardial cyst: primary malignant tumor of the pericardium;; Tracheal tumors: can be benign or malignant;; Esophageal tumors: can be benign or malignant;; Esophageal abnormalities: including esophageal dilatation, diverticula, and hip hernia;; Vascular abnormalities: including aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection.\nPosterior mediastinum\nNeuroendocrine tumors: are the most common cause of posterior mediastinal tumors, classified into nerve sheath tumors, ganglion cell tumors, and paraganglionic cell tumors. About 70% of neuroendocrine tumors are benign;; Lymphadenopathy: due to proliferation of lymph nodes;; Neurogenic cyst: is a rare tumor, related to both nervous and gastrointestinal factors;; Spinal abnormalities: including infectious abnormalities, malignant tumors, and thoracic trauma;; Vascular abnormalities: including aortic aneurysm.\n\nSymptoms of mediastinal tumor\nNearly 40% of people with mediastinal tumors do not exhibit symptoms. The tumor is often discovered during a chest X-ray to diagnose another health condition. (3)\nIf the following symptoms appear, it is because the tumor is pressing on surrounding organs:\nCough; Short of breath; Chest pain; Nausea and vomiting; Fever; Chills; Night sweats; Hemoptisi; Hoarseness; Unintentional weight loss; Lymphadenopathy; Wheeze; Ptosis, small pupils, and other eye problems\nPersistent coughing and coughing up blood are signs that the mediastinal tumor is compressing the lungs\n\nIs mediastinal tumor dangerous?\nAccording to Dr. Nguyen Anh Dung, Head of the Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, both benign and malignant mediastinal tumors need treatment. Without intervention, as tumors grow, they will compress surrounding organs and tissues, even affecting the function of these organs.\nMeanwhile, malignant tumors can spread to other areas of the body. If they invade the spinal cord, they will cause spinal cord compression. In case they invade the heart or blood vessels of the heart, the patient will face the risk of death.\nBesides treating medulloblastoma with surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy, patients may still experience serious side effects, such as:\nReduced appetite; Bleed; Anemia; Constipation; Diarrhea; Tired; Hair loss; Infection; Nausea, vomiting; Painful; Swelling\n\nDiagnostic method\nTechniques commonly used to diagnose and evaluate mediastinal tumors include:\nComputed tomography (CT) of the mediastinum; Blood tests; Supersonic; Biopsy; Chest X-ray; Chest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Esophagoscopy; Bronchoscopy; Mediastinoscopy with biopsy\nThe modern 768-slice CT scanning system at Tam Anh General Hospital helps detect mediastinal tumors early.\n\nMediastinal tumor treatment\nAccording to Dr. Nguyen Anh Dung, the treatment method applied to mediastinal tumors depends on the type of tumor and its location: (4)\nThymoma requires a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Doctors can perform minimally invasive techniques such as thoracoscopy, robotic resection, or with midsegmentectomy – an open approach that splits the sternum in half.; Lymphomas are treated with chemotherapy, followed by radiation therapy. Your doctor may also perform surgery to remove diagnostic tissue.; Neuroendocrine tumors that develop in the posterior mediastinum are treated surgically.\nSome tumors that are benign and have not affected surrounding organs are treated medically. The doctor will monitor their development and perform surgery when necessary.\nDoctors performed laparoscopic surgery to remove mediastinal tumors for patients at Tam Anh General Hospital\nAdvantages of minimally invasive surgery in treating medulloblastoma\nCompared to traditional surgery, patients who undergo minimally invasive surgery, such as thoracoscopic mediastinal tumor removal, will enjoy many benefits such as:\nLess pain after surgery; Shorter hospital stay; Faster recovery and early return to daily activities; Reduced risk of infection; Less bleeding during and after surgery\nRisks of surgery\nCompared with traditional open surgery, laparoscopic surgery to remove mediastinal tumors has helped minimize complications during and after surgery. However, there are still risks to this minimally invasive method. Those risks include:\nDamage to surrounding areas including the heart, pericardium, and spinal cord;; Bleeding heavily during surgery, the patient needed a blood transfusion and the doctor had to make a larger incision;; Pleural effusion;; Postoperative drainage;; Infection and heavy bleeding in the postoperative period.\nAt Tam Anh General Hospital, doctors will give specific instructions to help patients prepare well for surgery. In the post-operative period, the patient will also be given detailed instructions on how to care for the surgical wound, a suitable diet and a reasonable exercise regimen to quickly recover health.\n\nPrevention of mediastinal tumors\nDr. Nguyen Anh Dung said that mediastinal tumors cannot be prevented from forming, but they can be completely eliminated if detected and treated at an early stage. It is important that each person pay more attention to their health and have regular check-ups. In case of symptoms of chest pain, difficulty breathing, cough of unknown cause... lasting more than two weeks, you need to go to the hospital for examination. early.\nGathering a team of experienced experts in the field of cardiovascular and thoracic surgery, the Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital has successfully treated many cases of mediastinal tumors, in some cases The tumor is up to 10cm in size. The center prioritizes the development of modern, minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery techniques, helping to minimize the risk of complications for patients.\nIn addition, the Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital also examines and treats patients with other cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy. leg veins, congenital heart disease... The center is equipped with modern machinery systems such as 768-slice CT scanning system, DSA system - 2-plane coronary angiography, 4D ultrasound system... to help detect early disease and timely intervention.\nIf left untreated, mediastinal tumors can grow rapidly, seriously affecting the patient's health. Therefore, proactively check your health periodically for screening, early detection and effective treatment.",
