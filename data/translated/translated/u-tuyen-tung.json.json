Frequently asked questions include:\n What is a pineal gland tumor?\n,\nIs pineal gland tumor dangerous?\n,\n signal,\nWhat are the causes and how to diagnose pineal tumors in the brain?\n... The appearance of tumors in the pineal gland area is relatively rare, so it can cause difficulty or confusion in diagnosis. To learn more about this disease, please refer to the basic information in the following article.\n\nWhat is a pineal tumor?\nNowadays, many people may still feel strange when they hear the word \"pineal gland\". The pineal gland is a small endocrine gland in the skull, located near the center of the brain, and has the function of regulating the body's circadian rhythm (wake-sleep cycle). With its location deep in the brain parenchyma, surrounded by many blood vessels, surgical access to the pineal gland area is always a big challenge for neurosurgeons.\nPineal gland tumors appear in the pineal gland area, including tumors of the pineal gland components and tumors. This tumor has a high possibility of compressing the third ventricle, compressing the cerebral aqueduct and causing hydrocephalus. Not only that, tumors in the pineal gland area also cause compression of the cerebellum, upper brain stem and posterior fossa,... causing many disorders.\nAccording to many medical studies around the world, pineal gland tumors are quite rare. Research results show that the incidence rate is only about 0.4 - 1% in adults and 3 - 8% in children in the Americas and Europe (brain tumors). The disease appears more frequently in Asia with a rate of 3 - 9% (intracranial tumors). (first)\n\nCommon types of pineal gland tumors\nPineal gland tumors are not always diagnosed as cancer. However, even when benign, pineal tumors still cause many problems during development: pressing on other parts of the brain, blocking the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid, increasing intracranial pressure. .\nCommon types of pineal tumors: germ cell tumors, pineal parenchymal tumors, papillary pineal tumors, pineoblastoma, mixed pineal tumors\nPineal gland tumors include the following common types:\nGerm cell tumor\nGerm cell tumors are a group of primary tumors in the brain and are relatively rare. This type of cell tumor usually develops in children between 10 and 12 years old. Germ cell tumors commonly occur mainly in the pineal gland area and the suprasellar fossa area.\nPineal parenchymal tumor\nPineal gland parenchymal tumors include a group of tumors ranging from relatively benign to highly malignant. This is level II or III (intermediate level) and can occur at any age. Because they are intermediate level, these tumors still have a risk of recurrence after being removed.\nPapillary pineal tumor\nPineal papillary tumors (PTPR) occur only in the pineal region and occur most commonly in adults. Short-term headaches are a common symptom of papillary pineal tumors. Papillary tumors of the pineal region recur locally frequently, but occasionally metastasize to the spine. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified them as category II or III.\nCystoma\nPineal blastoma is a type of cancer that starts in the pineal gland. These cells grow rapidly and can invade and destroy healthy body tissues.\nCystoma can occur at any age and occurs most often in young children. Cystoma can cause headaches, drowsiness, and changes in the way the eyes move to become more abnormal.\nPineal gland tumors can be very difficult to treat. They can spread within the brain and into the cerebrospinal fluid. Surgery to remove this tumor is a necessary treatment.\nMixed pineal tumor\nThis is a combination of slow-growing and fast-growing cell types. Level I cells have the slowest growth and level IV cells have the fastest growth.\n\nWhat is the cause of a pineal gland tumor in the brain?\nCurrently, science does not have an exact answer about the causes of pineal gland tumors in the brain. However, the appearance of brain tumors can be due to the effects of risk factors such as: (2)\nObstruction of gland excretory ducts after traumatic brain injury\nInfection of the nervous system; Vascular diseases; Hormonal imbalance; Echinococcus bacteria eat into body cells.\nOr the cause of this tumor formation may also come from other congenital factors.\nIn addition, each person's body's genes and the impact of the environment are also factors that cause the formation of pineal gland tumors. In some cases, exposure to radiation or other genetic problems can also cause pineal tumors.\nThe causes of pineal tumors in the brain come from many risk and congenital factors\n\nSymptoms of pineal gland tumors\nHeadache and vomiting due to increased intracranial pressure\nAbnormally increased intracranial pressure is a signal of the presence of a tumor that blocks the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. Pineal gland tumors start silently, so sometimes they only cause fairly simple hydrocephalus and are easily confused with other common hydrocephalus diseases. (3)\nTo recognize increased intracranial pressure, do not subjectively ignore the following symptoms: headache, nausea, vomiting,Â  breathing disorders. These symptoms are very common in diseases such as digestive disorders, food poisoning, etc., so they can cause confusion. If patients have suspicious signs, they need to go to the hospital for a quick health check to help accurately diagnose the condition.\nIncreased cranial pressure signals the presence of a pineal gland tumor\nVision disorders\nAnother recognizable symptom of a pineal gland tumor is blurred vision, difficulty raising the eyes upward, and loss of focus of the two eyeballs (Parinaud's sign). The patient will have signs of difficulty concentrating, mental and personality disorders, gradual loss of coordination and endocrine disorders due to the tumor growing and compressing around the pineal gland area.\nOther clinical symptoms\nChronic headaches are also a symptom of a tumor forming in the pineal gland area. If this tumor is malignant and grows rapidly, the patient will have acute clinical manifestations as well as impaired consciousness or coma.\nSymptoms of pain in the back of the neck and back pain are also manifestations of this malignant tumor following the cerebrospinal fluid moving down the spinal cord. If the pineal gland tumor invades the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, it will cause diabetes insipidus and increase HCG levels. This will cause the patient to reach puberty early (before age 10).\nChronic headaches can also be a symptom of a pineal tumor\n\nIs pineal gland tumor dangerous?\nWhether a pineal gland tumor is dangerous depends on the nature, extent, and location of the tumor. Reality shows that pineal gland tumors are mostly malignant (up to 40%), but most will be sensitive to radiotherapy. Meanwhile, benign pineal gland tumors can be cured with surgery.\nThis shows that pineal gland tumors, whether benign or malignant, have positive treatment options. However, the negative effects of this tumor on the brain are a serious problem. Therefore, to achieve the best treatment results, patients need to proactively seek medical examination promptly to receive treatment as soon as possible.\n\nHow to diagnose pineal gland tumors\nFirst, your doctor will ask about your family history and any symptoms you are experiencing. You may also have a neurological exam to check your reflexes, eye movements, motor function, sensation, coordination and balance. If your doctor thinks you may have a pineal gland tumor, he or she may order additional tests, which may include:\nQuantification of AFP, HCG\nIf it is not an emergency, the doctor will not prescribe immediate surgery for a pineal gland tumor. At this time, the patient can undergo quantitative testing of AFP, HCG, and biopsy to be able to locate and determine the nature of the pineal tumor. This will help the doctor determine whether the tumor is benign or malignant.\nQuantifying AFP and HCG concentrations will allow doctors to monitor the effectiveness of treatment (if the treatment is effective, the concentration gradually decreases and is ineffective if the concentration does not decrease or increases). This measurement also allows the treating physician to assess the likelihood of recurrence of the pineal tumor.\nImage analysation\nImaging diagnostics that play the most important role in diagnosing pineal tumors are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT-Scan).\nYou may not know, CT-Scan images have good value in diagnosing pineal gland tumors. Pineal gland tumors often calcify within the tumor and will strongly enhance contrast medium. At the same time, the tumor will compress, causing blockage and dilation of the ventricles.\nMRI images will be valuable in diagnosing as well as predicting anatomical lesions of pineal gland tumors. At the same time, MRI images can also evaluate the size, morphology and level of invasion of the tumor.\n\nHow to treat pineal tumors\nTo get the correct treatment for a pineal gland tumor, the patient needs a biopsy to determine the nature and type of the tumor. (4)\nIf the pineal gland tumor is diagnosed as malignant, the patient will be prescribed radiotherapy. Most tumors in this area are relatively sensitive to radiotherapy, giving good results. On the contrary, if the tumor is benign, surgical removal will be indicated; If the patient has hydrocephalus, it is necessary to treat this problem first by endoscopic opening of the ventricle floor or ventricular and abdominal drainage. If the patient does not have hydrocephalus or has it at a mild level, many tests will be performed to determine the nature of this tumor.; Radiation treatment direction will be prescribed by doctors for germ cell tumors.\nA biopsy is needed to determine the nature of the tumor and then provide the most appropriate treatment\n\nHow to prevent pineal gland tumors\nThis tumor is often formed as a result of trauma, inflammation, vascular disease, and hormonal imbalance. Therefore, when suffering from the above problems, patients need to see a doctor early for timely treatment, helping to prevent the development of pineal gland tumors.\nBesides the effects related to the above diseases, pineal gland tumors can be congenital. To prevent this type of tumor, you need:\nHave a proper pregnancy management process; Prevents hypoxia in the fetus.; Limit placental insufficiency; Maintain healthy living habits, especially for women with the intention of becoming mothers in the future.; Prevents uterine infections; Do not use medication during pregnancy without your doctor's permission; There is special control over the negative Rh factor in the mother's body.\nIf you need to schedule an examination for a pineal gland tumor or other brain tumor issues, you can contact the Department of Neurosurgery, Neurology Center at Tam Anh General Hospital System:\nAbove is the information you need to know about pineal gland tumors. Although the disease is on the list of relatively rare diseases, people should not be too subjective. Regularly check your general health, or pay attention to typical signs and symptoms of the disease to promptly go to the hospital for examination and treatment.",
