So what is the cause of uterine fibroids during pregnancy? How to treat the disease so as not to affect health and fertility?…\n\nThings to know about uterine fibroids\nUterine fibroids are benign diseases with proliferation in the smooth muscle layer and connective tissue of the uterus, leading to the formation of tumors in the uterine muscle layer. The disease is divided into 3 groups: tumors located in the uterine muscle, tumors located under the serosa, and tumors located in the submucosa.\nAssociate Professor, Dr. Nguyen Duc Hinh, Director of the Center for Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, said that this is one of the common diseases in women of childbearing age and women turning 10 years old. premenopause – menopause.\nStatistics show that about 40-60% of women have uterine fibroids at the age of 35, 80% of women have fibroids at the age of 50. However, developing uterine fibroids during pregnancy is not easy because It is difficult to distinguish thickening of the uterine muscle during pregnancy from pathology. Therefore, statistical numbers may be lower than reality.\n\nCan you get pregnant with uterine fibroids?\n\"Can you get pregnant if you have uterine fibroids?\" is an issue that many women are concerned about. Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that when diagnosed with uterine fibroids, women should not worry too much because with the development of many modern techniques that have helped effectively treat the disease, women can still get pregnant. normal pregnancy.\nAs follows:\nIn cases where the fibroid is less than 5cm in size and does not cause complications, women can still have a normal pregnancy. However, throughout pregnancy, women need to strictly follow the doctor's examination schedule for close monitoring and timely and effective intervention.; In cases where the fibroid is larger than 5cm in size or the tumor is less than 5cm in size but causes dangerous complications, women need surgical treatment to remove the fibroid. After surgery, when your health has recovered, you can get pregnant\n“Recovery time after uterine fibroid removal surgery will be different for each person. Normally, women need about 1 year for the uterus to recover from damage. You should not get pregnant too early when the uterus has not fully recovered because it can increase the risk of miscarriage. Ideally, women should consult a doctor for examination and advice on when to be ready for a favorable pregnancy,\" Dr. Nguyen Duc Hinh recommended.\n\nWhy do you get uterine fibroids during pregnancy?\nCurrently, the main cause of uterine fibroids during pregnancy has not been clearly determined. However, doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that the female hormone Estrogen may be related to the formation and development of fibroids.\nEstrogen hormone is produced by the female reproductive organs, the ovaries. During pregnancy, the concentration of this hormone in a woman's body increases, which may be the reason leading to the development of fibroids.\nAn increase in estrogen hormone levels during pregnancy may be the cause of the development of uterine fibroids.\n\nSome symptoms of uterine fibroids during pregnancy\nThe uncomfortable and annoying symptoms of uterine fibroids can vary depending on the location, number and size of the fibroids. Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh shares some symptoms pregnant women may experience if they have uterine fibroids during pregnancy in each trimester as follows:\n1. In the first 3 months of pregnancy (first trimester)\nAt this stage, uterine fibroids are most likely to appear. Because at this time, the hormones in a woman's body have many changes, especially the increase in the production of the hormone Estrogen, while this is the hormone necessary for fibroids to nourish and develop.\nIf you have fibroids at this stage, pregnant mothers may experience either abdominal pain, abnormal bleeding, or both symptoms. A study of 4,500 pregnant mothers showed that 11% of pregnant mothers with fibroids experienced symptoms of abnormal bleeding, 59% of pregnant mothers only had abdominal pain, and 30% of pregnant mothers had both abdominal pain and bleeding in the second trimester. best.\n2. In the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (second and third trimesters)\nAt this stage, the mother's uterus needs to expand so that the fetus has space to develop, which causes the fibroids to be compressed. This is also the reason why pregnant mothers face many risks such as:\nFeeling pain: When the fibroid compresses or undergoes sterile necrosis, the pregnant mother will feel abdominal cramps. More dangerously, if the tumor increases in size but does not receive enough blood to nourish and grow, the pregnant mother may experience severe abdominal pain, increasing the risk of miscarriage.; Placental abruption: Uterine fibroids are one of the causes that cause the placenta to detach from the uterine wall even though the fetus has not yet been born. At this time, the fetus no longer receives nourishing blood from the mother, and the pregnant mother is at risk of blood loss. It can be said that placental abruption threatens the life of both the pregnant mother and the fetus.; Premature birth: Having uterine fibroids during pregnancy is also one of the causes of premature birth (giving birth before the 37th week of pregnancy) compared to pregnant mothers without fibroids.\nPregnant women with uterine fibroids may experience abdominal cramps throughout the three trimesters of pregnancy\n3. During labor\nMany studies show that pregnant mothers with uterine fibroids are 6 times more likely to have a cesarean section than other pregnant mothers. The reason is that if you give birth normally, the fibroids will reduce the uterine contractility, causing the cervix not to open. Some fibroids in the uterine isthmus can block the birth canal, affecting the passage of the fetus, causing difficulty and slowing down the birth process.\nIn addition, pregnant mothers with fibroids are more likely to give birth to a breech position, which means the fetus is in a breech position, with the fetus's buttocks in the lower part of the uterus. Therefore, obstetricians often prescribe cesarean section to ensure safety in these cases.\nAbout 3 to 6 months after giving birth, these fibroids will gradually decrease in size. Research shows that 70% of women who have given birth have fibroids that shrink more than 50% after giving birth.\n\nEffects of uterine fibroids on pregnancy\nWomen with uterine fibroids during pregnancy may face the following risks:\n1. Infertility – infertility\nFibroids (especially fibroids located near the endometrium) can change the endometrial layer, causing disadvantages for embryo implantation; or the tumor causes compression, bending the fallopian tubes, blocking the cervix...\nIf uterine fibroids are not treated effectively, they can affect women's fertility and disrupt marital happiness.\n2. Miscarriage\nUterine fibroids are the cause of repeated miscarriages because the endometrial layer does not fully develop and the uterine cavity is compressed. Statistics show that pregnant women with uterine fibroids have a higher risk of miscarriage in the first months of pregnancy than women without fibroids (the miscarriage rate is 7.6% when there are no fibroids, increases to 14% when fibroids are present). In particular, when the fibroid is large or has many fibroids, the risk of miscarriage increases.\n3. Premature birth\nWomen with uterine fibroids often have abnormal fetal position (breech position, transverse position, cephalic position) due to placenta attachment in abnormal positions (placenta previa, placenta accreta), or due to tumors. Compressing the uterine cavity, the risk of premature birth is very high.\n4. Causes difficulty in labor\nThe labor process in pregnant women with uterine fibroids will be very difficult and take longer. At the same time, the risk of needing a cesarean section is also higher than that of pregnant women without fibroids.\nPregnant women with uterine fibroids are 6 times more likely to have a cesarean section than pregnant women without the disease\n5. Postpartum hemorrhage\nUterine fibroids affect the uterus's ability to contract to stop postpartum bleeding. Therefore, fibroids can cause pregnant women to hemorrhage after giving birth. Immediately after giving birth, it is necessary to monitor the pregnant woman very closely to detect bleeding early and treat it promptly.\n6. Postpartum infection\nAfter giving birth, women are at risk of dyshidrosis and postpartum infections. In the case of bleeding during delivery of the placenta, if not detected and treated promptly, it can be life-threatening.\n7. Complications for the fetus\nThe fetus is at risk of malnutrition and low birth weight because the blood that nourishes the fetus is partly divided to feed uterine fibroids.\n“Having uterine fibroids during pregnancy can be dangerous for both the mother and the fetus. Therefore, if a woman is diagnosed with this disease or is preparing to become pregnant, she needs to have her pregnancy closely monitored by a good, experienced obstetrician to ensure a safe pregnancy, for both the pregnant mother and her child. The fetus is healthy,\" Dr. Nguyen Duc Hinh emphasized.\n\nHow to treat uterine fibroids during pregnancy\nDoctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that depending on each specific case such as location, number, size and annoying symptoms caused by fibroids, the doctor will prescribe a treatment regimen for uterine fibroids. Fit.\nNormally, doctors will prescribe medical treatment using Progesterone to reduce uterine contractions caused by fibroids and limit the growth of fibroids.\nAt full term or in labor, many cases of fibroids require cesarean section because of fibroids in the previa, because of abnormal position, because of old surgical scars... The attitude of treating fibroids (specifically whether to leave them or remove them) depends on depends on many factors such as size, location of fibroids, physician's experience, ability to resuscitate... If fibroids are left during cesarean section, the doctor will prescribe fibroid removal at the same time. 6-12 months after giving birth.\nThere are 2 types of surgery for uterine fibroids:\nOpen surgery to remove fibroids: Make an incision in the abdomen to open access to the uterus to easily remove fibroids.; Laparoscopic surgery to remove fibroids: Make a small skin incision near the navel to insert an endoscope with a camera attached at the end through the incision into the abdomen to remove the tumor.\nThe best option is usually to wait 6-12 months after giving birth to remove the fibroids. For older women who no longer need to have children, doctors may suggest hysterectomy to completely treat the disease, avoiding the risk of dangerous recurrence.\nDepending on each specific case of fibroid, the doctor will have appropriate instructions, ensuring safety for both pregnant mother and fetus.\nDoctor Nguyen Duc Hinh recommends that when diagnosed with uterine fibroids during pregnancy, pregnant mothers should consult a doctor for advice and instructions on how to properly care for them and avoid annoying symptoms. At the same time, follow the regular prenatal check-up schedule as prescribed by your doctor to closely monitor your pregnancy and provide timely and effective intervention, ensuring that the pregnant mother and fetus are safe and healthy.\nRefer to some foods to avoid when having uterine fibroids here.\nTam Anh General Hospital System's Obstetrics and Gynecology Center is invested in spacious facilities, possessing a modern machinery system, especially state-of-the-art ultrasound systems such as 2D, 3D, 4D ultrasound, Color Doppler ultrasound..., bringing together a team of skilled and experienced Obstetrics and Gynecology experts to take care of pregnant mothers and healthy fetuses from the early days of pregnancy until \"the mother is full and the baby is square\".\nFor advice and to make an appointment with Obstetrics and Gynecology experts at Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nHopefully the above information has helped women better understand uterine fibroids, and at the same time answer some information about uterine fibroids during pregnancy.
