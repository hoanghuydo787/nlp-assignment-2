    "content": "Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): Symptoms and treatment\n\nThe American Cancer Society says that ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is common in women, accounting for 20% - 25% of all new cancer diagnoses each year in the country [1]. The disease often has no symptoms and is only detected during breast cancer screening. So what is ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)? What are the symptoms and treatment?\n\nWhat is ductal carcinoma in situ?\nDuctal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is the presence of abnormal cells inside the milk ducts of the breast. DCIS is considered the earliest form of breast cancer, is non-invasive and has a low risk of becoming invasive. DCIS is often diagnosed through screening mammograms or the diagnosis of lump-like abnormalities in the breast.\nAlthough DCIS is not an emergency, it needs to be evaluated and treatment options considered. Treatment may include breast-conserving surgery combined with radiation therapy or mastectomy.\n\nCauses of ductal carcinoma in situ\nIt's unclear what causes DCIS. DCIS forms when genetic mutations occur in the DNA of milk duct cells. Genetic mutations cause the cells to appear abnormal, but the cells are not yet able to spread out of the milk ducts.\nResearchers don't know exactly what causes the abnormal cell growth that leads to DCIS. Factors that may play a part include lifestyle, environment and genes inherited from your parents.\n\nSigns of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)\nDCIS usually does not have any signs or symptoms. However, DCIS can sometimes cause signs such as:\nA breast tumor.; Nipple bleeding.; DCIS is often found on mammograms and appears as clusters of small microcalcifications of irregular shape and size.\n\nIs ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) dangerous?\nDuctal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is not life-threatening, however, if you have been diagnosed with DCIS, you have a higher risk of developing invasive breast cancer than the general population. .\nDCIS is considered the earliest form of breast cancer, is non-invasive and has a low risk of becoming invasive.\n\nRisk factors for DCIS\nAge is getting older; Personal history of premalignant lesions such as atypical hyperplasia; Family history of breast cancer; Never been pregnant.; Having your first child after 30 years old; Having your first period before age 12.; Menopause begins after age 55.; Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes increase the risk of breast cancer.\n\nDiagnosis of ductal breast carcinoma in situ\n1. Breast examination\nDuctal carcinoma in situ rarely appears as a lump, however, in some cases, the doctor may feel a small lump in the patient's breast.\n2. Breast ultrasound\nUltrasound is a technique that uses ultrasound waves to recreate the image and structure of the mammary gland, thereby helping to detect abnormalities of this organ. With a breast ultrasound, a technician will place a sound-emitting probe on the breast to perform the examination.\nIf the patient is under 30 years old, the doctor may recommend an ultrasound before a mammogram (mammogram) to evaluate whether the tumor is benign or malignant. On dense breast tissue, ultrasound can help diagnose DCIS early.\n3. Mammography\nDCIS is most often detected through breast cancer screening mammograms. If your mammogram shows clustered or branched microcalcifications that are irregular in shape or size, your radiologist will recommend additional mammograms for diagnosis.\nYou can get a diagnostic mammogram, taken at higher magnification from more angles. This exam evaluates both breasts and looks more closely at these microcalcifications for potential malignancy.\nCalcifications are small calcium deposits in the breast that appear as white spots on mammograms. Large, round, or well-circumscribed calcifications are more likely to be benign. Clusters of small, irregularly shaped microcalcifications suggestive of malignancy. If this breast lesion requires further evaluation, the next step is an ultrasound and breast biopsy.\n4. Screening magnetic resonance imaging shows DCIS\nMagnetic resonance imaging (breast MRI) uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the mammary gland. This is a non-invasive technique that does not use radiation, so it is safe for patients. [2]\nMagnetic resonance imaging helps:\nScreening people at high risk of breast cancer such as carrying BRCA gene mutations and pre-cancerous lesions; Check for abnormalities around the mammary gland.; Monitor cancer recurrence after treatment.\n5. Breast biopsy\nThe doctor uses a hollow needle to remove tissue samples from the suspected area, sometimes guided by ultrasound or mammography (3-dimensional stereotactic biopsy).\nBreast biopsy under 3-dimensional positioning: Breast tissue is pressed tightly between two mammography panels, 3-dimensional positioning determines the exact location for the biopsy. Then, use a core needle with vacuum support to remove some pieces of tissue from the suspected lesion to pathologically determine whether there are abnormal cells and what type.\nDuctal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is considered stage 0. Although it is not dangerous, it requires early treatment.\n\nTreatment methods for ductal carcinoma of the breast\n1. Surgery\nIf you are diagnosed with DCIS, one of the first decisions you will have to make is whether to treat it with a lumpectomy or a mastectomy.\nBreast conservation surgery (extensive tumor excision)\nWide tumor excision surgery is surgery to remove the DCIS area and a portion of healthy tissue around the lesion. This procedure allows you to retain as much breast tissue as possible and depends on the amount of tissue removed.\nThe study found that women treated with wide mastectomy had a slightly higher risk of recurrence than women who had mastectomy; however, survival rates between the two groups were very similar.\nMastectomy\nBreast reconstruction to restore the shape of your breasts can be done at the same time or later in the procedure, if you prefer. Most women with DCIS have surgery to remove the tumor. However, mastectomy may be indicated if:\nDCIS is large compared to breast size and wide surgical excision of the tumor does not provide cosmetic results.; There are multiple DCIS lesions (multifocal or multicentric disease), meaning in different quadrants of the breast.; After wide excision of the tumor, if the surgical margin is considered unsafe and there are still abnormal cells, additional tissue needs to be removed.; You cannot have radiotherapy after wide excision of the tumor: (1) the first trimester of pregnancy, (2) you have had previous radiotherapy to the chest or breast (3) you have a disease that is more sensitive to the side effects of radiotherapy such as systemic lupus erythematosus; You prefer a mastectomy rather than a wide excision of the tumor.\nBecause localized DCIS is non-invasive, the risk of axillary lymph node metastasis is very low and there is no need to remove axillary lymph nodes during wide tumor resection surgery. If DCIS has spread beyond the breast or the tumor may have spread beyond the milk ducts, a sentinel lymph node biopsy will assess the risk of axillary lymph node metastasis.\n2. Radiation therapy\nRadiation therapy uses high-energy beams, such as X-rays or protons, to destroy abnormal cells. Radiation therapy after wide excision of the tumor reduces the chance of recurrence or progression to invasive cancer.\nRadiation therapy is often used after wide excision of the tumor. But radiation therapy may not be necessary if you have only a small area of ​​DCIS that is considered low risk and has been safely removed surgically.\n3. Chemotherapy\nChemotherapy is not necessary for ductal carcinoma (DCIS) because the disease is non-invasive. [3]\nRegular breast cancer screening to detect mammary gland abnormalities early.\n4. Hormone therapy (hormones)\nHormone therapy is a treatment that blocks hormones from reaching cancer cells and is only effective for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Adjuvant endocrinology aims to reduce the risk of recurrence of DCIS or invasive breast cancer in both breasts.\nThe drug tamoxifen blocks the action of estrogen - a hormone that fuels some breast cancer cells and promotes tumor growth. Typically used for up to 5 years in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women.\nMenopausal women may also consider hormone therapy with medications called aromatase inhibitors, taken for up to 5 years, which work by reducing the amount of estrogen produced in your body.\nIf you choose a mastectomy, the risk of invasive breast cancer or DCIS recurring in the small amount of remaining breast tissue is very low and the need for supportive hormonal treatment is rare. Any potential benefit from hormone therapy will only apply to the opposite breast.\n\nPrevention of local ductal cancer\nNutrition: change to a healthy lifestyle through a diet of fruits, vegetables and whole grains.; Lifestyle habits: get enough sleep every night so you wake up feeling rested. Find ways to reduce stress in your life.; Exercise: try to be active for 30 minutes most days of the week.; Breast self-examination at home: check your breasts regularly. When you see any abnormal signs, you should go to the hospital to be examined immediately.; Screening: women 40 years of age and older should have a mammogram every year. [5]\nDepartment of Breast Surgery, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City with a system of modern equipment, imported genuine from European and American countries, and a team of experienced experts, multi-specialty coordination will bring Opportunities for good treatment of breast diseases in general and breast cancer in particular.\nDuctal carcinoma in situ is a common disease in older women. The disease often has no obvious symptoms. However, early detection and timely treatment are extremely necessary. The above article has provided information about ductal carcinoma of the breast (DCIS): symptoms and treatment. Hopefully this will be useful knowledge to help women proactively prevent, detect and treat the disease in the early stages.",
