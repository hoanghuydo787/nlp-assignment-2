    "content": "Stage 4 ovarian cancer: Symptoms, treatment and prognosis\n\nUpon receiving the diagnosis results\nStage 4 or stage IV ovarian cancer (final stage of the disease), patients are often confused, worried, even desperate. So how dangerous is stage IV ovarian cancer? How will patients with late-stage ovarian cancer be treated and how long will they live?\n\nWhat is stage IV ovarian cancer?\nStage IV ovarian cancer (final stage) is a phenomenon in which cancer cells originating from the ovaries or fallopian tubes or peritoneum have metastasized to distant organs outside the body's peritoneal cavity (such as liver, lungs, bones,...). At this time, treatment methods are meant to prolong life and reduce pain caused by disease symptoms for patients. (first)\nStaging of ovarian cancer according to FIGO\nOvarian cancer is a group of malignant diseases with tumor cells originating from the ovaries, fallopian tubes or peritoneum growing into them, and is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancies in women. . According to Globocan 2020 statistics, Vietnam recorded 1,404 new cases and 923 deaths due to the disease.\nMSc. Luu Thao Ngoc - Doctor of Oncology Department of Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, said that factors that increase the risk of ovarian cancer can include:\nGenetic factors: family history of having relatives with ovarian cancer, breast cancer or colorectal cancer; people carrying mutations in the BRCA1/BRCA2 gene, people with family members with ovarian cancer, people with Lynch syndrome),...; Other factors such as: advanced age, overweight and obesity, treatment of menopausal symptoms with hormone replacement, late childbirth (after 35 years old) or no childbirth,...\nMost patients are diagnosed in the advanced-metastatic stage, leading to a low 5-year survival prognosis. According to SEER 22 data (statistics from 2013-2019), the proportion of patients diagnosed in the distant metastasis stage is up to 55% and the 5-year survival rate is only 31.5%. Therefore, diagnosing the disease at an early stage and treating it promptly is very important.\n\nDecoding stage classification in stage IV ovarian cancer\nAccording to MSc. Luu Thao Ngoc, there are 2 staging systems used in ovarian cancer: the TNM staging system according to AJCC and the FIGO staging system of the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Based on stage classification and other factors on the patient, doctors will choose the most suitable treatment method for the patient as well as give a prognosis of survival. (2)\nAccording to the T, N, M stage classification system in cancer by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) is expressed as follows:\nTumor (T): Location and extent of tumor invasion.; Regional lymph nodes (N): Reflects metastasis to pelvic lymph nodes or para-aortic lymph nodes; Distant metastasis (M): Reflects metastasis to distant organs (such as bones, liver, lungs, etc.).\nAccording to the FIGO staging system, ovarian cancer includes stage I to stage IV:\nStage I (FIGO I): Tumor limited to the ovaries or fallopian tubes; Stage II (FIGO II): The tumor begins to invade organs in the pelvis.; Stage III (FIGO III): Tumor spreads to the peritoneum outside the pelvis or metastasizes to retroperitoneal lymph nodes; Stage IV (FIGO IV): Distant metastases (such as pleural effusion due to metastatic cancer, liver and spleen metastases, etc.).\nStage IV ovarian cancer according to FIGO classification will be divided into IVA and IVB, specifically as follows:\nStage IVA ovarian cancer\nCancer cells are detected in the pleural fluid (malignant pleural effusion).\nOvarian cancer stage IVB\nCancer cells have metastasized to lymph nodes outside the abdomen such as supraclavicular lymph nodes, inguinal lymph nodes, etc. to bones, organs in the body such as liver, spleen, lungs, etc. (3)\nSee more: 4 stages of ovarian cancer: detailed assessment and diagnosis.\n\nSymptoms of stage IV ovarian cancer\nLate-stage cancer often has typical signs and symptoms because at this point the disease has become more severe and has metastasized to other organs in the body, causing pain for the patient. According to MSc. Luu Thao Ngoc, patients with stage IV ovarian cancer may experience some symptoms such as:\nSystemic symptoms: fatigue, poor appetite, weight loss, pale skin, ascites,...; Abdominal and pelvic pain: cramping pain in the lower abdomen and pelvis; Pleural effusion: chest tightness and difficulty breathing due to cancer cells metastasizing to the pleura.; Neurological symptoms due to metastatic cancer such as: headaches, nausea, epilepsy, weakness...; Bone and joint pain: due to cancer metastasis to bones.; Intestinal obstruction: abdominal pain, nausea, bowel obstruction; Venous thrombosis: hypercoagulable condition causing thrombosis in limb veins,...\nAbdominal and pelvic pain occurs continuously, with increasing severity, causing patients to quickly become physically weak, depressed, and mentally depressed.\n\nHow long can you live with stage IV ovarian cancer?\nSo how long can stage IV ovarian cancer patients live? Based on the SEER 22 database (statistics from 2013 to 2019), the 5-year survival rate for stage IV ovarian cancer patients is about 31%. (4)\nHowever, this rate is only a prediction, the actual treatment results depend on many other factors such as pathology, the patient's general health status, treatment response, etc.\n\nThe goal of treatment for stage IV ovarian cancer\nAccording to MSc. Luu Thao Ngoc, completely eliminating ovarian cancer cells in the final stages is impossible, because by this time the cancer cells have metastasized to distant organs such as the liver, lungs, brain... The goal of treatment for stage IV ovarian cancer patients is to alleviate symptoms of the disease and prolong survival.\n\nHow to treat stage IV ovarian cancer\nThe treatment of stage IV ovarian cancer is complicated because the cancer cells have metastasized to distant organs. According to MSc. Luu Thao Ngoc, treatment methods focus on the following goals: eliminating cancer cells as much as possible, inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells, and minimizing symptoms caused by cancer. cause. (5)\nThe main treatment for stage IV ovarian cancer includes:\nStage IV ovarian cancer can be treated with tumor reduction surgery. After surgery, the patient will receive systemic treatment (with drugs such as chemicals, vascular antibiotics, etc.).; In some cases where surgery is not feasible from the beginning, the patient will receive neoadjuvant treatment aimed at shrinking the size of the tumor and metastatic lesions to make surgery more convenient and safer (with chemotherapy and targeted drugs can be used several cycles before surgery), then surgery is performed (also called inter-operative surgery), and systemic treatment continues after surgery with targeted chemicals/drugs, … There is a proportion of patients who do not respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens that will continue to be treated according to clinical trials or only symptomatic care.\nSurgery\nSurgery to reduce the total tumor mass (debulking) with total hysterectomy and 2 appendages, greater omentectomy, lymph node dissection and maximal removal of peritoneal metastases.\nValence\nThis is a method of using drugs that attack cancer cells to prevent their growth. Usually chemotherapy is used after surgery. However, recent studies show that the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy before surgery) has helped shrink tumors, minimize metastatic lesions, and make surgery convenient and safe. than. With stage IV ovarian cancer, chemotherapy is considered the main treatment method.\nCombination chemotherapy regimens between platinum chemotherapy agents (such as carboplatin) and taxane agents (such as paclitaxel, docetaxel) are commonly used and have proven effective in treating patients with ovarian carcinoma. egg.\nBesides the effectiveness of treatment, chemotherapy also causes unwanted side effects for the patient's body such as fatigue, nausea, hair loss, and affects hematological function (such as leukopenia, thrombocytopenia). ,…), liver-kidney dysfunction, etc. Therefore, before starting treatment, the doctor will discuss carefully with the patient about the benefits of treatment and possible side effects so that the patient can understand and notify the treating doctor when experiencing any unwanted side effects and the patient will receive supportive treatment when needed.\nTargeted therapy\nUnderstanding of molecular biological pathways leads to the development of targeted drugs to treat ovarian cancer such as anti-VEGF drugs (such as bevacizumab), PARP inhibitors (olaparib), ...\nImmunotherapy\nMSc. Dr. Luu Thao Ngoc said that immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy is a treatment that is of interest in the research of cancer diseases, including ovarian cancer, and holds great promise in treatment. against tumors. For example, anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody Pembrolizumab,...\n\nPalliative care for patients with stage IV ovarian cancer\nMSc. Dr. Luu Thao Ngoc said that in stage IV ovarian cancer, besides chemotherapy to control tumors and metastatic lesions, patients may experience late-stage disease symptoms and need treatment intervention. Treat concurrently with main treatment such as:\nIntestinal obstruction: may require surgical intervention such as colostomy to control symptoms, etc.; Ascites: large peritoneal effusion causes compression and discomfort for the patient, requiring intervention to evacuate the fluid. In case of rapid fluid re-establishment, the patient may be prescribed a drainage tube.; Some other treatments: such as blood transfusion, pleural aspiration, pain relief, nutritional enhancement,...\nPatients treated for stage 4 ovarian cancer need to coordinate closely with their doctors.\nBesides active treatment methods, Dr. Luu Thao Ngoc advises patients and families to note some of the following:\nEncourage, care, ask thoughtfully, and take care of the patient's life and spirit. Family members need to help the patient balance their emotions, avoid confusion, excessive worry, and despair about the condition.; Antiemetics or pain relievers can be used to relieve pain. You should talk to your doctor to use the correct dose and avoid abuse; Gentle, relaxing exercise such as walking, yoga, etc.; Develop a diverse menu to stimulate patients' appetite; Follow your doctor's treatment regimen, absolutely do not stop taking the medication arbitrarily or take the wrong dose as prescribed.\nTo find out information and schedule an appointment for examination, consultation and treatment of ovarian cancer at Tam Anh General Hospital, you can contact:\nFor patients who have been diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer, the treatment goal at this time is not to cure the disease but to provide palliative treatment, control symptoms and prolong the patient's survival time. . Relatives need to care, encourage and accompany the patient so that they can be optimistic and reassured according to the doctor's treatment regimen.",
