    "content": "Cervical cancer stage I (early stage): Symptoms and treatment\n\nPatients with stage I (early stage) cervical cancer often have no specific symptoms. Screening is the best way to detect disease early and treat it effectively.\n\nWhat is stage I cervical cancer?\nDisease stage reflects the degree of tumor development and metastasis. Determining the stage helps doctors make decisions about choosing the most optimal treatment methods for the patient.\nThe International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology (FIGO) classification system is often used in staging cervical cancer, including 4 stages denoted by Roman numerals from I to IV. (first)\nStage I cervical cancer (IA and IB) is diagnosed when the disease is limited to the cervix and has not spread to surrounding tissues or other organs.\nStage I cervical cancer has a good prognosis and highly effective treatment.\n\nStages in stage I cervical cancer according to the FIGO classification\nCervical cancer stage IA\nIn stage IA, the tumor growth is so small that it can only be seen under a microscope. (2)\nThis stage can be divided into 2 subgroups:\nCervical cancer stage IA1: Lesion depth < 3mm.\nCervical cancer stage IA2: Damage depth is from 3 - 5mm.\nCervical cancer stage IB\nAt this stage, the tumor is larger in size but is still limited to the cervix and has not metastasized far.\nThis stage can be divided into 3 groups:\nCervical cancer stage IB1: Lesions are ≥ 5mm deep and < 2cm wide; Cervical cancer stage IB2: Lesions have a depth of ≥ 5mm and a width of 2 - 5cm.; Cervical cancer stage IB3: Lesions are ≥ 4cm wide.\nSee more:\nCervical cancer stage II; Cervical cancer stage III; Cervical cancer stage IV\n\nSigns of stage I cervical cancer\nDr. Vu Huu Khiem - Head of Oncology Department, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, said that symptoms of stage 1 (early stage) cervical cancer are often unclear. The disease progresses over many years, so cervical cancer screening is the best way to detect abnormalities at this stage.\nStage I cervical cancer signs and symptoms may include:\nVaginal discharge with blood and vaginal discharge;; Vaginal bleeding after intercourse, between menstrual cycles or after menopause;; Menstruation may be heavier and last longer than usual.\nIf not treated promptly, the disease will progress through the following stages and cause symptoms including:\nDifficulty urinating, painful urination, sometimes blood in urine;; Diarrhea, pain or bleeding from the rectum;; Fatigue, weight loss;; Dull back pain or leg swelling;; Pelvic/abdominal pain.\nIf you have unusual vaginal bleeding or discharge or any other unexplained symptoms, you should have a complete gynecological exam including a Pap test.\nThe 5-year survival rate for stage I cervical cancer in the US is about 92% (according to SEER).\n\nDiagnosis of early stage cervical cancer\nPap test\nRegular gynecological examinations combined with Pap tests can detect most cases of cervical cancer. A Pap test (or Pap smear) is a method of collecting cells from the cervix, then checking for signs of pre-cancer, cancer or other benign diseases.\nHPV testing\nIf Pap results are abnormal, the patient is often further examined with an HPV test. This is a test to evaluate whether cells from the cervix are infected with HPV or not.\nThe patient lies supine on a gynecological examination table, and an instrument called a speculum is inserted into the vagina (this instrument will open the vagina). The doctor uses a brush-like tool to remove cells or dilate and curettage the cervix to take specimens for Pap tests and HPV tests.\nHPV testing is done if the Pap test is abnormal\nBiopsy\nThe doctor may also examine the cervix and take tissue samples for biopsy when malignant lesions are suspected. Many techniques can be used to obtain specimens, such as needle biopsy or apexification, etc.\n\nOther diagnostic imaging\nIf the biopsy results indicate malignancy, imaging tests will be performed to assess the stage of the disease, including:\nMRI of the pelvic area; CT scan of the chest - abdomen - pelvis or PET/CT; Bladder and rectal endoscopy; Hematology, biochemical tests, etc.\n\nTreatment of stage I cervical cancer\nSurgery is the main treatment for stage I cervical cancer. The choice of surgery will depend on many factors, including the patient's age, stage, and fertility wishes. (3)\nSurgery\nCut the tip of the cervix\nThis method can be prescribed for women with stage IA1 cervical cancer who still wish to have children. The removed tissue and the remaining surrounding tissue of the cervix will be evaluated pathologically. If no cancer cells are left in the cervical tissue, the patient may not need additional treatment. If there are cancer cells in the cut area, in blood vessels or lymph vessels, or the tumor is too large, the patient may need adjuvant treatment.\nCervical resection surgery\nCervicectomy involves removing the cervix, the upper part of the vagina, some structures and tissues around the cervix, and pelvic lymph nodes. This method can be indicated for stage IA2 and stage IB1 cervical cancer with small sizes (less than 2cm) when the patient still wishes to reproduce.\nHysterectomy\nHysterectomy is the removal of the uterus and cervix, including: partial hysterectomy or total hysterectomy, with or without lymph node dissection, total hysterectomy and 2 adnexa (ovaries, fallopian tube), radical hysterectomy.\nTotal hysterectomy is the most common treatment for women with stage I cervical cancer who no longer wish to have children.\nPortal lymph node biopsy\nPortal lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a method of taking lymph node specimens from the nearest lymph node where cancer cells can metastasize, then pathologically evaluating whether that node contains malignant cells. This method helps the surgeon decide the extent of lymph node dissection.\nRadiotherapy\nWhen the patient refuses surgery or cannot have surgery due to many reasons (such as accompanying medical and surgical diseases...), radiotherapy will be a radical treatment method for stage I cervical cancer. In addition, radiotherapy is also used after surgery in cases where there are remaining cancer cells after surgery or cancer cells have invaded blood vessels and lymphatic vessels according to pathology analysis results. (4)\nExternal beam radiation therapy alone or combined with brachytherapy is used to treat cervical cancer. External beam radiation therapy is usually given 5 days a week over a period of 6 to 7 weeks. Brachytherapy may be given in the final weeks of external beam radiotherapy or after external beam radiotherapy has ended.\nValence\nConcurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy will be used if the patient cannot have surgery or refuses surgery. Chemo-radiation therapy is also the main treatment method for cervical cancer stage IB2 or higher. In addition, this method can also be indicated after surgery in cases with high risk factors for recurrence on pathology results (such as remaining cancer cells at the surgical site, in blood vessels or lymph vessels). blood,…).\nChemotherapy treatment of cervical cancer at Tam Anh hospital\n\nSome frequently asked questions about stage I cervical cancer\nCan cervical cancer be felt with fingers in stage I?\nNo, you will not be able to feel cervical cancer with your fingers at this stage because the tumor size is still very small and can only be seen under a microscope. You should go to the hospital immediately if you notice an unusual mass inside the vagina.\nHow do I know if I have cervical cancer?\nMost patients will not know they have cervical cancer until they are diagnosed. The doctor will conduct tests and do a biopsy to determine the pathology. Early signs of stage I cervical cancer are often unclear and can only be detected through examination. Therefore, Dr. Khiem emphasized that comprehensive health examinations and periodic screenings are extremely important to help detect diseases early and treat them promptly.\nTo schedule an examination at the Oncology Department, Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nStage I cervical cancer has a good prognosis, treatment can be highly effective and women can still get pregnant and give birth after treatment. People with stage I cervical cancer should consult their doctor about choosing the best treatment methods that have little effect on fertility or postpartum birth control measures such as egg storage. for surrogacy.",
