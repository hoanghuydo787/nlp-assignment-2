    "content": "Stage II cervical cancer: Signs and treatment\n\nStage II cervical cancer has a relatively good prognosis. Treatment includes surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or a combination of these methods.\n\nWhat is stage II cervical cancer?\nStage II cervical cancer is cancer that has begun to spread outside the cervix and invade surrounding tissues, but has not invaded the lower 1/3 of the vagina and pelvic wall.\n\nClassification of stage II cervical cancer according to FIGO\nDisease stage reflects the degree of tumor development and metastasis. Staging helps doctors prescribe appropriate treatment for each patient.\nThe International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology (FIGO) classification system divides cervical cancer into 4 stages labeled I to IV. In particular, phase II is divided into IIA and IIB. (first)\nCervical cancer stage IIA\nAt this stage, the tumor has spread to the upper 2/3 of the vagina but has not invaded the tissue around the cervix (also called the paracervix), including:\nStage IIA1: Tumor size  ≤ 4cm.; Stage IIA2: Tumor size > 4cm.\nCervical cancer stage IIB\nAt this stage, the tumor has invaded the pelvic wall but has not spread to the pelvic wall.\nSee more: 4 stages of cervical cancer you need to understand in detail.\nCervical cancer stage I Cervical cancer stage III Cervical cancer stage IV; Stage I cervical cancer; Cervical cancer stage III; Cervical cancer stage IV\n\nSigns of stage II cervical cancer\nDr. Vu Huu Khiem - Head of Oncology Department, Tam Anh General Hospital Hanoi, said that signs of stage II cervical cancer include:\nAbnormal vaginal bleeding, between periods, after menopause;; Menstruation lasts longer or more heavily than usual;; Pain/bleeding after sex;; Pelvic pain;; Changes in vaginal discharge, such as increased discharge or discharge that has an unusual odor or color.\n\nSurvival prognosis for stage II cervical cancer\nAccording to Dr. Khiem, stage II cervical cancer has a 5-year survival rate of over 60%. In each individual, the survival rate may be different, this depends on many factors such as: (2)\nDisease stage.; Pathological type (adenocarcinoma, squamous carcinoma,...).; Age, general health condition.; Health problems or comorbidities, especially immunodeficiency or HIV infection; Newly diagnosed disease or recurrent disease; Treatments.; The body's response to treatments.\n\nDiagnosis of stage II cervical cancer\nTo determine stage II cervical cancer, during the examination, the doctor will ask about medical history, do a clinical examination and recommend a paraclinical examination. The results from examination and testing will help doctors plan treatment for patients.\nCervical cancer screening and examination help with early detection and timely treatment\nMethods used in diagnosing cervical cancer include: (3)\nColposcopy\nColposcopy is a method that helps observe images of lesions in the cervix. The doctor will place a speculum into the vagina and use acetic acid solution to apply to the cervix to observe abnormal areas. Colposcopy is often combined with biopsy when needed.\nCervical biopsy\nCervical biopsy is taking a tissue sample suspected of being malignant and then sending it for histopathological testing. The pathologist will look at this tissue sample under a microscope to look for signs of malignancy. There are many ways to biopsy the cervix, of which punch biopsy is the most commonly used procedure.\nDiagnostic imaging\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvic area\nIn cervical cancer, MRI scans help visualize tumor images and assess invasion status.\nCystoscopy, rectal endoscopy\nThis technique helps observe inside the bladder and rectum to find abnormalities and evaluate the invasiveness of the tumor.\nChest-abdominal-pelvic computed tomography or PET/CT: This method is used to evaluate the distant metastasis of the disease (such as lung metastasis, bone metastasis, etc.).\nBlood tests\nComplete blood cell analysis evaluates components such as the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nBlood biochemical tests evaluate body condition and organ function (such as urea, creatinine to evaluate kidney function; liver function such as AST, ALT, bilirubin,...).\n\nTreatment methods for stage II cervical cancer\nDoctor Khiem said that commonly chosen treatment methods for stage II cervical cancer include: (4)\nConcurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy (priority).; Surgery.\nChemotherapy and radiotherapy simultaneously\nThis is often the preferred method of choice in treating stage II cervical cancer. Radiation therapy in cervical cancer includes external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy. Doctors often combine these two methods together:\nExternal radiation therapy: A method of emitting radiation beams from a source outside the body (radiation generator) to the tumor. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a technique in external radiation therapy commonly used to treat cervical cancer, bringing good treatment effects as well as reducing unwanted effects.\nBrachytherapy: Also called “internal radiation therapy”, radiotherapy uses a radioactive source placed directly on or near the tumor.; Chemical drugs are used in combination with radiotherapy to increase the effectiveness of treatment. Cisplatin (or carboplatin) is often chosen.\nChemotherapy treatment of cervical cancer at Tam Anh General Hospital, HCM\nSurgery\nSome patients may be referred for surgery during this period. This method includes total hysterectomy, pelvic lymphadenectomy/abdominal para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Based on the postoperative pathology results, the patient may be considered for adjuvant treatment after surgery. The disease has a high risk of recurrence if there is one of the following factors such as: lymph node metastasis, vascular/lymphatic invasion, or residual tumor in the surgical area. If one of the high risk factors is present, the patient will receive adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy after surgery.\nDoctor Khiem advised that stage II cervical cancer is an early stage with a positive prognosis. Timely and correct treatment will give the patient a better chance of living after 5 years. Therefore, patients should go to reputable hospitals that specialize in Oncology, combined with other specialties such as Obstetrics and Gynecology to coordinate and standardize and choose the most optimal treatment methods.",
