    "content": "Late stage cervical cancer (4): Signs and treatment\n\nStage IV cervical cancer is late-stage cervical cancer. Prognosis of treatment is poor, survival rate after 5 years is only 15%.\n\nWhat is late-stage cervical cancer?\nLate-stage cervical cancer (stage IV) is the most severe stage. Malignant cells have spread to organs outside the cervix and uterus such as the bladder, rectum, bones, lungs, liver, etc.\n\nClassification of stage IV cervical cancer according to FIGO\nBased on the classification system of the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology (FIGO), doctors classify cervical cancer into 4 stages from I to IV. In particular, stage IV cervical cancer is divided into two stages IVA and IVB.\nCervical cancer stage IVA\nStage IVA is when the cancer has invaded nearby organs such as the bladder or rectum...\nCervical cancer stage IVB\nStage IVB is when the cancer has spread to distant organs, such as the lungs, liver, and bones.\nSee more: 4 stages of cervical cancer that women need to understand in detail.\nStage I cervical cancer; Cervical cancer stage II; Cervical cancer stage III\nNot only showing local symptoms such as vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain, stage IV cervical cancer patients also have pain in many places where the cancer has metastasized.\n\nPrognosis of late-stage cervical cancer\nThe 5-year survival rate in patients with late-stage cervical cancer is very low (about 15% according to SEER).\nThere are many factors that affect the prognosis of patients at this stage such as:\nAge: The older you get, the weaker your resistance and ability to respond to treatment. In elderly patients, there are many factors that predict survival beyond the stage of the disease such as comorbidities, nutritional status, compliance with treatment... Oncologists are always careful in choosing treatment regimen for the elderly patient group, ensuring a balance between treatment effectiveness and safety of the selected method.; General health status, accompanying medical and surgical diseases: The patient's whole body condition, accompanying diseases (such as cardiovascular disease, liver disease, kidney disease, etc.) are also factors that help doctors. Doctors consider choosing treatment regimens. The better the condition, the higher the response rate to treatment and the more improved the prognosis. With late-stage cervical cancer, treatment methods are only aimed at relieving symptoms and prolonging the patient's life. Treatment methods for stage IV are mainly systemic treatments (using chemicals, immunotherapy, targeted drugs, etc.), possibly combined with local treatments (such as symptomatic radiotherapy, etc.) will be considered based on each individual patient. In addition, nutritional issues should also be taken into account. When the disease is in its late stages, patients often show loss of appetite and poor appetite, leading to rapid physical wasting and easily falling into a state of serious malnutrition. A proper nutritional regimen is extremely important.; Treatment methods and treatment response: Not all patients at the same stage are treated with the same regimen, the choice will be based on each individual, as well as the experience of each doctor. clinical. Based on factors such as age, general condition, accompanying diseases, as well as oncological factors (such as pathology, molecular biological characteristics of the tumor, etc.), the patient will receive the most appropriate treatment. However, each patient's response to treatment is not the same. Some patients respond very well, while others do not respond, leading to having to move on to the next treatment steps. Individualizing patients and combining multispecialties will help improve treatment results.\n\nSymptoms of late stage cervical cancer\nSigns of late-stage uterine cancer are clearly revealed. In addition to signs suggesting pathology from the cervix such as abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, etc., symptoms of late-stage cervical cancer are also symptoms of the organ to which the cancer has metastasized, such as Bone pain due to bone metastasis, fecal leakage through the vagina, difficulty urinating due to tumor compression, headache due to brain metastasis,...\nSymptoms of cancer become more severe in the late stages, greatly affecting the patient's life. Therefore, palliative treatment (such as pain relief) is essential to improve the patient's quality of life.\n\nTreatment of late-stage cervical cancer\nTreatment of stage IVA cervical cancer\nStage IVA cervical cancer is currently prescribed a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\nRadiation therapy is treatment with high-energy X-rays that can kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy in cervical cancer is a combination of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy. Brachytherapy may be started in the final weeks of external beam radiotherapy or after external beam radiotherapy has finished.\nBefore the 1990s, the standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer was the use of external beam radiation and internal beam radiation therapy, which did not lead to any significant advances in the treatment of cervical cancer. supply for many years. However, recently the addition of concurrent chemotherapy to radiotherapy has improved treatment outcomes in these patients. Chemotherapy with cisplatin or carboplatin helps kill cancer cells and increases the effectiveness of radiotherapy.\nTreatment of stage IVB cervical cancer\nCervical cancer that has metastasized to distant organs will be very difficult to treat. Historically, patients with distant metastatic cervical cancer were considered incurable and rarely survived more than a year or two. Some patients are treated with chemotherapy to prolong life and relieve symptoms caused by advanced cancer. Other patients receive palliative care (such as pain relief, bleeding control, etc.).\nSystemic treatment is used for this stage, including immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted drugs. Can be treated alone or in combination with each other:\nImmune drugs: Anti-PD-L1 such as pembrolizumab,...; Chemical drugs: Cisplatin, carboplatin, paclitaxel,...; Targeted drugs such as: Bevacizumab,...\n\nPalliative care for patients with end-stage cervical cancer\nPalliative care for patients with advanced cervical cancer is the provision of medical, emotional, social and spiritual support. Palliative care aims to improve the quality of life of patients and their families in the face of a life-threatening condition. Palliative care not only provides health support for comprehensive treatment management, but also helps solve the patient's mental problems. Palliative care includes prevention and management of symptoms, pain relief, and psychosocial and spiritual support.\nPrevention and management of symptoms may include palliative radiotherapy to reduce tumor size, treatment of vaginal discharge, fistula, vaginal bleeding, nutritional issues, pain relief to name a few. for example in palliative treatment.\nPalliative care helps stage IV cancer patients improve their quality of life.\nStage IV cervical cancer can be considered a death sentence and is not easy to accept for the patient and family. However, with the development of medicine, treatment and palliative care methods are effectively applied to help prolong life and improve the quality of life for patients.",
