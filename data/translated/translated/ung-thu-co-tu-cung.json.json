    "content": "Cervical cancer: Causes, diagnosis and prevention\n\nAs one of the three leading cancer deaths in women, cervical cancer often has no obvious symptoms and progresses slowly, causing patients to be subjective and not treat early. However, if proactive prevention, screening and early detection, cervical tumor disease can be completely cured. Cervical cancer (UTCTC) has been a leading threat to the health and lives of women globally. According to statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), each year the world records more than 500,000 new cases and about 250,000 deaths. It is estimated that by 2030, the number of deaths due to this disease may increase to 443,000 people, double the number of deaths related to obstetric complications. (1) Vietnam alone records more than 4,000 new cases each year and more than 2,000 deaths. In addition, the cost of cervical cancer treatment is quite high, putting considerable pressure on economic resources. And this disease also has serious consequences for women's health, psychology, and happiness.\nCervical cancer is threatening the health and lives of women globally\n\nCervical cancer is what?\nCervical Cancer is a malignant disease of squamous epithelial cells or cervical glandular epithelial cells that develop abnormally, leading to the formation of tumors. in the cervix. These tumors multiply uncontrollably, invade and affect surrounding organs, most commonly metastasizing to the lungs, liver, bladder, vagina and rectum. (2)\n\nSigns of cervical cancer\nAccording to Dr. Hien Le, the initial symptoms of cervical malignant tumor are unclear, progress silently, and are difficult for patients to recognize. When symptoms appear more clearly, it means the cancer cells have spread. Treatment interventions at this time can still be effective, but are quite complicated and costly. In the worst case, women face the risk of removing the entire uterus, ovaries, and nearby lymph nodes, affecting motherhood. (3)\nSome signs of cervical cancer:\nPelvic burning pain or pain during sex;; Abnormal vaginal bleeding, especially after sex, between menstrual periods, after menopause or after gynecological examination;; Abnormal vaginal discharge, which may be more abundant, cloudy gray and foul-smelling;; Discomfort when urinating, frequent urination;; Urinating and bloody stools (warning signs of cervical cancer invading the bladder and rectum);; Irregular and prolonged menstruation;; Unexplained weight loss and fatigue.\nPelvic burning pain or pain during sex can be an early sign of cervical cancer\n\nCauses of cervical cancer\nWHO statistics show that about 99.7% of cervical cancer cases have the presence of HPV virus (Human Papilloma Virus). Therefore, HPV virus is considered the highest risk factor leading to this disease in women.\nHPV virus is a virus with more than 100 types, with about 15 types classified as high risk leading to cervical malignant tumors, the most common are types 16 and 18 (the cause of more than 70% of cases). in women), followed by types 31 and 45.\nMSc. Dinh Thi Hien Le - Senior Doctor of Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi said that HPV virus is mainly transmitted through sexual contact, in a few cases patients do not have sex. sexual contact, only skin contact but there is still a risk of infection. Most cases of HPV infection have no specific symptoms and patients can recover on their own after a few months without treatment.\nHowever, in cases of infection with high-risk types of HPV virus, this virus can exist for a long time in the body, causing genetic changes in cervical cells, leading to initial and long-term damage that gradually increases over time. leads to cancer.\nAlthough the progression to cancer in this location often has no clear symptoms, progresses slowly, lasting about 10-15 years, some countries have noted that this disease tends to rejuvenate, especially in young people. especially in countries where sexual intercourse occurs at an early age.\n\nClassification of cervical cancer\nDepending on the type of cervical cancer, patients are prescribed different treatment methods:\nSquamous cell carcinoma: A form of cancer that starts in the thin, flat cells lining the outer part of the cervix. According to statistics, this is the most common form of cervical cancer, about 80 - 85% of all cases, caused by infection with human papilloma virus (HPV).; Adenocarcinoma: A form of cancer that occurs in the glandular cells of the upper part of the cervix, accounting for about 10 - 20% of all cases.; Other forms of cervical cancer such as small cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, melanoma... are often unrelated. to the HPV papilloma virus, which is less common but cannot be prevented like squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nStages of cervical cancer\nNormally, the disease develops through stages: (4)\nStage 0: This stage has no cancer cells in the cervix, abnormal cells begin to appear and can develop into cancer cells in the future. Therefore, this stage is called precancerous or carcinoma in situ.; Stage I: Cancer has only occurred inside the cervix; Stage II: Cancer has begun to spread outside the cervix, invading surrounding tissues but not the tissues lining the pelvis or lower part of the vagina.; Stage III: Cancer cells have invaded the lower part of the vagina and the tissues lining the pelvis.; Stage IV: Cancer metastasizes to other organs in the body, such as intestines, bladder, lungs...\nSee more: 4 stages of cervical cancer that women need to understand in detail.\nStages of cervical tumors\n\nDangerous complications of cervical cancer\nIf not detected early and treated promptly, it can progress badly, leading to dangerous complications, threatening the patient's health and life. Dangerous complications such as:\nInfertility: Tumors invade and affect the cervix - where sperm and eggs meet. In some cases, to completely treat the disease and ensure the patient's life, it is necessary to remove the entire uterus and ovaries, which means that women lose their motherhood. In addition, oophorectomy can cause menopause to occur sooner.; Psychophysical effects: The disease causes emotional disorders, in many cases patients suffer from depression, and family happiness is broken; Abnormal bleeding: In case the tumor invades the vagina, or metastasizes to the intestines or bladder, it can cause bleeding and the patient may urinate mixed with blood.; Kidney failure: Some studies show that tumors can squeeze into the ureters, blocking the flow of urine out of the kidneys. When urine accumulates for a long time, it will cause the kidneys to swell, causing kidney scarring and impaired kidney function.\nCervical cancer can lead to infertility, affecting family happiness\n“If cervical malignant tumor is detected early, right from the pre-cancerous stage, the cure rate can be up to more than 90%. In stage I, the successful treatment rate is about 85-90% and gradually decreases in later stages. In stage II, it reduces to 50-75%, in stage III it is 25-40% and in stage IV it is only 15%, the patient's prognosis is only prolonged for 5 years\", MSc. Dinh Thi Hien Le emphasize.\n\nWho is at high risk of cervical cancer?\nMany studies have shown that a number of factors increase the risk of cervical tumors in women, including:\nHaving many sexual partners: The greater the number of sexual partners, especially if each sexual partner has many other sexual partners, the higher the chance of getting cancer caused by HPV in women.; Having sex early: Starting sex at an earlier age increases the risk of disease.; Pregnancy too early or multiple pregnancies: Pregnancy and childbirth at a young age - the genital organs are not fully developed (before age 17) increases the risk of damage to the reproductive organs, especially the genitals. Cervical. Some studies also show that women with multiple pregnancies (≥ 4 times) have a higher risk of getting the disease.; Having other sexually transmitted diseases: Other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, syphilis, HIV/AIDS... increase the risk of infection with HPV virus - the main cause of cervical cancer. uterus.; Weakened immune system: The immune system plays an important role in destroying cancer cells, so if the immune system is weakened, it will increase the risk of HPV infection.; Smoking: Cigarettes contain nicotine - a substance that weakens the immune system, causing an imbalance in cancer-causing genes.\nHaving sex early or having unsafe sex increases the risk of this disease\n\nDiagnosis of cervical tumors\nThrough clinical examination and medical history, if the doctor suspects that the patient is at risk of cervical cancer, he or she may prescribe some necessary tests. (5)\n1. Colposcopy\nThis diagnostic method is used in cases where the patient has abnormal cervical screening test results, or has one of the symptoms of cervical cancer. The purpose of this method is to detect abnormalities in the patient's cervix.\nThe doctor will use a speculum to open the vagina and use a small microscope with a light to observe the cervix. In case the patient has irregular bleeding, the doctor will order a chlamydia test before colposcopy.\n2. Cervical biopsy\nThe doctor may take a small tissue sample (biopsy) to test and detect cancer cells. This process can cause the patient to have prolonged vaginal bleeding, up to 6 weeks. Patients may also have pain symptoms similar to those during the menstrual cycle.\n“In most cases, abnormalities that are only detected by a certain diagnostic method are not enough to conclude whether the patient has cancer in the cervical region or not. Normally, patients will be assigned to perform some additional gynecological tests\", MSc. Dinh Thi Hien Le added.\n3. Additional tests and diagnostic imaging\nWhen the results of a colposcopy or biopsy show abnormal cells, the patient is at risk of cervical cancer and still needs to perform some additional tests such as:\nPelvic examination: This method is performed after general anesthesia, the doctor will in turn check for cancer cells in the patient's organs such as the uterus, vagina, bladder and rectum.; Blood tests: To evaluate the condition and extent of damage to the patient's liver, kidneys and bone marrow.; Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This method is used in cases where you want to identify tumors, probe the level of invasion and metastasis of abnormal cells.; Chest X-ray: To check if cancer cells have metastasized to the lungs; PET-CT scan: This method is often combined with CT scan to determine whether the cancer has metastasized or not, and to explore the patient's ability to respond to treatment methods.\nFrom the results of paraclinical examination combined with clinical examination, the doctor will make an accurate diagnosis of what stage the cancer is in and recommend treatment methods to avoid dangerous complications.\n\nCervical cancer treatment methods\nM.D. Dinh Thi Hien Le shared, \"The treatment method for cervical tumors is often multi-modal, meaning it includes many different treatment regimens, rather than surgery for cancer as many patients are still using. myths. Depending on the stage of the disease, there will be different treatment regimens, which can be simple surgery, can be radiotherapy, or can be a combination of surgery - chemotherapy - radiotherapy. At Tam Anh General Hospital, doctors will advise and choose the most appropriate and best treatment regimen for each patient.\"\n1. Pre-cancer stage\nAt this stage, abnormal cells only appear in the tissue lining the cervix, and have not yet invaded deeply and metastasized to other organs in the body. Depending on the patient's age and desire to have children, there are different treatment methods such as cone removal, LEEP, and cervical amputation. In cases where the patient is older or the patient no longer wishes to have children, an ovary-preserving hysterectomy can be used.\n2. Phase I\nThis is the stage when cancer cells have begun to invade the main tissues of the cervix, the doctor will prescribe partial or total hysterectomy, or use radiation therapy. However, the disadvantage of this method is that it can leave scars in the cervix after surgery, affecting the meeting and fertilization of eggs and sperm.\nIf too much tissue is removed from the cervix, women are at risk of miscarriage during pregnancy.\nSee more: 5 ways to treat cervical cancer - Can the disease be cured?\nRemoving too much tissue from the cervix can cause miscarriage\n3. Phase II – III\nCancer cells have invaded deeply into the vagina and spread throughout the pelvic wall area, so the most effective treatment method is radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy, but the disadvantage is that function cannot be preserved. reproduction. In some cases, the doctor will prescribe surgery to remove the uterus and ovaries combined with this method.\nWith the desire to preserve ovarian function and preserve women's motherhood, at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Tam Anh General Hospital, patients can preserve reproductive function by storing their ovaries first. during radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\n4. Stage IV\nIn stage IV, cancer cells have spread and metastasized to other organs in the body such as the rectum, bladder, even the liver, lungs, etc. Treatment at this stage is quite complicated and It costs a lot of money, but mainly reduces symptoms and prolongs the patient's life.\n\nHow to prevent cervical cancer?\nVaccination against HPV virus is considered the simplest and most effective preventive measure to reduce the risk of disease in women. In Vietnam, the HPV vaccine has been licensed for use by the Ministry of Health since 2007, capable of preventing damage and infection caused by two high-risk HPV types, 16 and 18. In addition, the vaccine also helps prevent genital warts and other genital cancers such as vagina, penis, vulva, anus...\nRecommend that women build a healthy life and minimize the risk of HPV infection - the cause of cervical tumors:; Do not have sex early, especially during adolescence because the genitals are not fully developed and are still sensitive.; Practice safe sex. Do not have sex with multiple partners because of the high risk of HPV infection, especially when that partner has many other partners.; You should keep your private area clean during menstruation, after sex...; Immediately go to a specialized facility for timely examination and treatment when there are unusual symptoms.\nWomen should immediately go to a specialist facility for examination when they have unusual symptoms\n“If detected at an early stage, cancer in the cervical organ can be completely cured. Therefore, women should proactively have regular screening at specialized medical facilities for early detection and timely and effective treatment, avoiding dangerous complications and preserving the sacred role of motherhood. Lieng\", M.D. Dinh Thi Hien Le reminded.\n\nCervical cancer screening\nIf in the past, detecting cancer cells required many complicated processes, now, with the remarkable advancement of technology, disease screening has become easier. Cervical cancer screening methods being applied at Tam Anh General Hospital include:\n1. Pap smear cell test\nThis method is also known as a Pap test or cervical smear, collecting cell samples in the uterus and analyzing them to detect cervical cancer early. In addition, Pap smear also helps detect abnormalities in the structure and activity of uterine cells, early warning of future disease risks.\n2. Thinprep test\nThis method takes a small tissue sample from the cervix and puts it into a Thinprep vial (fixing liquid), transfers it to the laboratory and automatically processes it with a Thinprep machine. This is considered a new step forward compared to traditional methods, helping to improve the quality of collected cell samples, ensuring the accuracy of disease screening.\nTam Anh General Hospital laboratory is equipped with modern machinery and technology for highly accurate results\n3. Test for HPV virus\nAccording to WHO statistics, about 99.7% of cervical cancer cases have the presence of HPV virus, so HPV testing is included in the screening process by the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tam Anh General Hospital to help detect present pathology. This test helps detect viruses that cause disease and can lead to cervical cancer in the future, usually applied to women 30 years of age and older. It is recommended to combine it with a Pap smear to get the most accurate overall results.\nCervical cancer screening and treatment at Tam Anh General Hospital Modern machinery system at Tam Anh General Hospital helps screen for diseases early and provide effective treatment Invested in a spacious and well-equipped infrastructure system With an advanced machinery system, imported synchronously from European countries, the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Tam Anh General Hospital carries out cancer screening tests with international quality standards right at the hospital. quickly and at a reasonable cost. In addition, Tam Anh General Hospital gathers a team of leading professors and doctors in the country in the field of Obstetrics and Gynecology, conducting the most accurate examinations, diagnoses, and advising on appropriate and effective treatment. most effective for each patient. For advice and to schedule an examination at Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact: Hotline 024 3872 3872 or Tam Anh General Hospital Fanpage Or come directly: 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep Street, Bo De Ward , Long Bien District, Hanoi City\n\nFrequently asked questions\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has issued alarming information, advising women to prevent the dangerous disease of cervical cancer and shows signs of getting younger. In 2019, for the first time, Vietnam recorded the case of a patient with a cervical tumor when she was only 14 years old. Or recently, two Vbiz female stars H.W and N.D.L.N shared in a talk show that they had struggled with this evil disease. (6)\nThis information has caused hundreds of confused and worried women to send questions to Tam Anh General Hospital. Summarizing some of the most sent questions, MSc. Dinh Thi Hien Le, Senior Doctor of Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, Tam Anh General Hospital answers as follows:\nCan cervical cancer be cured?\nCervical cancer can be cured, if detected early. In fact, with the development of world medicine and the support of the most advanced equipment and machinery system, the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Tam Anh General Hospital is mastering and successfully treating thousands of patients. Hundreds of cases related to the cervix. In particular, in cases of early detection right from the pre-cancer stage, with timely and proper intervention, the cure rate can be up to over 90%, while preserving reproductive function. product.\nHow long can cervical cancer last?\nCervical cancer progresses silently, lasting through many stages that take about 10 - 20 years. In some cases, cervical cancer patients were diagnosed with the disease when they were 40 years old, but the HPV virus germs had existed silently inside the body since adolescence. Therefore, early detection will contribute to increasing the possibility of curing the disease.\nIf the disease is detected in the pre-cancerous stage, the patient's fertility and life are preserved. However, in cases where the disease has progressed to an advanced stage, how long the patient can live will depend on the specific stage and treatment process. Usually:\nStage I: At this stage, cancer cells have invaded the main tissue of the cervix and have not yet localized to other organs. Therefore, an effective treatment method is partial or total hysterectomy or radiotherapy. The 5-year survival rate is up to about 90%, but it can affect pregnancy and increase the risk. threatened miscarriage due to the formation of scar tissue; Stage II: Cancer cells have begun to spread to the vagina and tissues around the cervix, so surgery and radiotherapy are needed. The survival rate after 5 years is 50 - 65%.; Stage III: The 5-year survival rate at this stage is only about 25 - 35%.; Stage IV: The tumor has spread to the pelvis, invaded organs such as the bladder, rectum, metastasized to the lungs, liver, bones... Treatment at this stage is very difficult, mainly prolonged. life time for the patient. The 5-year survival rate is less than 15%.\nCan I have children with cervical tumor?\nCervical tumors have different signs and symptoms through each stage. Depending on the level of disease progression, invasion and metastasis of cancer cells, there will be different treatment regimens such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy or surgery to remove part or all of the uterus and ovaries. egg. Therefore, the ability of women with cervical cancer to become pregnant and give birth will depend on the treatment method. However, if the disease is detected at an early stage, doctors can consider a treatment regimen to preserve the patient's reproductive function.\nAt the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Tam Anh General Hospital, doctors will advise and apply the most appropriate and effective regimens for each patient. In cases where the uterus and ovaries must be removed, to ensure the function and motherhood of women, the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Tam Anh General Hospital has implemented the service of storing ovaries before performing radiotherapy. , Valence.\nWhen should cervical tumor screening be performed?\nCervical cancer has no clear symptoms and progresses silently, making it difficult to detect and intervene promptly. Therefore, screening for cervical cancer is important, helping to detect risks early and provide timely and proper treatment right from the onset stage. The best time to perform screening will be different for each person depending on health, living environment and lifestyle... but in general, it is recommended that women 21 years of age and older should undergo screening. periodically according to the requirements of each method as well as the doctor's instructions.\nHow much does cervical tumor screening cost at Tam Anh General Hospital?\nDepending on the condition and symptoms of suspected cervical tumors, the doctor will recommend that women undergo additional paraclinical examinations. However, you should be aware that the cost of this screening will not be too high compared to the great health benefits it brings.\nCervical cancer can cause dangerous complications, threatening the patient's health and life if not detected early and intervened promptly. Women should proactively screen and vaccinate against HPV virus to protect themselves!",
