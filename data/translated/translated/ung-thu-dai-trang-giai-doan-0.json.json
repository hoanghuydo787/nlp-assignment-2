    "content": "Colon cancer stage 0: Don't be subjective in the pre-disease stage\n\nStage 0 colon cancer has the best prognosis, can be cured or has a high successful treatment rate, and is less expensive than other stages.\n\nWhat is stage 0 colon cancer?\nStage 0 colon cancer is very early stage cancer. Cancer cells are found only in the inner lining of the colon or rectum wall (new tumor cells develop in the mucosa layer that has not invaded the basement membrane). It is also known as carcinoma in situ or intramucosal carcinoma (Tis). (first)\nCancer cells can develop from the colorectal lining, on polyps or adenomas. Tumors at this stage have not broken through a protective membrane called the basement membrane, so there is no lymph node metastasis or distant metastases to other organs in the body, so the treatment is extremely effective, with a cure rate. up to nearly 100%.\nStage 0 colon cancer can be cured, treated highly effectively, and is less expensive than late stages.\n\nDecoding TNM staging in stage 0 colon cancer\nColon cancer is classified using a system called TNM, which is based on three factors: (2)\nSize of the primary tumor (T) and degree of invasion into the colorectal wall or adjacent organs; Whether the cancer has metastasized to regional lymph nodes (N).; Whether the cancer has metastasized (M) to distant organs: One or more organs or peritoneal spread.\nThus, stage 0 colon cancer is cancer in situ, in the mucosa layer that has not yet developed, broken the basement membrane or invaded other layers of the colon, and is classified as TisN0M0.\nSee more:\nColon cancer stage 1; Colon cancer stage 2; Stage 3 colon cancer; Stage 4 colon cancer\n\nDoes stage 0 colon cancer have symptoms?\nAccording to Dr. Vu Huu Khiem - Head of Oncology Department, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, stage 0 colon cancer usually does not have any signs or symptoms. That's why cancer screening is so important, especially for people with high risk factors.\nCancer screening is a test to detect abnormal cells early before symptoms appear. If you wait until you have symptoms to go to the hospital for tests, this is not considered screening.\nColon cancer screening is recommended in the following subjects:\nPeople aged 45 and over.; People in good health and with a life expectancy of over 10 years should continue to be screened for colon cancer periodically until age 75.; For people 76 – 85 years old, the decision to get screened should be based on life expectancy, overall health, and previous screening history. of a person.; People over 85 should no longer be screened for colon cancer.\n\nWho is at high risk of colon cancer?\nThe following people have higher risk factors for colon cancer than the general population:\nPersonal history of chronic colon disease (bleeding ulcerative colitis, colon polyps or Crohn's disease).; Family history has a complex cancer pattern: Many people have cancer, have cancer at a young age, or one member has many types of cancer at the same time.; Confirmed or suspected hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer – abbreviated HNPCC).; Personal history of radiation to the abdomen (abdomen) or pelvic area.; Unscientific diet, overweight, obesity, lack of exercise,...\n\nDiagnosis of stage 0 colon cancer\nIn addition to a physical examination, personal and family medical history, and symptoms, the doctor may prescribe the following paraclinical tests to help diagnose colon cancer. (3)\ncolonoscopy\nThis is the most commonly used and effective functional exploration tool in diagnosing colon cancer. This method allows doctors to determine the location, quantity, morphology, and size of the tumor and take a part of the tumor for histological examination. Tam Anh General Hospital is equipped with a Fuji 7000 endoscopy system (Japan) with an endoscope equipped with the latest imaging technology, capable of magnifying up to 140 times to help observe all lesions in the digestive tract. , including small lesions in the early stages. By acquiring images of the entire colon, the tumor detection rate with sensitivity and specificity is up to 92-97%.\nScreening colonoscopy helps detect colon cancer early and treat it effectively.\nBlood tests\nSerum CEA antigen levels are elevated in 70% of colon cancer patients, but this test is not specific and is therefore not recommended for screening the disease. However, if CEA levels are high before surgery and low after colon tumor resection, monitoring these levels may help detect recurrence earlier. In addition, the tumor marker CA 19-9 is also used in colorectal cancer. The value of tumor markers helps treating doctors evaluate results, monitor recurrence and predict disease prognosis.\nGenetic analysis\nColon tumors removed during surgery are analyzed for associated genetic mutations. Patients with a family history of colorectal, ovarian, and endometrial cancers, especially at a young age, should be tested to rule out Lynch syndrome. Tests to determine gene mutations such as KRAS, NRAS, BRAF are also routinely prescribed to provide the best treatment regimen as well as disease prognosis.\nDiagnostic imaging includes: CT scan, MRI, PET/CT\nCT and MRI scans help evaluate disease stage, tumor status, invasion level, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis to other organs in the body; From there, doctors will recommend the most suitable treatment method.\nPET/CT is one of the accurate staging tools, especially identifying lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis.\nTest to find hidden blood in stool\nThis is a simple, inexpensive and non-invasive diagnostic test. Testing showing hemoglobin in the stool would indicate bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract. However, blood in the stool is a non-specific indicator of colon cancer because it can originate from non-cancerous changes such as polyps larger than 1-2 cm, ulcerative colitis. , stomach ulcers,…\nPatients with a positive fecal occult blood test should undergo colorectal, esophageal-stomach-duodenal endoscopy. If there is a lesion seen during examination, excision or biopsy for pathology is extremely necessary. If the lesion is sessile or cannot be completely removed through colonoscopy, doctors will consider surgery.\nFIT test\nFecal occult blood immunoassay (FIT): The test uses a specific protein that acts as an antibody to find and bind to hemoglobin in stool. This test is often used in colorectal cancer screening.\nSee more: 5 stages of colon cancer: How to evaluate and diagnose in detail.\n\nHow to treat stage 0 colon cancer?\nBecause stage 0 colon cancer has not grown beyond the colon lining, surgery is often the only treatment. (4)\nIn most cases, surgery can be performed by removing the polyp or performing a colonoscopic resection (local excision).\nSimple polypectomy (as above) or endoscopic mucosal resection (Mucosectomy) if sm1/2, G1,2; or wedge resection to enlarge the lesion; Cut the connecting colon immediately if the lesion is widely removed and it is not certain that the entire lesion has been removed or the resection area is (+).\nCommon side effects of surgery are pain and discomfort in the surgical area, which can cause digestive disorders, but usually go away after a while. Patients need to adjust their diet and exercise their bowel function after surgery.\nDuring the initial period after surgery, patients need to limit fiber intake because it will make diarrhea more severe. After surgery is stable, patients can increase the amount of fiber in their diet again.\nIn addition, when suffering from colon cancer, patients need to avoid eating fermented foods such as melons, eggplants, shrimp, and sour fish; Limit salty foods; Do not drink soft drinks, beer, wine, etc.\nAfter surgery, patients need to continue regular examinations and tests to manage cancer and prevent the risk of recurrence.\nAfter surgical resection of colorectal cancer, screening colonoscopy should be performed within 1 year after surgery. The second screening colonoscopy should be performed every 3 years.\nMonitoring and early detection of disease recurrence includes history taking, clinical examination and assessment of serum CEA levels every 3-6 months for the first 2 years and then every 6 months for the next 3-5 years. . Imaging studies (CT or MRI) are usually recommended once a year, especially in cases of abnormalities on physical examination or blood tests.\nRegular health checks and proactive cancer screening when risk factors are present are the best ways to prevent colon cancer.\nStage 0 colon cancer is considered the local stage of cancer, with the highest cure rate. At this stage, the disease often does not have any warning symptoms, so the only way to detect the disease early is regular screening. Doctor Khiem recommends performing health checks twice a year and screening for colon cancer from age 45 and older. You can especially start screening for the disease at a younger age for high-risk groups.",
