    "content": "Stage 1 colon cancer: Signs, diagnosis and treatment\n\nStage 1 colon cancer belongs to early stage colon cancer. At this time, the prognosis is very good, the disease can be cured or the survival rate after 5 years is high.\n\nWhat is stage 1 colon cancer?\nStage 1 colon cancer is cancer that has grown through the submucosa, muscle lining of the colon or into the muscle wall but has not grown further. There is no cancer in the lymph nodes.\n\nTNM stage in stage 1 colon cancer\nThe staging system for colorectal cancer is the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system.\nTNM is based on 3 main pieces of information as follows:\nExtent (size) of the tumor (T)\nHas the cancer grown to invade the colon or rectum?\nThe wall of the colon or rectum consists of layers from inside to outside as follows:\nMucosa: Nearly all colorectal cancers start in the mucosa, including the mucosa; Submucosa: Is fibrous tissue below the mucosa; Thick muscle layer: Is the musculature of the colorectal.; Serosa: Thin, outer layers of connective tissue that cover most of the colon but not the rectum.\nSpread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes (N)\nThe letter N (Node) shows whether the colon cancer has metastasized to nearby lymph nodes or not?\nSpread (metastasis) of cancer to distant sites (M)\nHas the colon cancer metastasized to distant lymph nodes or distant organs such as the liver, brain or lungs?\nAccording to TNM staging, stage 1 colon cancer (T1 or T2, N0, M0) has the following characteristics.\nThe cancer has grown through the muscle lining into the submucosa (T1) and it may also have grown into the muscle layer (T2).; Cancer has not spread to nearby lymph nodes (N0) and has not spread to distant locations (M0).\nSee more:\nColon cancer stage 0; Colon cancer stage 2; Stage 3 colon cancer; Stage 4 colon cancer\nStage 1 colon cancer in the early stages often has a good prognosis and more effective treatment than later stages.\n\nSigns of stage 1 colon cancer\nColorectal cancer may not cause symptoms right away. In fact, many symptoms of colorectal cancer can also be caused by other problems, such as infection, hemorrhoids, irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease. It is important for patients to check periodically or check immediately if they experience any digestive problems such as: abdominal pain, mucous stools mixed with blood.\nStage 1 colon cancer symptoms are often asymptomatic or have unclear, vague symptoms. If so, it may include:\nChanges in bowel habits, such as diarrhea or constipation lasting more than a few days.; Flat feces shaped like rice leaves; Feeling of incomplete defecation; Rectal bleeding with bright red blood or bloody mucus; Black stool due to gastrointestinal bleeding; Abdominal cramps or pain; Weakness and fatigue; Unintended weight loss can also be a symptom of stage 1 colon cancer.\nDr. Trung said that stage 1 colon cancer symptoms are often unclear, only when the cancer spreads do the above recognizable symptoms appear. That's why it's best for us to have regular check-ups to screen and detect colorectal cancer early before there are any symptoms. Colorectal cancer detected early through screening, before symptoms appear, can be treated more easily and effectively. Screening also helps detect and treat pre-cancerous tumors such as polyps to prevent some gastrointestinal cancers, including colorectal cancer.\n\nHow to diagnose stage 1 colon cancer\nIf there are symptoms that suggest a person may have colon cancer, the doctor will review the patient's medical history and perform a physical exam. The doctor may also ask the patient to do laboratory diagnostic methods.\nParaclinical methods for diagnosing colon cancer include:\nColonoscopy and biopsy\nIf the doctor suspects signs of colorectal cancer, the patient will have an endoscopy and a biopsy sample taken to check. In this method, the doctor will remove a small piece of tissue with a special instrument. Then, pathology of that tissue sample is performed to determine whether there areÂ  abnormal cells or not. (first)\nCT and MRI\nDoctors may recommend CT and MRI scans to determine the stage of the cancer and see if the disease has spread to other organs.\nEndoscopic ultrasound\nThe doctor prescribes endoscopic ultrasound (Endoscopy combined with ultrasound in the colorectal lumen) to assess the level of invasion of the tumor (T), thereby assessing whether the disease is stage 1 or not.\nGenetic testing\nColon cancer may be related to certain genetic mutations that cause normal cells to become cancerous. These changes in genes are called somatic mutations. They are found only in cancer cells and not in normal cells, so they cannot be passed on to offspring.\nFor some advanced cancers, doctors will do molecular testing on a tumor to look for Somatic mutations. These mutations can predict how tumors respond to treatments. Understanding the genetic makeup of the tumor will help doctors choose more effective treatment methods.\nIf the cancer has spread beyond the colorectal, the doctor will test the biopsy sample to find common gene mutations in colon cancer such as EGFR, KRAS; NRAS; BRAF; MSI; HER 2- Neu. In addition, your doctor will also test for mutations in less common genes.\nPainless colonoscopy helps screen for early-stage colon cancer at Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City\n\nTreatment of stage 1 colon cancer\nStage 1 colon cancers have grown deeper into the layers of the colon wall, but they have not spread outside the colon wall or invaded nearby lymph nodes.\nStage 1 cancer includes part of a polyp or in situ cancers. If the polyp is completely removed during a colonoscopy and there are no cancer cells at the edges (margins) of the piece removed, additional treatment may not be needed. (2)\nIf the cancer in the polyp is high-risk or there are cancer cells at the edges of the polyp, surgery may be more likely to be recommended. You may also be advised to have further surgery if the polyp cannot be completely removed or if many pieces have to be removed, making it difficult to identify cancerous cells.\nFor cancers that are not polyps or where the degree of invasion is difficult to assess, surgical removal of part of the cancerous colon and dissection of nearby lymph nodes (regional lymph nodes) is the standard treatment. . In this case, the patient will usually no longer need adjuvant treatment.\n\nPrognosis of 5-year survival for stage 1 colon cancer\nAccording to data from the American Cancer Society, the overall 5-year survival rate of colon cancer is 67%. However, this rate can change based on a number of factors such as the patient's health at the time of diagnosis, ability to respond to treatments, age,... especially the stage of cancer. Colon.\nIf colon cancer is diagnosed in the localized stage, the 5-year survival rate is 90%. The 5-year survival rate is 17% if colon cancer has spread to surrounding tissues or organs and/or regional lymph nodes. In cases where cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, the 5-year survival rate is 17%. (3)\nStage 1 colon cancer is localized, so the 5-year survival rate is 90%. Thus, the prognosis of stage 1 colon cancer is very good, with a high chance of cure. Therefore, screening and detecting the disease at an early stage helps treat it effectively and improve the quality of life for patients.\n\nFrequently asked questions about stage 1 colon cancer\nIs stage 1 colon cancer dangerous?\nAccording to Dr. Trung, cancer is definitely dangerous. However, with early-stage cancer, the danger will be less than with late-stage cancer. Stage 1 colon cancer is early stage colon cancer, so the chance of cure or survival rate after 5 years is very high (more than 90%). Therefore, patients need to be screened and detected early for timely treatment with individualized regimens, without delay as the disease progresses more complicatedly and the prognosis becomes poorer.\nCan stage 1 colon cancer be cured?\nStage 1 colon cancer is curable. Because at this stage, cancer cells are only localized in the colon and have not affected other parts of the body, it can be cured by complete surgical removal.\nCan stage 1 colon cancer come back?\nMost people with stage 1 colon cancer respond well to treatment. In fact, about 90% of people treated for stage 1 colon cancer live at least 5 years after the cancer is detected.\nThat said, colon cancer can come back, which is called recurrence. But the risk of recurrence of stage 1 colon cancer is lower than other stages.\nAfter treatment, patients need to continue to periodically monitor with the doctor and perform paraclinical examinations as prescribed; At the same time, change a healthy lifestyle.\nYou should not wait until you have symptoms to go to the hospital for examination, because rectal cancer and other gastrointestinal cancers in general often progress silently.\nRisk factors for colon cancer include smoking, drinking alcohol, personal and family history of polyps or colorectal cancer, overweight/obesity, a diet high in red meat and processed foods, vitamin D deficiency, age 50 and older, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), African American, Eastern European Jew, type 2 diabetes, shift worker night, had previously treated other types of cancer.\nTo schedule an examination and screening for colorectal cancer at Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nColon cancer is often detected after symptoms appear. But most people with early-stage colon cancer, including stage 1 colon cancer, have virtually no symptoms. Most diseases are discovered when they have progressed severely. Therefore, you should not wait until you have symptoms to go to the hospital for examination, because rectal cancer and other digestive cancers in general often progress silently. Both men and women should practice the habit of regular health check-ups every 6 months to detect health abnormalities early. For people with risk factors, starting at age 45 should be screened for colon cancer at least once, then continue screening as recommended by a specialist.",
