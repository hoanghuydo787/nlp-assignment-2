    "content": "Penile cancer: Causes, signs, diagnosis and prevention\n\nPenile cancer can occur in all men, but people with the disease often fall in their 60s. Abnormal symptoms occur in the skin of the penis, scrotum, and foreskin (if uncircumcised); If accompanied by lymphadenopathy, men need to go to the Department of Andrology and Urology as soon as possible.\n\nWhat is penile cancer?\nPenile cancer occurs when cells grow out of control outside or in a man's penis. The disease often starts from skin cells, but \"seeds\" can also appear inside the penis. (first)\nPenile cancer is rare, but if detected early, it can be completely treated.\nPenile cancer is divided into the following types:\n1. Squamous cell carcinoma\nSquamous cell carcinoma accounts for 95% of penile cancer cases. The disease often appears in the outermost layer of skin, so it is called carcinoma. However, the disease can also progress in other parts of the penis.\n2. Basal cell carcinoma\nIn contrast to squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma occurs in the final layer of the epithelium. The characteristic of this form of cancer is that it grows slowly and is unable to spread to other areas of the body.\n3. Melanoma\nIt is a form of cancer that begins in the cells that give skin its color, also called melanocytes.\n4. Sarcoma\nSarcoma is a term used to describe cancers that start in bones and soft tissues. For penile cancer, signs form in tissues such as blood vessels, muscle and fat.\n\nRisk factors and causes of penile cancer\nTo date, the main cause of penile cancer is still unclear. However, scientists have found that men with the following factors have a higher risk of getting the disease. They include: (2)\nHuman papilloma virus (HPV) present (3); Over age 60; Smoke; Have a weakened immune system due to HIV/AIDS (4); Without circumcision, fluid and other substances can accumulate under the foreskin, increasing the likelihood of developing cancer; Men with phimosis cause this part to become tight and difficult to clean, leading to the accumulation of fluid and residue; Treated psoriasis with psoralen and ultraviolet (UV) light\n\nSigns of penile cancer\nChanges in the skin of the penis are the most common symptom of penile cancer. Signs may appear on the foreskin (uncircumcised men), on the head of the penis or on the shaft of the penis.\nSymptoms of penile cancer include:\nChange in penile skin thickness or color; Rash or small scaly bumps on the penis; Lumps on the penis; Foul-smelling discharge under the foreskin; Feeling pain, possibly bleeding during erection or during sex; Swelling of the penis; Lumps under the skin in the groin area\nHowever, these symptoms are not always considered a warning of penile cancer. Infectious problems or allergic reactions can also cause the above symptoms. Therefore, it is necessary to see a specialist in Andrology - Urology so that the doctor can review and give appropriate treatment.\n\nSymptoms of penile cancer by stage\nPenile cancer is divided into 4 stages, according to test results. Each stage has different manifestations. Specifically:\nStage 0: Initially only appears on the top layer of the skin with mild changes in skin color in the private area; sharp pain/dull pain in the penis (more painful when erect or touched); small cauliflower-shaped ulcers; pain, burning sensation; The discharge has a foul odor. At this stage, penile cancer can spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body.; Stage 1: On the outside, the ulcers have increased in size and deepened. Skin shows signs of necrosis; secrete mucus, cloudy, foul smell. At this time, the cancer has spread to the connective tissue under the skin, possibly spreading to glands, lymph nodes or other parts of the body.; Stage 2: In addition to the same symptoms as stage 1, entering this stage, cancer cells may have spread to the erectile tissues or urethra; other parts of the body.; Stage 3: Cancer has spread to the connective tissue under the skin, lymph vessels, and blood vessels. Cancer cells may even have spread to the erectile tissues, urethra, lymph nodes in the groin (hard enlarged inguinal lymph nodes) and other parts of the body.; Stage 4 (final stage): The patient now loses weight, is exhausted, loses appetite, vomits blood... Cancer cells have also spread to areas near the penis such as the pubic bone, scrotum under the penis, even spread to other areas and organs of the body.\n\nIs penile cancer dangerous?\nPenile cancer is dangerous but can be treated. If stage 0 or 1 penile cancer is detected, still limited to the penis, from the time of diagnosis, the 5-year survival rate is about 85% after surgery. In stages 3 and 4, the 5-year survival rate is about 59%. If cancer metastasizes to distant parts of the body, the 5-year survival rate is 11%.\nTherefore, depending on when cancer is detected, the earlier it is detected, the higher the chance of curing it and preserving the \"little guy\". If detected slowly, the patient's life time will be shortened.\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\nMen who see any signs of penile cancer (mentioned above) or have the following factors should also see a Andrologist regularly:\nHave ever had a penile injury, urinary tract infection or genital warts; Foreskin stenosis but not circumcised; Diagnosed with urethral stricture\n\nDiagnosis of penile cancer\nThe doctor will do a physical examination and ask about symptoms. If necessary, the doctor will prescribe the patient to perform tests such as:\nBiopsy: The doctor will take a small tissue sample from the damaged area on the skin of the penis to check for cancer cells.; Imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, ultrasounds, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look for tumors or other signs that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\n\nPenile cancer treatment\nIf the cancer is in its early stages, treatment may include:\nThe medicine is in the form of a skin cream; Cryotherapy, a procedure that uses extremely cold liquid or a device to freeze and destroy cancerous tissue; Mohs surgery removes affected skin layer by layer until healthy tissue is reached; Laser to cut and destroy cancerous areas; Circumcision surgery if cancer is only on the foreskin\n\nMeasures to prevent penile cancer\nAccording to the advice of Andrologists, men should follow the following precautions:\nMen over the age of 60 should regularly check themselves for changes in their private areas (especially the skin).; Regular health check-ups every 6 months at medical facilities specializing in andrology and oncology to screen for penile cancer when there are risk factors, etc. to detect early signs of cancer and timely intervention.; Maintain a healthy sex life, use condoms to avoid infection with HPV, HIV or other bacteria and viruses that cause balanitis; Do not smoke or abuse alcohol; Daily exercise; Healthy eating; Avoid stress and exposure to toxic chemicals\nIn addition, circumcision right from birth has been proven and recognized as a measure that can effectively help prevent penile cancer for men.\nCenter for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology - Urology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts, Internal Medicine and Surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
