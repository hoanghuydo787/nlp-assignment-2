Clinical examination and chest X-ray are the first measures usually taken. After that, the doctor may do additional tests and imaging to confirm the diagnosis of cancer. Among them, the most popular means in Vietnam to evaluate lung cancer is computed tomography (CT scan).\nCurrently, the dual-balloon CT computed tomography system that produces 768 slices at Tam Anh General Hospital is considered one of the most modern systems because of its outstanding advantages such as:\nAbility to detect small lung nodules only 2 - 3 millimeters in size; Comprehensive assessment of tumor growth in all directions.; Safe for patients thanks to the Tin filter - minimizing the maximum dose of X-rays used.\nScreening for stage III non-small cell lung cancer using a 768-slice dual-balloon CT scan system at Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City\nIn addition to a CT scan, the doctor may recommend that the patient have a brain MRI to investigate brain metastases. In some cases, patients may need to have PET-CT or bone scan (Bone scan) performed to accurately assess the stage of the disease.\nTo diagnose lung cancer, currently the \"gold standard\" is the biopsy results from the tumor or lymph node (pathology). After detecting lung or lymph node damage on imaging diagnostic tools, depending on the location of the tumor or lymph node, the doctor may recommend that the patient perform one of the following biopsy methods: needle biopsy. under the guidance of CT, or bronchoscopy (can be combined with ultrasound through bronchoscopy), or surgical biopsy (in addition to the purpose of biopsy, it also helps to evaluate the stage).\nIn addition to determining the diagnosis of lung cancer from biopsy results; Patients will need to perform blood tests, respiratory function assessment tests... to comprehensively assess physical condition and accompanying diseases. From there, the doctor can recommend the most appropriate treatment.\nIn some cases, doctors may recommend that patients perform gene mutation tests using biopsied tissue samples, to consider using supportive medications after surgery with immunotherapy or targeted therapy. .\n\nTreatment of stage III non-small cell lung cancer\nCurrently, cancer treatment guidelines from the Ministry of Health and cancer associations around the world emphasize the role of combining many treatment methods (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy...), in order to Optimize treatment effectiveness.\nThe combination of multiple treatment methods (also called multimodality treatment) is clearly shown in the treatment of stage III non-small cell lung cancer; helps increase disease control, reduce the risk of relapse after treatment and improve patient survival. (5)\nStage IIIA\nAccording to Dr. Vu Tran Minh Nguyen, treatment of stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer may include the following situations:\nSurgery first, followed by supportive treatment to destroy remaining tumor cells, helps reduce the risk of recurrence. Supportive treatment methods include radiotherapy, chemotherapy, concurrent chemo-radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy. The choice of supportive treatment will depend on the post-operative pathology results and each patient's individual condition (physical condition, comorbidities...).; Chemistry and radiation are completely simultaneous. This is a method that combines chemotherapy and radiotherapy at the same time, used in cases of stage IIIA lung cancer that cannot be operated on. Patients after radical concurrent chemotherapy and radiation can be treated with immunotherapy (Durvalumab – Imfinzi) to improve survival rate.; Concurrent chemotherapy and radiation before surgery. This method is often applied in cases where the tumor is at the top of the lung. After concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the patient will be evaluated for surgery. At this time there will be 2 situations:\nIf the condition is currently operable, the patient will undergo surgery. Then, depending on the results after surgery, the doctor will recommend appropriate supportive treatment methods. If the condition still cannot be operated on, the patient will continue to receive chemotherapy.; If the condition is currently operable, the patient will undergo surgery. Then, depending on the results after surgery, the doctor will recommend appropriate supportive treatment methods.; If the condition still cannot be operated on, the patient will continue to receive chemotherapy.; Prior chemotherapy (also called neoadjuvant chemotherapy), can be combined with immunotherapy (Nivolumab – Opdivo). After the neoadjuvant treatment phase, depending on treatment response, the patient may receive surgery or concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\nStage IIIB, IIIC\nFor stage IIIB cancer onwards, Dr. Vu Tran Minh Nguyen said that radical treatment with surgery is almost impossible because the disease has progressed too far. During this period, concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the main treatment method, followed by consolidation treatment with immunotherapy with Durvalumab.\nIn some cases, patients cannot receive chemotherapy and radiation at the same time due to the metastasis of cancer, accompanying diseases... the patient can receive radiation therapy or chemotherapy alone.\n\nAdvances in the treatment of stage III lung cancer\nImmunotherapy\nAccording to Dr. Vu Tran Minh Nguyen, maintenance treatment with Atezolizumab (Tecentriq) or Pembrolizumab (Keytruda): can be prescribed after the patient has had surgery and supportive chemotherapy. The use of maintenance immunotherapy after adjuvant chemotherapy shows a clear improvement in patient survival time.\nConsolidation treatment with Durvalumab (Imfinzi): recommended after the patient has had concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy, also shows a clear improvement in the patient's survival time.\nTargeted therapy\nPreviously, targeted therapy was often used in cases of late-stage lung cancer with distant metastases. Currently, the use of Osimertinib (Tagrisso) for treatment after surgery or chemotherapy has shown to significantly improve survival time for patients with appropriate EGFR mutations.\nIn addition to the standard treatment methods mentioned above, the introduction of immunotherapy drugs (Cemiplimab, Tremelimumab,...) and new generation targeted drugs (Sotorasib, Adagrasib...) contributes to prolonging survival and improving survival time. quality of life for patients.\n\nLiving with stage III non-small cell lung cancer\nFamily companionship is an indispensable factor in the treatment of stage III non-small cell lung cancer\nStage III non-small cell lung cancer not only causes physical pain, but also mental pain, and treatments for stage III non-small cell lung cancer can also cause some side effects. side effects for patients. Therefore, patients need to note the following:\nProactively inform your doctor about the symptoms you experience to get advice and control symptoms in the best way.; Eat well to maintain health for the next treatment sessions.; Practicing deep breathing exercises and respiratory rehabilitation can also improve symptoms.; Quit smoking if you smoke.\nBesides, confiding regularly with family, or talking more with medical staff seems unimportant; but it's actually ineffective. By doing things that make you happy, the patient will perceive life more gently and love life. This will be the best support medicine for cancer treatment.\nTo schedule an examination, screening and treatment of lung cancer at the Oncology Department, Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nCurrently, medicine is making new advances in the treatment of stage III non-small cell lung cancer, helping to improve survival rates for patients. Therefore, patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer should follow their doctor's instructions and maintain a healthy lifestyle, avoiding negative thoughts to achieve the best treatment results.",
