    "content": "Testicular cancer: Signs, diagnosis and treatment\n\nTesticular cancer is a relatively rare disease that occurs in the testicles. The disease has a very high chance of successful treatment, even when the cancer has metastasized from the testicles. Depending on the type and stage of testicular cancer, patients will be prescribed different treatment methods.\n\nWhat is testicular cancer?\nTesticular cancer is a condition in which normal cells in the testicles change and grow out of control, leading to the formation of tumors. Testicles are part of the male reproductive system, located below the penis and in the scrotum.\nTesticular cancer is often divided into 3 stages:\nStage I: Tumor localized in the testicles.; Stage II: Cancer cells have spread to lymph nodes in the lower abdomen; Stage III: Cancer has spread to other areas of the body.\n\nCauses of testicular cancer\nThe cause of testicular cancer has not yet been found. Basically, testicular cancer occurs when healthy cells in the testicles mutate. Most testicular cancers start in germ cells. These are cells in the testicles that produce immature sperm. However, what causes germ cells to become abnormal and develop into cancer is still unanswered.\nThe following factors can increase the risk of testicular cancer in men:\nUndescended testicles: In the fetus, the testicles will be located in the abdominal cavity. Before a boy is born, this organ will gradually move through the inguinal canal to the scrotum. Undescended testicles appear when the testicles have problems descending from the abdomen to the scrotum. Because the temperature of the abdomen is higher than the temperature in the scrotum, the testicles located in the abdomen are susceptible to degeneration, causing infertility. This disorder increases the risk of testicular cancer. The risk remains increased even if the testicle has been surgically moved to the scrotum.; Abnormal testicles: There are a number of reasons why the testicles develop abnormally, potentially increasing the risk of testicular cancer.; Family history: When family members have had testicular cancer, men have a relatively high risk of developing the disease.; Age: Testicular cancer affects teenagers and young men, especially those aged 15 - 35. However, the disease can still appear at any age.\nRace: Men of any race are at risk of testicular cancer.\n\nSigns of testicular cancer\nPainless or swollen lump on either testicle. If detected early, the tumor is small in size. However, without timely intervention, the tumor can grow much larger.; Feeling of heaviness in the scrotum: For example, one testicle may become hard compared to the other testicle or testicular cancer will cause the testicle to grow larger or smaller.; Feeling of dull pain in the lower abdomen or groin; Accumulation of fluid in the scrotum; Soft or developed breasts: This is a rare condition. Some testicular tumors produce hormones that cause breast pain or breast tissue growth. This condition is called gynecomastia; Lower back pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, bloody phlegm can be signs of later stage testicular cancer.; Swelling of one or both legs, difficulty breathing due to blood clots.\n\nMethods of diagnosing testicular cancer\nTo determine whether a tumor in the testicle is cancerous or not, the doctor may prescribe the patient to undergo tests such as:\n1. Ultrasound\nTesticular ultrasound is a method that uses sound waves to create images of the scrotum and testicles. During the ultrasound, the patient will lie on their back and spread their legs wide. The doctor will apply specialized gel to the patient's scrotum to help make the ultrasound image clearer. A handheld probe is moved through the scrotum to create ultrasound images. An ultrasound will help your doctor determine the nature of the testicular tumor (whether the tumor is solid or filled with fluid). This imaging diagnosis also helps doctors determine whether the tumor is inside or outside the testicles.\n2. Blood test\nThe doctor may prescribe the patient a blood test to determine cancer markers in the patient's blood. Cancer markers are substances that are normally present in your blood. However, levels of these substances are likely to increase in certain diseases, including testicular cancer. High levels of cancer markers in the blood do not mean you have cancer. However, it can help doctors guide the diagnosis.\n3. Surgical removal of one testicle\nWhen it is certain that the tumor is cancerous, the doctor may prescribe surgery to remove the testicle. The removed testicles will be analyzed. Your doctor will determine whether the tumor is cancerous and, if so, what type of cancer it is.\n3.1 Determine the type of cancer\nThe testicles are removed or biopsied and will be analyzed to determine the type of testicular cancer. This determination will help the doctor provide appropriate treatment and prognosis. There are two types of testicular cancer:\nGerm cell tumor (Seminoma): This is a germ cell tumor of the testicles, a treatable malignant tumor. This tumor occurs at all ages. If an elderly person has testicular cancer, the risk of that person getting a seminoma is very high.; Non-germ cell tumor (Nonseminoma): Includes cancers that are not seminoma. Nonseminoma is often discovered in men at a young age. These tumors often develop in young men and spread very quickly. Some types of nonseminoma tumors such as embryonal carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, teratoma, and yolk sac tumor.\n3.2 Cancer stage\nOnce the doctor has accurately diagnosed the patient with cancer, the next step is to determine the stage of the cancer. To determine whether the cancer has spread outside the testicles or not, the patient may be prescribed a number of tests such as:\nComputed tomography (CT) to look for signs that the cancer has spread; Blood test: This test evaluates for elevated cancer markers.\n\nComplications of testicular cancer\nTesticular cancer is a disease with a very high chance of successful treatment. However, the disease can still spread to other parts of the body. If one or both testicles are removed, a man's fertility may be affected. Therefore, before starting treatment, you should talk to your doctor about appropriate interventions to preserve your fertility.\n\nTesticular cancer treatment methods\n1. Surgery\nSurgery is indicated in cases such as:\nOrchiectomy: This is the main treatment for most stages and types of testicular cancer.; Surgical removal of nearby lymph nodes: This treatment is performed through an incision in the abdomen. The doctor will be careful during surgical operations to avoid damaging the nerves surrounding the lymph nodes. However, some cases still cannot avoid nerve damage. Damaged nerves can cause difficulty in ejaculation, affecting the erection of the penis.\n2. Lymph node curettage\nIf orchiectomy surgery cannot completely remove cancer cells that have metastasized to lymph nodes, the patient needs to continue this surgery. The doctor may perform lymph node dissection at the same time or after orchiectomy if the cancer is later detected.\n3. Radiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a method that uses powerful beams of energy, such as X-rays, to destroy cancer cells. During radiotherapy, the patient will lie on a table. A large machine moves around the body to aim beams of energy at predetermined points on the patient's body. Radiation therapy can be performed alone or after the patient has had orchiectomy.\nSome side effects of radiotherapy that patients may experience include nausea, fatigue, skin redness and irritation in the abdomen and groin. This treatment also has the potential to reduce sperm count, affecting fertility in some men. Therefore, you should talk to your doctor about sperm preservation before radiotherapy.\n4. Chemotherapy\nThis is a treatment that uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs will travel throughout the patient's body to destroy cancer cells that have spread from the original tumor. Chemotherapy is often prescribed alone for treatment or may be prescribed before/after lymphadenectomy.\nSide effects of this treatment will depend on the specific medication the patient is taking. Common side effects are fatigue, hair loss, nausea, increased risk of infection... In addition, chemotherapy can also lead to infertility in some men. Some cases may be permanent. Therefore, if patients want to have children, they need to discuss carefully with their doctor about how to preserve sperm before chemotherapy.\n\nPreventing testicular cancer\nThere are currently no measures to prevent testicular cancer. It is advised that you should regularly check your testicles to promptly identify signs of testicular cancer at the earliest stage. This will help you easily recognize signs of abnormalities in the testicles.\nIn addition, men also need to ignore personal concerns when deciding to have their testicles examined. This will help your doctor accurately diagnose your condition.\nTo prevent the risk of testicular cancer, men need to equip themselves with disease prevention knowledge such as:\nFor young children, family members should check to see if the child has any birth defects, especially to observe whether the testicles are located in the abdomen or in another location.; Men of all ages, especially young men, should know how to examine their testicles. This will help you detect signs of abnormalities in the testicles early.; Testicular cancer patients who have been treated should plan for close monitoring to detect early signs of disease recurrence.\nMen of all ages, especially young men, should know how to examine their testicles\nThe Center for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts in internal medicine and surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
