Among them, stage 0 is the earliest stage.\nImage of the nasopharynx. Source: depositphotos.com\nStage 0 nasopharyngeal cancer has the following characteristics: (1)\nTumor (T: Tumor): The letter “T” plus a number (0 to 4) is used to evaluate the size of the tumor and the degree of invasion of structures around the tumor.; Tis: Carcinoma in situ.; Node (N: Node): The letter “N” in the TNM classification system is used to evaluate metastatic lymph nodes. Lymph nodes near the original tumor site are called regional lymph nodes. Lymph nodes outside the regional lymph node area are classified as distant metastases.\nFor people with nasopharyngeal cancer, doctors will check the lymph nodes in the neck on both sides, including the lymph nodes under the chin, under the jaw, behind the neck, behind the ear, along the sternocleidomastoid muscle and lymph nodes. on the blow.\nN0 (N zero): No regional lymph node metastasis; Metastasis (M): The letter “M” in the TNM system indicates whether there has been distant metastasis to other organs; M0 (M zero): Cancer has not spread to other parts of the body.\nThus, stage 0 is carcinoma in situ, has not spread to lymph nodes and has not spread to other parts of the body (Tis, N0, M0). (2)\nSee more: 5 stages of nasopharyngeal cancer: detailed assessment and diagnosis.\nStage 1 nasopharyngeal cancer; Stage 2 nasopharyngeal cancer; Stage 3 nasopharyngeal cancer; Stage 4 nasopharyngeal cancer\n\nDoes stage 0 nasopharyngeal cancer have symptoms?\nMSc. Nguyen Tien Sy, Department of Oncology, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, said that stage 0 nasopharyngeal cancer often has no symptoms. If present, the symptoms may be similar to common ear, nose and throat diseases, so the patient may subjectively ignore it and not go to the hospital for examination.\nSymptoms that may occur when the disease is in a more advanced stage include:\nHaving difficulty swallowing: Obstructed swallowing, painful swallowing, difficult swallowing.; Ear problems: Otitis media, ear pain, ringing in the ears or worse hearing, ear discharge.; Throat problems: Persistent sore throat that does not go away on its own, may be accompanied by a persistent cough.; Prolonged nasal discharge: Continuous nasal congestion, nosebleeds, unresponsive to conventional treatment.; Headache: Continuous, dull, diffuse pain that does not respond to regular painkillers.\nSigns of stage 0 nasopharyngeal cancer, if present, will often be similar to symptoms of common ear, nose and throat diseases.\nMost cases of stage 0 nasopharyngeal cancer are often discovered accidentally when examined for other diseases. Or detected during screening on high-risk subjects such as men, history of HPV, EBV virus infection, family members with nasopharyngeal cancer, habit of using a lot of alcohol, tobacco...\n\nIs stage 0 nasopharyngeal cancer dangerous?\nAccording to MSc. Nguyen Tien Sy, treatment of stage 0 nasopharyngeal cancer usually has good results, with a 5-year survival rate of over 82%.\nIn general, having cancer means being in a dangerous situation, so patients should not be negligent in treatment and re-examination to control cancer.\n\nHow to diagnose nasopharyngeal cancer\nCommonly used methods of screening and diagnosing nasopharyngeal cancer include:\nAsk for medical history\nThe doctor will ask about the patient's and family's history, including lifestyle issues, diet, and other factors that may increase the risk of developing nasopharyngeal cancer.\nExamination of the head and neck area\nThe doctor will feel for any suspicious cervical lymph nodes to detect abnormal locations.\nEar, nose and throat endoscopy\nIf a suspicious lesion is detected, the doctor may perform a biopsy to obtain a tissue sample. This tissue sample will be evaluated by pathologists to detect cancer cells.\nComputed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and neck\nThis method is indicated to evaluate local tumor characteristics and regional lymph node metastasis.\nPET-CT, or CT of other areas of the body\nThis technique can be used to evaluate whether the tumor has metastasized to other organs or not.\n\nHow to treat stage 0 nasopharyngeal cancer?\nMSc. Nguyen Tien Sy said that stage 0 nasopharyngeal cancer has a very high chance of being cured. Proactively going to the doctor when you see unusual signs, or proactively screening high-risk patient groups can help detect the disease at an early stage.\nDelaying treatment causes the disease to progress to more severe stages, with a poorer prognosis and increased treatment costs.\nRadiation therapy is a treatment for early-stage nasopharyngeal cancer. At this stage, although the cancer has not metastasized to nearby lymph nodes, these nodes often still need radiotherapy. Because these lymph nodes may have metastasized cancer cells but cannot be detected during examination nor can they be detected on CT/MRI images.\nWithout radiation therapy, cancer cells in the lymph nodes will continue to grow and may spread to other organs.\nDuring treatment, patients need to follow the specialist's instructions. At the end of treatment, patients need to comply with the follow-up appointment. Abandonment of treatment or combination with folk methods of unknown mechanism makes nasopharyngeal cancer progress more seriously.\n“Patients should not follow any diet without a doctor's prescription. Because improper dieting can cause nutritional deficiencies, making the body not strong enough to fight disease. Lack of nutrition can also make it impossible for the patient to follow the expected treatment regimen properly and fully\", M.D. Nguyen Tien Sy emphasized.\nYou need to eat a diverse, nutritious diet. You should not eat foods and drinks that are harmful to your health such as alcohol, cigarettes, soft drinks, and stimulants. It is necessary to avoid foods that can irritate the throat mucosa leading to swelling and coughing, such as foods that are too spicy, too hot, too greasy, etc.\nPatients should maintain daily work, regularly exercise and exercise at a moderate level; You can choose suitable activities such as walking, yoga, playing table tennis, swimming, cycling...\nAn issue that receives little attention, but has a very important impact on the treatment process, is that the patient should maintain an optimistic mental state and not be too stressed. You need to proactively talk and share with relatives, friends... to get help and more motivation to overcome the crisis period when you know you have a serious disease. Encouragement and support from relatives will help the patient have confidence in the treatment process.\nPatients with stage 0 nasopharyngeal cancer need to drink a variety of nutrients, not diet\nTo consult and schedule a nasopharyngeal cancer screening examination at Tam Anh General Hospital, you can contact:\nStage 0 nasopharyngeal cancer has a high cure rate, but the disease can still recur. Therefore, MSc. Nguyen Tien Sy recommends that continued monitoring after treatment is extremely necessary to prevent nasopharyngeal cancer from recurring.",
