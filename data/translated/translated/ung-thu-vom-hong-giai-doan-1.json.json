    "content": "Stage 1 nasopharyngeal cancer: Symptoms, diagnosis and treatment\n\nStage 1 nasopharyngeal cancer is often confused with other benign diseases such as flu, sore throat, or respiratory infections, so not treating it promptly causes the disease to progress. When the disease is detected at an early stage, the cure rate is high and survival time is increased. It is estimated that over 80% of patients are expected to live more than 5 years.\n\nWhat is stage 1 nasopharyngeal cancer?\nStage 1 nasopharyngeal cancer is a disease in which the tumor's growth is limited to the nasopharynx. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), each year there are about 133,000 new cases and more than 80,000 deaths due to nasopharyngeal cancer. Areas recording medium and high numbers of nasopharyngeal cancer cases include countries in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, with a rate of 25/100,000 people. In general, men are 2-3 times more likely to get nasopharyngeal cancer than women.\nThe rate of nasopharyngeal cancer in men is 2-3 times higher than in women.\nAccording to MSc Luu Thao Ngoc, Department of Oncology, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, the pathogenesis is believed to be related to the development of nasopharyngeal cancer including:\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection: EBV virus is a risk factor accounting for up to 90% of cases, and is the main etiological agent in the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal cancer.; HPV papilloma virus infection: This is the pathogenesis mentioned in post-EBV nasopharyngeal cancer, accounting for about 10% of cases due to infection with the Epstein-Barr virus.; Use of tobacco and alcohol: Excessive alcohol abuse and smoking can be the cause of nasopharyngeal cancer as well as stimulate EBV reactivation.; Genetic factors: If a first-degree relative has been diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer in the family, the risk of developing nasopharyngeal cancer will be 7 times higher than that of a person with no family history of the disease.; Improper nutrition: Diet low in fiber, abuse of silage and fermented foods (such as salted fish, salted meat, salted eggs, pickled sauerkraut...) with high nitrosamine content as well as other substances. mutagenic, direct genotoxic and EBV reactivating agents; Working in an unsafe environment: Employees often work in areas with a lot of toxic dust, wood dust, formaldehyde chemicals, radiation exposure...\n\nDecoding the T, N, M staging in stage 1 of nasopharyngeal cancer\nAccording to the TNM system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) used in evaluating the stage of nasopharyngeal cancer, the meaning of T, N, M classification in stage 1 nasopharyngeal cancer is understood. as follows: (1)\nT (Tumor) = tumor: Describes the size and invasiveness of the tumor.; N (Node) = node: Describes the state of cancer metastasis to regional lymph nodes.; M (Metastasis) = distant metastasis: Describes the state of cancer metastasis to other parts of the body.\nFor stage 1 nasopharyngeal cancer, the group of patients has a T1 primary tumor (tumor limited to the nasopharynx, can grow to the oropharynx or nasal cavity without invading the area around the oropharynx). , the disease has not metastasized to lymph nodes (N0) and no distant metastases were recorded (M0). (2)\nSee more: 5 stages of nasopharyngeal cancer: detailed assessment and diagnosis.\nStage 0 nasopharyngeal cancer; Stage 2 nasopharyngeal cancer; Stage 3 nasopharyngeal cancer; Stage 4 nasopharyngeal cancer\nImage of nasopharyngeal tumor location. Source: depositphotos.com\n\nSigns of stage 1 nasopharyngeal cancer\nMSc. Dr. Luu Thao Ngoc said that signs of stage 1 nasopharyngeal cancer are often seen in the Rosenmüller fossa area. The disease is often confused with symptoms of common respiratory diseases, even without symptoms or inaccurate diagnosis leading to patient subjectivity. As a result, the disease is only detected when nasopharyngeal cancer reaches an advanced stage and metastasizes, making treatment difficult as well as painful for the patient.\nSymptoms of stage 1 nasopharyngeal cancer are often non-specific or symptoms are often mild such as nasal symptoms (such as stuffy nose, nosebleed, nasal congestion, etc.), or symptoms in the oropharynx such as sore throat. ,... When not diagnosed early, the disease progresses, causing symptoms of advanced disease such as:\nHearing loss, tinnitus, feeling of fullness in the ears, serous otitis media occur infrequently;; Headache, double vision or blurred vision;; Facial numbness due to tumor affecting cranial nerve V;; Swollen lymph nodes in the neck, which may or may not be painful or swollen;; Sputum mixed with blood and pus.\n\nPrognosis of survival rate for stage 1 nasopharyngeal cancer\nMSc. Dr. Luu Thao Ngoc said that from clinical practice, a high percentage of stage 1 nasopharyngeal cancer cases have been cured after radical radiotherapy alone (over 90%), especially using Using advanced radiotherapy techniques such as dose-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has brought about good disease control, reduced acute and chronic treatment-related complications, and improved the quality of life for patients.\n\nHow to diagnose stage 1 nasopharyngeal cancer\nAfter a clinical examination and medical history, a number of indications will be made by the doctor to evaluate a patient with ENT symptoms:\nENT endoscopy: uses modern specialized instruments to detect abnormalities in the nasopharynx. Endoscopy helps to observe the nasopharyngeal mucosa to find abnormalities. Through endoscopy, the doctor can prescribe a biopsy of a small sample of the tumor for pathology testing when malignancy is suspected.\nEar, nose and throat endoscopy helps detect nasopharyngeal cancer at an early stage\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Compared with CT, MRI helps evaluate the tumor condition, invades surrounding soft tissues better, helps diagnose the stage of the disease as well as in planning tumor radiotherapy when with indication.; Computed tomography (CT) or PET/CT: This technique aims to accurately determine the size, shape, degree of invasion of the tumor to surrounding tissue areas, and the status of distant metastases to organs. other organs such as bones, lungs,...; Analysis of EBV DNA in plasma: EBV DNA in plasma serves as a marker to evaluate the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal cancer. Evaluating EBV DNA before and after treatment has prognostic value for patients with nasopharyngeal cancer, especially when EBV DNA levels in the blood remain high after treatment, indicating a high risk of disease recurrence and distant metastasis. , thereby orienting the choice of subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy.\nMagnetic resonance imaging helps evaluate the tumor condition to plan treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer\n\nHow to treat stage 1 nasopharyngeal cancer\nAfter examining and classifying the stage of nasopharyngeal cancer, depending on the stage of disease progression as well as the patient's health status, doctors conduct consultations and apply effective treatment methods. Safe and suitable for the patient's condition. (3)\nMSc. Dr. Luu Thao Ngoc said that for patients with stage 1 nasopharyngeal cancer, radical radiotherapy (RT) alone is often prescribed. This method has proven to be highly effective in the local treatment of head, face and neck tumors, including nasopharyngeal cancer. With state-of-the-art radiotherapy techniques such as high dose modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) doses to help destroy the tumor, while minimizing the dose affecting valuable healthy organs of the head - face - neck area, reducing side effects. side effects as well as long-term complications in patients.\nTo schedule an examination, consultation and treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer with an Oncologist, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nStage 1 nasopharyngeal cancer can be cured if detected early and treated properly. Therefore, you need to take care of your health by having regular check-ups and health screenings. At the same time, as soon as there are signs of abnormalities in the pharynx or pharynx, it is necessary to see a specialist for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.",
