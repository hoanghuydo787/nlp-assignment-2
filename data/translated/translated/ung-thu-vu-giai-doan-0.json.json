    "content": "Breast cancer stage 0: Don't be subjective in the pre-cancer stage\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, the 5-year survival rate of the disease\nStage 0 breast cancer is nearly 100% if detected early and treated promptly.\n\nWhat is stage 0 breast cancer?\nStage 0 breast cancer is also called “mammary carcinoma in situ”. (first)\nThere are 3 groups:\nDCIS – Ductal carcinoma in situ; LCIS ​​– Lobular carcinoma in situ; Paget's disease of the nipple\nDuctal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)\nThis is a type of non-invasive cancer where cancer cells are found in the lining of the mammary ducts, having not spread beyond the ducts or lobules into surrounding breast tissue. Ductal carcinoma in situ is a very early cancer with a very high cure rate. But if not detected and treated promptly, the disease can invade surrounding mammary tissue. (2)\n\nExplanation of T, N, M classification in stage 0 breast cancer\nThe breast cancer staging system is the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system.\nThe TNM staging system is based on the size and spread of the tumor (T = Tumor), metastasis to lymph nodes (N = Node) and metastasis to other parts of the body ( M = Metastasis). The numbers or letters following T, N and M provide detailed information about these elements. (3)\nAccording to TNM, stage 0 can be grouped as follows:\nTis: Indicates carcinoma in situ (DCIS, or Paget's disease of the breast).; N0: Cancer has not spread to nearby lymph nodes; M0: cancer has not spread to other parts of the body.\nOnce determined, the T N and M factors will be combined and give an overall stage of 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4.\nSee more:\nStage 1 breast cancer; Stage 2 breast cancer; Stage 3 breast cancer; Stage 4 breast cancer\n\nDoes stage 0 breast cancer have symptoms?\nAccording to the article with professional advice by Dr. Tran Thi Thien Huong, Department of Oncology, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, stage 0 breast cancer has almost no symptoms, patients only detect it. during routine health checks or when examined for other diseases.\n\nDiagnosed with stage 0 breast cancer\nMethods for diagnosing stage 0 breast cancer include:\nMammography: This is a diagnostic method with a high accuracy rate and is often used in breast cancer screening. Tam Anh General Hospital applies the digital mammography system (DBT) - Mammomat Inspiration to help increase the cancer detection rate by up to 40% and reduce the false positive rate with corresponding data.; Ultrasound: Can evaluate the nature and size of breast tumors; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Indicated in some special situations. Tam Anh General Hospital is equipped with a German magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system applying \"Full biological matrix\" technology, saving 50% of scanning time, giving outstanding diagnostic results, minimizing radiation compared to standard procedures.; Biopsy of breast lesions for histopathological diagnosis: Must be performed to definitively diagnose breast cancer. One or a combination of multiple biopsy methods can be used such as fine needle aspiration (FNA), or core biopsy with a large needle (Core biopsy) or partial/complete tumor biopsy by surgery. art.\nThe digital mammography (DBT) system at Tam Anh General Hospital helps detect stage 0 breast cancer for timely treatment.\n\nHow to treat stage 0 breast cancer?\nIn most cases, patients with localized breast cancer can choose between breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and simple mastectomy. (4)\nBreast conservation surgery (BCS)\nIn breast conserving surgery (BCS), the surgeon removes the tumor and a portion of the normal breast tissue around it. After breast-conserving surgery, patients often receive whole-breast radiotherapy to reduce the risk of cancer recurring in the remaining breast tissue.\nThe main advantage of breast conservation surgery is that it helps women preserve most of their breast. Some women may worry that less extensive surgery could increase the risk of the cancer recurring. Studies following thousands of women with stage 0 cancer for more than 20 years show that when breast-conserving surgery is performed with postoperative radiation therapy, five-year survival is the same as when breast-conserving surgery is performed with postoperative radiation therapy. mastectomy.\nTotal mastectomy\nThis method is often indicated in the following cases:\nThe area of ​​in situ ductal cancer is very large.; The breast has multiple distinct areas of ductal cancer in situ in different quadrants (multicentric).; Breast-conserving surgery cannot completely remove local ductal cancer (meaning the surgical specimen still has cancer cells in or near the surgical margin).\nWomen who have a mastectomy for in situ ductal cancer usually do not need radiation therapy and may choose to have breast reconstruction immediately or later.\nHormone therapy after breast surgery\nIf the ductal cancer in situ is hormone receptor positive (Estrogen or Progesterone), the patient may be treated with Tamoxifen or an Aromatase inhibitor, such as Exemestane or Anastrozole.\n\nSome frequently asked questions about stage 0 breast cancer\nCan stage 0 breast cancer recur?\nStage 0 breast cancer can still recur after treatment. However, this rate is very low, so patients need to have regular check-ups so that doctors can monitor them, detect abnormalities early and treat them promptly.\nWho is at risk of stage 0 breast cancer?\nAnyone is at risk for stage 0 breast cancer. Your risk increases if you have a direct relative with breast cancer or if you carry a genetic mutation that causes breast cancer, such as BRCA1/BRCA2.\nWhat to do after breast surgery?\nAfter treatment for stage 0 breast cancer, patients still have a risk of recurrence or developing invasive breast cancer in the future. Therefore, patients need to comply with regular check-ups and regular tests to monitor the disease.\nAfter treatment for stage 0 breast cancer, patients need to be re-examined according to the doctor's appointment to prevent breast cancer from recurring.\nPatients often worry after being diagnosed with stage 0 breast cancer. However, the 5-year survival rate if treated promptly at this stage is extremely high (nearly 100%). Therefore, Dr. Tran Thi Thien Huong recommends that when suffering from stage 0 breast cancer, patients need to go to reputable hospitals with specialized Oncology to be consulted to come up with an effective treatment regimen. , improving quality of life.",
