    "content": "Bone cancer: Causes, signs, treatment and prevention\n\nBone cancer (osteosarcoma) has a high frequency of detection in children and adolescents, from 9 to 19 years old. Not only does it threaten life, the disease also causes disability, loss of limb function, and affects the patient's quality of life. So what are the causes and signs of this disease and how to treat it?\n\nWhat is bone cancer?\nBone cancer is a disease that occurs when a tumor or an ABNORMAL mass of tissue forms in the bones. This type of cancer connects three types of cells: bone-forming cells, cartilage-making cells, and connective cells of bone tissue. A tumor is considered malignant (cancerous) when it grows strongly and spreads to other parts of the body. (first)\nOne thing we need to note is that the term “bone cancer” does not include cancers that start elsewhere in the body and metastasize to the bones. Metastatic cases are often named after where they start, such as breast cancer/lung cancer with bone metastases.\nTumors can start in any bone location in the body, but long bones (tibia, femur, humerus) or flat bones (pelvis, scapula) are often where signs are detected. signal.\n\nClassification of malignant bone tumors\n1. Primary bone cancer\nPrimary cancer is the most serious type of disease. Malignant tumors form directly in bone or surrounding tissue, such as cartilage. (2)\nThis is a rare disease, accounting for about 1% of all cancers. The disease most commonly occurs in adolescents and young people under 30 years old, but about 10% of cancer cases develop in people between the ages of 60 and 70. Bone tumors often appear in the bones of the hands, feet, and hands. leg bones or pelvis.\n2. Metastatic bone cancer (secondary)\nCancer can also spread or metastasize from another part of your body to your bones. Secondary osteosarcoma occurs more commonly than primary osteosarcoma.\nCommon secondary cancers include:\nMultiple Myeloma\nThe most common type, multiple myeloma occurs when cancer cells grow in the bone marrow and cause tumors in various bones. The disease often appears in older people. This is the disease with the best prognosis and many people with it do not need treatment.\nOsteogenic Sarcoma\nOsteosarcoma, or osteosarcoma, usually affects children and adolescents, but can also occur in adults. The disease tends to originate at the ends of the long bones in the arms and legs. Additionally, this type of malignant bone tumor can also start in the hip, shoulder, or other locations. It affects the hard tissue that provides the outer layer of bones.\nChondrosarcoma\nChondrosarcoma can occur in the pelvis, thigh and shoulder areas of older people. This is the second most common primary cancer involving bones. It forms in the subchondral tissue, which is the tough connective tissue between your bones.\nImage of a giant chondrosarcoma tumor (cartilage cancer) after being removed from the patient's body at Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi\nEwing's Sarcoma\nEwing's sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that begins in the soft tissues surrounding bones or directly in the bones of children and young adults. The long bones of the body, such as the arms, legs, and pelvis, are often affected.\n\nCauses of bone cancer\nThe cause of cancer in bones is not precisely known, but there are certain factors that may contribute to or increase the likelihood of abnormal growths forming in a person's bones. The following are possible risk factors: (3)\nGenetic factors: having a family history of cancer, especially cancer involving bones or cartilage;; Have had treatment or radiotherapy in the past;; Paget's disease: is a condition that causes bones to break and then grow back abnormally;; There are current or past tumors in cartilage, which is the connective tissue in bones.\n\nSigns of malignant bone cancer\nAny signs of pain and swelling in bones and joints should be monitored by a specialist to prevent the risk of bone cancer.\nSymptoms are often detected according to each stage of disease development. (4)\nIn the early stages, symptoms do not appear clearly, patients often do not pay attention and are easily ignored, such as: sore limbs, bone pain and weaker movement.\nAs the tumor progresses, the symptoms also change according to the tumor's growth rate. Patients may experience some symptoms such as:\nThe feeling of bone pain gradually increases, the pain is continuous, the pain spreads to neighboring areas;; The bone pain site shows signs of swelling;; Always feeling tired, possibly accompanied by a mild fever;; Unexplained weight loss;; Bones break easily;; Palpable hard, solid lymph nodes in the long bones of the limbs.\nAs a cancerous tumor develops, the patient may experience many symptoms, but pain is the most common. Arthritis, osteoporosis or injury can mimic many of the symptoms. If you experience one or more of the above symptoms, the patient needs to see a doctor to perform accurate diagnosis methods, promptly detect tumors and receive advice from a specialist.\nAny signs of pain, fatigue, or joint swelling should be monitored by a specialist to prevent the risk of cancer.\n\nDiagnostic methods\nDr. Vu Huu Khiem - Head of Oncology Department, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, said that the diagnosis of primary bone cancer depends on each stage. These stages describe where the cancer is located, how it progresses, and how it affects other parts of the body:\nStage 1: does not spread from bone.; Stage 2: has not spread but may be invasive, making it a threat to other tissues.; Stage 3: the tumor has metastasized to one or more areas of the bone and is invasive.; Stage 4: the tumor has spread to the tissues around the bones and to other organs such as the lungs or brain. This is considered the final stage of bone cancer.\nDoctors can use the following bone cancer screening methods to determine the advanced stage of cancer cells:\nBiopsy, the analysis of a small tissue sample to diagnose cancer;; Bone scan, checking the condition of the bones;; Blood tests;; Diagnostic imaging includes X-rays, MRI scans and CT scans to get an in-depth look at the structure of the bones.\n\nBone cancer treatments\nEvery cancer is as unique as the person fighting it. In the age of precision medicine, with advances in diagnostic and treatment techniques, fighting bone cancer requires personalized care, provided by experienced, trained professionals. specializes in this field.\nTreatment will depend on each patient's condition, specifically evaluated according to factors: cancer stage, age, overall health, size and location of the tumor.\nThere are 3 treatment methods including:\nSurgery: Patients may have surgery to remove tumors or affected tissue. The purpose of the surgery is to remove and replace damaged bone. This method helps prevent cancer from spreading quickly.; Chemotherapy: Using chemicals and special drugs to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy can be used to shrink the tumor size to support surgery, or used to destroy remaining cells after surgery and prevent recurrence.; Radiation therapy: Using controlled radiation to damage, prevent the growth and destroy cancer cells.\n\nBone cancer treatment at Tam Anh General Hospital\nTreating malignant bone tumors is always a challenge for doctors, requiring the coordination of many specialties. In particular, cancerous lesions in the extremities, related to functional activities, have even different treatment requirements. Not only must we ensure radical tumor removal surgery, but we must also ensure the following requirements: on motor function and aesthetics for patients.\n“For bone cancer, surgery plays a major role. However, surgical strategy is a key and important point, not only affecting cancer treatment but also affecting function, aesthetics, physiology and overall quality of life of the patient. , family\", Dr. Vu Huu Khiem shared.\nTherefore, choosing a treatment regimen and strategy is extremely important. Experienced experts have given the following treatment priorities:\nThe first is the patient's life;; Second is the integrity of the body;; Third, the body has a function;; Fourth, the body has function and aesthetics;; Fifth, the patient integrates into society normally, both mentally and socially.\nIn particular, the trend of preserving limbs is the main trend in surgery today, replacing previous views of limb amputation. “To preserve the limb to meet high aesthetic and functional requirements, the surgeon must have complete knowledge of bone and joint reconstruction as well as software intervention techniques such as flap coverage, tendon transfer, etc. ”, said Dr. Khiem.\nMany patients have escaped the risk of limb amputation and improved their quality of life thanks to limb preservation treatment at Tam Anh General Hospital.\nSee more: Miraculous \"resurrection\" of limbs for pediatric bone cancer patients\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with experts at Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nBone cancer in particular and cancer in general are the diseases of the century. Humans are still having a headache to \"fight\" with it every day. One of the important factors to ensure successful cancer treatment is to perform treatment when the tumor is in its early stages. Therefore, regular health check-ups every 6 months are essential to detect cancer cells early.",
