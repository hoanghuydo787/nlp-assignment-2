    "content": "Tonsillitis: Causes, symptoms and treatment\n\nTonsillitis is one of the common ear, nose and throat diseases in children and adults. According to statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), the rate of people with respiratory diseases globally is up to 73.7%. Of these, about 30.6% of people have tonsillitis. The disease often recurs many times and can easily cause complications, greatly affecting the patient's life, work and health.\n\nWhat is tonsillitis?\nTonsils are considered an \"armor\" that protects the respiratory system: they help prevent the invasion of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that cause damage to the respiratory system and produce immunity for the body. However, because it is the first barrier, this part is often exposed to bacteria and viruses. And, when there are too many attacks from harmful agents, the tonsils are weakened, easily falling into a state of swelling and inflammation.\nIf tonsillitis is left untreated, it can increase the risk of many dangerous diseases\nTonsils are lymphoid organizations at the back of the throat, with a unique structure that has many small slots and cavities, so they accidentally become a place for disease-causing agents. In addition, Vietnam's hot and humid climate contributes to creating favorable conditions for bacteria and viruses to grow. This explains the situation in which many people have recurring tonsillitis many times a year.\nIn addition, the weakened immune system in children and the elderly creates more opportunities for viruses and bacteria to attack. Therefore, this is a group of people at high risk of getting the disease.\nFunction\nTonsils are the area that produces IgG antibodies and is a specific immune barrier for children. However, when children enter puberty, their tonsils decrease in their ability to function.\nWhen the body is in a healthy state, the tonsils act as a filter, protecting the body and the nasopharyngeal system from harmful agents. However, in some cases, tonsillitis recurs many times, leading to the risk of dangerous syndromes such as peritoneal abscess, sleep apnea, etc. This has a significant impact on overall health. (first)\n\nSymptoms of tonsillitis\nSymptoms of tonsillitis are inflammation and redness. At a more serious level, the patient finds it difficult to breathe through the mouth. Accordingly, signs of tonsillitis include:\nSorethroat; Tonsils are swollen and red; White or yellow coating appears; Painful blisters or ulcers appear on the throat; Headache; Loss of appetite; Ear hurt; Difficulty swallowing; Swollen lymph nodes in the neck or jaw; Fever and chills; Halitosis; Hard-to-hear or muffled voice; Stiff neck\nFor children, additional symptoms may appear such as:\nAbdominal discomfort; Vomiting; Stomach-ache; Drooling; Anorexic\nConsidered a common disease in children. In fact, every child can get tonsillitis at least once in their life.\nIf symptoms last less than 10 days it is called acute tonsillitis. Inflammation that recurs many times a year is considered chronic tonsillitis. (2)\n\nCauses of tonsillitis\nAssociate Professor, Dr. Le Minh Ky, Head of Department of Ear, Nose and Throat, Tam Anh General Hospital, said that in adults, the cause of tonsillitis is due to a weakened immune system, which is susceptible to adverse factors such as bacteria (Streptococcal... ), virus (flu, Parainfluenza, herpes simplex, Epstein-Barr...) attack. In addition, increased use of alcohol and tobacco also causes tonsillitis in adults to increase.\nFactors such as sudden changes in weather, environmental pollution, toxic dust; Patients with a history of adenoiditis, sinusitis, tooth inflammation... are also at higher risk of getting the disease than normal people. Accordingly, some causes of tonsillitis are:\nHave ever had respiratory diseases or infectious diseases such as whooping cough, measles...; Poor oral hygiene; Have abnormalities in the throat or tonsils; Polluted environment (smoke, poor hygiene...); Using unsanitary food or frozen products (such as ice cream, ice...); The weather changed suddenly\n\nSick subject\nTonsillitis can occur in many ages, especially people with a history of respiratory diseases, diseases related to the airways such as rhinitis, sinusitis... If not treated completely, the disease can easily recur. leading to a chronic condition.\nIn addition, young children are also a high-risk group because:\nChildren often get tonsillitis caused by bacteria, most commonly in children aged 5 - 15 years old.; School-age children often have close contact with friends in school, and are very susceptible to viruses or bacteria that cause tonsillitis.\n\nMethods for diagnosing tonsillitis\n1. Clinical examination\nDiagnosis is based on clinical examination of the patient's throat. The doctor can also take throat fluid by using a swab to gently swab the patient's throat. After being collected, the specimen will be sent to the laboratory to determine the cause of the infection.(4)\n2. Testing\nYour doctor may also order blood tests to check whether the infection is viral or bacterial. From there, the appropriate treatment direction is given.\n\nClassification of tonsillitis\n1. Acute tonsillitis\nThe first sign of acute tonsillitis is a body temperature of 39-40 degrees Celsius, a feeling of dryness in the throat and pain when swallowing or coughing. Further symptoms may appear such as a white tongue, red and swollen throat mucosa; The whole body feels tired, has loss of appetite, and shows signs of little urination and constipation.\n2. Chronic tonsillitis\nIf this condition recurs many times, it will lead to chronic tonsillitis with symptoms similar to acute inflammation but accompanied by a number of other symptoms such as:\nMouth smells bad; Fever returns many times; Feeling of lump in the throat when swallowing food or drinking water; Poor physical condition, weakness and possibly fever in the afternoon; Intermittent dry cough, expectoration with phlegm and often prolonged coughing spells; Voice changes due to frequent coughing, causing sore throat and throat irritation; Wheezing, snoring in adults, children may experience sleep apnea syndrome\nChronic tonsillitis can also cause tonsil stones. This is due to material particles such as dead cells, saliva, and food accumulating in the interstices of the tonsils. After a while, the debris can harden into small pebbles. They may fall off on their own, or require medical procedures to remove.\n3. Excessive tonsillitis\nHypertrophic tonsillitis originates from chronic tonsillitis. The pathogens present in the tonsils are just waiting for the opportunity to move into the overgrowth stage. When entering this stage, patients often have fever, sore throat, and swollen tonsils. Symptoms are similar to acute tonsillitis but will last longer. Hypertrophic tonsillitis occurs about 4 times per year.\n\nMethods of treating tonsillitis\nThere are many methods to treat and cure tonsillitis such as: (5)\n1. Medical treatment (medication...)\nIf the cause of the inflammation is determined to be a bacterial infection, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics. Patients need to take the correct and full dose as prescribed even when symptoms are completely gone. This helps prevent the infection from getting worse or spreading to other parts of the body. There is even a high risk of rheumatic fever and severe kidney inflammation if you do not follow your doctor's dosage.\n2. Apply folk remedies\nSome folk remedies help reduce symptoms and speed recovery:\nGargling with salt water: Gargle in a face-up position, head tilted back, and gently blow so that the salt water comes into contact with the throat and tonsils. Can be done multiple times a day.; Gargling with salt water: Gargle in a face-up position, head tilted back, and gently blow so that the salt water comes into contact with the throat and tonsils. Can be done multiple times a day.\nGargle with onion juice: Ingredients: one onion, one glass of warm water. Peel the onions, wash them and squeeze out the juice. Mix onion juice into a glass of warm water. Stirred. Gargle with this mixture about 2-3 times a day.; Gargle with onion juice: Ingredients: one onion, one glass of warm water. Peel the onions, wash them and squeeze out the juice. Mix onion juice into a glass of warm water. Stirred. Gargle with this mixture about 2-3 times a day.\nGinger and honey: Ingredients: honey and 2 ginger roots. Peel the ginger, wash it, crush it or cut it into slices and put it in a bowl. Pour in honey to soak. Every day, you suck on ginger and honey several times until the inflammation symptoms completely disappear.; Ginger and honey: Ingredients: honey and 2 ginger roots. Peel the ginger, wash it, crush it or cut it into slices and put it in a bowl. Pour in honey to soak. Every day, you suck on ginger and honey several times until the inflammation symptoms are completely gone.\n3. Surgical treatment (Surgery)\nAfter all the above solutions, tonsillectomy is the optimal solution to completely treat tonsillitis.\nFlexible endoscopy system has the ability to observe deep inside the nasal passages, ears, throat and larynx to accurately diagnose upper respiratory tract infections.\nTonsillectomy may also be performed if complications that are difficult to control occur such as:\nDifficulty breathing while sleeping; Difficulty breathing; Difficulty swallowing; The abscess does not improve with antibiotic treatment\nAlso according to Associate Professor, Dr. Le Minh Ky, tonsillitis is a common disease and can be treated at home. However, if tonsillitis recurs many times a year, it affects the health and quality of life of the patient. You need to see a doctor to be prescribed effective treatment methods. Tonsillectomy helps eliminate inflammation in the oropharynx, improves health and limits respiratory diseases.\nRefer to the advice clip of Doctor of Medicine Diep Phuc Anh about tonsillitis. Understand the cause of the disease, signs and symptoms and is tonsillectomy painful?\nHowever, tonsillectomy surgery is not indicated for those who:\nPatients with congenital or acquired hemostasis disorders (Hemophilia A, B, C; myelosuppression, thrombocytopenic purpura, leukemia...); The patient has a systemic or local infection; Patients with chronic diseases whose treatment is not stable; People in areas with epidemics; Women who are pregnant or menstruating…\nCurrently, Tam Anh General Hospital System is implementing Plasma technology in the treatment of tonsillectomy diseases. This advanced technique is prioritized by experts for 5 reasons:\nPlasma technology performed at Tam Anh General Hospital helps effectively treat upper respiratory tract infections, especially tonsillitis.\nSurgery time is quick; Plasma knife has the ability to cut, burn and stop bleeding simultaneously during surgery, minimizing the risk of bleeding; Limit damage to surrounding tissues thanks to energy waves that destroy inflamed tissues at the right temperature, without causing burns; Uncomplicated; With little pain, patients can leave the hospital within 24 hours after tonsillectomy and recover quickly\nFurthermore, the thin, flat surgical blade structure, smart probe and electronic endoscopic optic allow the surgeon to accurately access the infected areas that need to be removed and minimize damage to the organs. neighboring tissues, reducing recurring inflammation.\n\nComplications of tonsillitis\nProlonged tonsillitis not only affects life and activities but also has many consequences.(3)\n1. Local complications\nIf the tonsils are inflamed or swollen frequently, it can cause more serious complications such as:\nShortness of breath; Sleep apnea; Infection spreading deep into surrounding tissue (peritonsillar cellulitis); Infection causes collection of pus behind the tonsils (peritoneal abscess); Purulent tonsillitis\n2. Adjacent complications\nPatients are at high risk of rhinitis, sinusitis, otitis media, lymphadenitis, and croup.\n3. Whole body complications\nIf tonsillitis caused by group A streptococcus or another strain of streptococcus bacteria is not treated promptly and properly, the patient will face the risk of complications such as rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis, etc.\nIn addition to the complications of tonsillitis, with the consequences, patients need to find out if tonsillitis is dangerous? Understand the level of danger as well as how to treat and prevent recurrence.\n\nPrevention of tonsillitis\n1. For children\nIn addition to taking your child to the doctor when signs of tonsillitis appear and coordinating treatment with a doctor, parents also need to take care of their child properly:\nScientific nutrition combined with proper exercise helps improve resistance and avoid disease recurrence\nPay attention to the diet to fully supplement the necessary nutrients to help strengthen the immune system and improve children's health, including: fruits (strawberries, berries...), green vegetables ( broccoli, spinach and carrots) and vitamins (vitamins C, E, A) reduce inflammation and difficulty breathing in children; Remind children to gargle regularly with physiological saline to clean their throat and mouth; Keep children's rooms and play areas clean; Remind children to drink plenty of water (including fruit juice) to rehydrate the body due to fever, while reducing inflammation and dry throat; Follow your doctor's appointment and treatment schedule to avoid recurring tonsillitis, causing many unwanted complications.\n2. For adults\nTonsillitis is very easy to recur, especially in favorable conditions such as changing weather, adults with a history of respiratory diseases or regularly smoking and eating unhealthy foods. Therefore, each person needs to proactively prevent disease for themselves and their families with the following measures:\nTake more time to rest; Drink a lot of water; Use soft foods if swallowing is painful; Use a humidifier in the bedroom; Gargle several times a day with salt water; Limit the use of foods and drinks that make throat damage worse, such as hot, spicy foods, high-fat foods, drinks that are too cold, etc.; Avoid stimulants that are not good for your health and affect the throat such as cigarettes, carbonated drinks, coffee, etc.; Keep the living space clean, eliminate pollutants; Limit loud and excessive talking to avoid damage to the throat; Keep your throat warm when the weather changes; Living a healthy lifestyle, eating scientifically (increasing the intake of nutrients rich in vitamins, vegetables, fruits, minerals, etc.) to enhance the health of the immune system; Increase exercise, maintain health, increase resistance\n\nQuestions about tonsillitis\n1. When should tonsils be removed?\nBased on the cause of the disease, the doctor will prescribe appropriate treatment methods. If all measures such as taking Western medicine and folk remedies are ineffective, combined with the fact that the disease is getting worse and repeated many times, the doctor will prescribe surgery to remove the tonsils. Therefore, tonsillectomy is the last resort after other treatment methods have been applied.\n2. Is tonsillitis contagious?\nTonsillitis occurs when this part becomes infected by a virus or bacteria. The disease itself is not contagious, but the viruses and bacteria that cause the disease can be transmitted from sick people to normal people through many different ways, especially when sick people cough or sneeze. Therefore, we need to prevent the spread of the disease with simple but effective measures such as washing hands with soap regularly, limiting contact with people who have colds, taking vitamin supplements, and increasing physical exercise. sports…\nTo schedule an examination and treatment for tonsillitis at Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact: TAM ANH GENERAL HOSPITAL SYSTEM Hanoi: 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Bo De Ward, Long Bien District , Hanoi City Hotline: 024 3872 3872 – 024 7106 6858 Ho Chi Minh City: 2B Pho Quang, Ward 2, Tan Binh District, Ho Chi Minh City Hotline: 0287 102 6789 – 093 180 6858 Fanpage: https:/ /www.facebook.com/benhvientamanh Make an appointment: https://tamanhhospital.vn/danh-cho-khach-hang/dat-lich-kham/\nTonsillitis is very common, almost everyone is susceptible to the disease.
