    "content": "Acute cystitis: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis and prevention\n\nAcute cystitis is a condition in which the bladder is damaged and inflamed due to a urinary tract infection. The reason for acute cystitis, however, is that bacteria are the leading cause of the disease. For acute cystitis, treatment is relatively quick and simple. However, the symptoms of the disease also cause difficulties for patients in daily life and activities.\n\nWhat is acute cystitis?\nAcute cystitis is a condition in which the bladder becomes inflamed and inflamed, mainly caused by bacteria. The disease mostly in women causes symptoms of pain and discomfort when urinating. The disease is relatively benign and easy to treat until the infection spreads to the kidneys. (first)\nRarer causes of cystitis are medications such as feminine hygiene sprays or spermicides, pelvic radiation therapy, and urinary catheters.\nThe main treatment is antibiotics. For simple acute cystitis, most clinicians will use antibiotics empirically depending on the local bacterial epidemiology. For complicated bladder infections: as in patients with recurring inflammation, in men, with structural abnormalities of the urinary tract... doctors will perform a urine culture to find the appropriate antibiotic for treatment.\n\nCause of acute cystitis\n1. Acute bacterial cystitis\nMost cases of acute cystitis are caused by infection. There are many types of bacteria that can cause this urinary tract infection. Some known names include: Escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus proteus mirabilis, gonococcus, green pus bacillus. However, Escherichia coli is the most mentioned name with 80% of cases of acute bacterial cystitis being caused by this bacteria.\nWhen bacteria enter the bladder, they attack the mucosa and submucosa, the part that protects the bladder. Damaged bladder mucosa will become sensitive and cause typical symptoms such as frequent urination or urinary urgency.\nNormally, the mucous layer along with the urine excretion mechanism helps eliminate these harmful bacteria. When one of these two mechanisms is lost, or when the invading bacteria are large enough to overcome the protection, acute cystitis will occur.\nAs mentioned, due to differences in biological structure in the urethra, women have a higher risk of acute cystitis due to infection than men. Therefore, you need to pay attention to clean body hygiene to minimize infections that can lead to acute cystitis.\n2. Acute cystitis not caused by infection\nInfections leading to acute cystitis can also be caused by certain diseases or radiotherapy that cause the body to weaken its immunity and be easily attacked by pathogenic bacteria.\nSome diseases and health conditions can increase the risk of acute cystitis that affects the lining:\nWomen during pregnancy.; Women experience hormonal changes during menopause.; People with diabetes.; Perform radiotherapy.\nSome diseases and health conditions can increase the risk of acute cystitis that affects urine flow mechanics:\nProstate enlargement or prostate adenoma in men; Narrowing of the urethra or foreskin; Stone condition, bladder tumor\nBesides the diseases mentioned above, some medications, especially birth control pills, can also cause acute cystitis if the patient uses the wrong dosage or without the supervision of a specialist. Some medications that you need to pay attention to when taking, preferably through consultation with your doctor, to limit the possibility of acute cystitis include:\nBirth control pills; Drugs used in chemotherapy such as cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide; Spermicides\nAn additional note for women, the quality of feminine hygiene products is also one of the reasons for whether women get urinary tract infections or not. The chemicals contained in sanitary products, if not performed under professional, standard procedures, can cause bladder irritation and infection. Therefore, you need to pay attention to the quality of sanitary products to ensure that they are safe for urinary health when used.\n\nSymptoms of acute cystitis\n1. Clinical symptoms\nThe symptoms of cystitis are quite typical and you can observe and self-diagnose your condition at home before going to the doctor. Common symptoms that you can observe and self-diagnose your condition at home before going to the doctor (2):\nPain in the lower abdomen; painful urination; Feeling of constantly needing to urinate; Burning when urinating; Urine may have a foul odor, be cloudy, or contain blood; Fever, chills.\n2. Paraclinical\nNormally, doctors will give patients a urine analysis test because of the advantage of getting results quickly. Usually there will be white blood cells in the urine. If the amount of bacteria is large enough, there will be a positive nitrite reaction.; Ultrasound will show the bladder wall thickening due to inflammation; If necessary, the doctor will give the patient a urine culture to identify bacteria and use appropriate antibiotics.\n\nFactors that increase the risk of acute cystitis\nAcute cystitis is a disease that can happen to anyone at any age. However, it should be noted that acute cystitis is an infection of the urinary tract, specifically the bladder. Therefore, groups of people with habits, activities or lifestyles that are easily exposed to bacteria will be at higher risk of infection and disease than others.\nSome factors that lead to an increased risk of acute cystitis include:\nHaving sex without using protection; Use spermicidal gel or cream; Women with an IUD; People with urinary catheters; People who have had cystitis; Women with hormonal changes, especially due to pregnancy or menopause\n\nIs acute cystitis dangerous?\nAcute cystitis is recognized as a relatively benign disease. Most cases can be treated simply by taking short-term antibiotics. The disease only gets worse when the infection spreads to the kidneys with symptoms of high fever, back pain on one or both sides, and signs of kidney vibration. Most require hospitalization for treatment.\n\nHow is acute cystitis diagnosed?\nWhen a patient is diagnosed with acute cystitis, the doctor will prioritize a urine test to see the parameters of white blood cells and bacteriuria in the urine. Some other cases will require endoscopy or bladder ultrasound. However, acute cystitis does not affect blood and indicators, so blood tests to diagnose acute cystitis are not necessary. (3)\nDiagnosis methods for cystitis used at the hospital include:\nUrine test: A urine test will show the number of white blood cells and red blood cells in the urine. This is a diagnostic method based on paraclinical symptoms and doctors will consider whether there are abnormalities in white blood cell indices to reach a conclusion.; Urine culture: This method also requires the patient to collect a clean urine sample, using mid-section urine. With a urine culture, the doctor will look at the types of bacteria in the patient's urine. In addition to diagnosing acute cystitis, urine culture also helps doctors determine which antibiotics the patient needs.; Cystoscopy: With this method, the doctor will use an endoscope to insert into the patient through the urethra. The endoscope will show images of the bladder including current inflammation so the doctor can accurately diagnose the disease.; Bladder ultrasound: Bladder ultrasound is also a method of observing bladder morphology. The doctor can observe fluid retention in the urinary tract, detect tumors, and the surface and walls of the bladder. From there, determine whether the patient has acute cystitis or not.\n\nTreatment methods for acute cystitis\nAntibiotics are the first-line drug in the treatment of cystitis. Some antibiotics have high concentrations in urine that are suitable for treatment such as:\nAmoxicillin; Ciprofloxacin; Nitrofurantoin; Sulfamethoxazole; Trimethoprim\nThe second drug of choice is an anti-inflammatory that helps reduce pain symptoms for the patient.\nBesides, you need to adjust your habits so that you can support your body in healing your bladder by drinking lots of water and urinating regularly.\n\nPreventive measures for acute cystitis\nPreventive measures for acute cystitis recommended by the US National Library of Medicine include:\nDrink a lot of water; Use safe measures when having sex; Keep the habit of urinating about every 3 hours; Limit the use of spermicides and IUDs. Or you need to do it under the direction and supervision of a doctor to ensure your health\nBesides, in order to prevent the disease as well as avoid recurrence, you need to maintain cleanliness and be careful with activities that have a high risk of urinary tract infection. Hopefully the above article has given you a complete concept of what acute cystitis is and how to optimally prevent the disease.\nThe Center for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts in internal medicine and surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
