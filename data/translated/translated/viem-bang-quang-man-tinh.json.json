    "content": "Chronic cystitis: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis and prevention\n\nAlthough cystitis causes patients to experience discomfort and sometimes affects some daily activities, it is still considered a simple infection with quick and inexpensive treatment. On the other hand, with chronic cystitis, the patient will have to face not only persistent symptoms but also a high risk of other dangerous complications such as: interstitial cystitis, kidney infection, CKD,…\n\nWhat is chronic cystitis?\nChronic cystitis (also known as interstitial cystitis) is a condition where damage to the bladder lining is not caused by bacteria. It may be the consequence of a recurring course of acute cystitis that is not thoroughly treated. Chronic cystitis causes similar symptoms to acute cystitis. However, these symptoms are persistent and not severe, but they are very difficult to treat completely. (first)\nChronic cystitis can cause back infections, affecting kidney function and the reproductive system. Therefore, people with chronic cystitis need to be careful of their health, follow their doctor's treatment regimen and practice building a healthy lifestyle. This not only helps patients better control symptoms and limit them from interfering with daily activities, but can also reduce the severity of the disease as well as the possibility of complications.\n\nCause of chronic cystitis\nAs mentioned, the causes of chronic cystitis are similar to acute cystitis but due to more prolonged exposure\n1. Microbial factors\nChronic cystitis is a disease that develops due to a patient having urinary tract infections for a long time or recurring many times. There are about 5 types of bacteria that cause the disease, but the most common is Escherichia coli, accounting for 70% of chronic cystitis cases. When bacteria enter the bladder through the urethra, they attack the mucosa, causing inflammation and swelling of the bladder. Eventually, symptoms of the disease will appear in humans such as painful urination, pain in the lower flank and pelvic area, sometimes accompanied by fever.\nWhen cystitis caused by urinary tract infection lasts or recurs many times, the patient will face the risk of chronic cystitis. At this time, the patient will not be able to completely treat the symptoms of the disease but can only control and improve them with medication or treatment methods prescribed by the doctor.\n2. Bladder conditions that are not treated properly\nAnother cause of chronic cystitis is that patients do not receive effective treatment for urinary diseases, especially cystitis.\nCurrently, the most popular and commonly used method by doctors to treat urinary tract infections is the use of antibiotics. This is a simple treatment method and rarely interferes with the patient's daily activities. However, if the wrong medicine is used, it will lead to the disease not being completely cured. Some cases make the disease more serious, including developing chronic cystitis. (2)\nSome urinary tract infections can be a precursor to chronic cystitis if not treated appropriately:\nDo not continue to completely treat urinary tract infection while the disease is in remission; Urinary tract infection due to disease or environment; Pain in the pelvic area that is not caused by bacteria\n\nWhat factors increase the risk of chronic cystitis?\n1. Exposure to bacteria\nAccording to statistics, most cases of chronic cystitis are caused by bacteria. When your urethra is exposed to bacteria regularly, it increases your risk of urinary tract infections, specifically cystitis. In case the urethra is continuously infected, you will face the risk of chronic cystitis.\nSituations that increase the urethra's exposure to bacteria that you may have:\nHaving sex without using protection; Not keeping the genital area clean or cleaning it incorrectly; Abuse or improper use of birth control pills and spermicides\n2. Not completely treating urinary tract infections\nPeople with cystitis are required to complete treatment and not stop treatment midway, unless directed by a doctor to limit antibiotic resistance.\nMost cases of cystitis are treated with antibiotics. Patients need to follow the exact dosage prescribed by the doctor. If the patient stops treatment before completing the treatment course, it will increase the risk of reinfection in the future.\nSpecifically, even though the patient's body has relieved the symptoms of cystitis, the bacteria have not been completely destroyed if the patient has not completed the full dose of treatment. Furthermore, Escherichia coli bacteria have the ability to reprogram the lining of the bladder, making the bladder more vulnerable. The remaining bacteria can penetrate deeper layers of the urethral mucosa and cells. At that time, the intracellular colonies have entered a dormant state and are not affected by antibiotics and have sufficient defense mechanisms.\nTherefore, patients who do not completely treat urinary tract infections have a high chance of re-infection with cystitis and face the risk of chronic cystitis because the body cannot fully respond to the effectiveness of the medication. antibiotic.\nIn addition, other factors that increase the risk of chronic cystitis that you need to pay attention to include:\nWomen in menopause; People working in contact with chemicals; Drink less water\n3. Asymptomatic cystitis\nPeople with asymptomatic cystitis are included in the list of subjects likely to have chronic cystitis.\nAsymptomatic cystitis is not uncommon in urinary tract infections. Although the patient will not have to endure the inconvenience and pain caused by the disease's symptoms, asymptomatic cystitis makes the patient unaware of their urinary health status. And if the disease persists without treatment, it will develop into chronic cystitis. (3)\nSee also: Cystitis in women: Causes, symptoms and prevention\n\nSymptoms of chronic cystitis\nSimilar to acute cystitis, chronic cystitis causes the patient urinary health problems, the most common being cramping pain in the lower abdomen, burning and stinging sensations when walking. pee. Interspersed with episodes of chronic inflammation are episodes of acute inflammation with more severe symptoms. However, for patients with chronic cystitis, each outbreak will have different intensity and severity. This also depends on the treatment process for each person.\nSome symptoms of chronic cystitis:\nAlways feel a full bladder even after urinating; Abnormally increased frequency of urination; Urethral pain every time you urinate; Pain during sex; Urine mixed with blood or dark in color\n\nDiagnosis of chronic cystitis\nCurrently, chronic cystitis is tested based on two main methods: urine testing and observation of bladder condition. (4)\nDoctors will first perform a clinical examination of the patient to understand the patient's medical history and health condition. This activity helps doctors predict patients' diseases and health problems. Then, depending on each person's symptoms and severity, the doctor will prescribe appropriate preclinical examinations.\n1. Urine test\nUrine analysis is a common laboratory method when diagnosing cystitis or diseases related to urinary tract infections.\nFor a urine test, doctors will perform analysis and find out if there are disease-causing bacteria in the patient's urine. In some necessary cases, the doctor will perform a urine culture to obtain an accurate diagnosis. A standard urine sample is a clean, midstream urine sample so the doctor can observe bacteria and white blood cells in the urine.\n2. Cystoscopy\nCystoscopy is a paraclinical method that helps doctors observe images of the patient's bladder, thereby assessing the disease condition and appropriate treatment methods.\nThrough a specialized scanner inserted into the patient through the urethra, the doctor will diagnose the disease based on images. Although this is an endoscopic method, it does not require anesthesia when performed, so the patient does not need to stay in the hospital but can be discharged immediately after the endoscopy is completed.\nAdditionally, during a colonoscopy, the doctor may also take a tissue sample from inside the bladder and perform a biopsy when necessary.\ncystoscopy\n3. Take x-rays\nThe normal x-ray examination method lasts about 45 minutes. The doctor will place a urethral tube with contrast dye inside the patient's body to the bladder to take pictures.\nThe image results will let the doctor know the patient's bladder condition through its shape and size. In chronic cystitis, the bladder wall will be thicker than a healthy bladder.\nX-ray\n\nTreatment of chronic cystitis\nFirst, patients with chronic cystitis will be advised to change their urination and drinking habits, along with a diet that reduces sweets, fats, and stimulants. Warming the bladder is also an option.\nAntimuscarinic drugs are drugs prescribed to reduce bladder muscle contractions. The doctor will inject this medicine into the patient's bladder to help strengthen the lining's protective properties.\nTo support the treatment of chronic cystitis with medication, doctors will also prescribe patients to perform physical therapy as one of the main treatment activities.\nSome ways to treat chronic cystitis besides using antibiotics include:\nChange to a healthy, nutritious diet; Limit dehydration of the body; Bladder training to control the need and frequency of urination; Understand the outbreak times of the disease to have appropriate intervention; Limit caffeine use to avoid increasing the intensity of pain\ndrink a lot of water\n\nMeasures to prevent chronic cystitis\nTo effectively prevent chronic cystitis, you need to prioritize prevention to avoid getting cystitis. Maintaining hygiene and performing regular health checks twice a year are two measures recommended by health experts. This activity helps you control and understand your health condition, limiting the possibility of the disease lasting longer and becoming chronic.\nIn case you are being treated for cystitis, you need to follow the treatment instructions from your doctor to avoid incomplete treatment to avoid a situation where the body cannot respond to the medicine in the event of a relapse. after.\nSome other measures to prevent chronic cystitis that you can apply:\nAvoid holding urine for long periods of time; Use safe measures when having sex; Drink a lot of water; Keep genitals clean\nThe Center for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts in internal medicine and surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
