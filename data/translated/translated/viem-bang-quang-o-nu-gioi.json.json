    "content": "Cystitis in women: Causes, symptoms and prevention\n\nCystitis is a common urinary tract infection with more than 40% of women having this disease at least once in their lives. Women are more at risk of this disease than men because women's urethra is shorter than men's, so bacteria can easily enter the bladder. Cystitis in women is not a dangerous disease and is relatively easy to treat. However, if not detected and treated early, it will cause serious health consequences.\n\nWhat is cystitis in women?\nCystitis in women is an infection in the bladder. This is a common urinary tract infection where more than 40% of women suffer from cystitis at least once in their lives.\nIn women, cystitis can occur at any age. There are 3 stages with the highest risk of disease that women should be careful about:\nAfter having sex; During pregnancy; After menopause\n\nCauses of cystitis in women\nThe most common cause of cystitis in women is bacteria from outside the urinary tract. When bacteria enter the bladder through the urethra, they will grow and attack the mucosa and submucosa of the bladder, causing characteristic symptoms of the disease.\nThe disease is more common in women because the urethra in women is shorter than in men. Furthermore, bacteria are more easily transmitted when the urethra, vagina and anus are quite close to each other. The inability to create an effective anti-bacterial barrier is the reason pathogenic bacteria can quickly enter the bladder. Most of the time, bacterial growth and development in the bladder can take place in a short period of time.\n\nRisk factors increase the likelihood of female cystitis\n1. Have sex\nCystitis often occurs after sexual intercourse in women. The risk of bacteria entering the bladder is greater than at other times because the urethra is now stretched. Sexual activity allows bacteria in the perineal area to easily enter the urinary tract.\n2. History of urinary tract infection\nStatistics show that 27% of women have recurrent urinary tract infections within 6 months of the first time. Therefore, the disease has a risk of recurrence in women with a history of cystitis if there is no appropriate prevention method.\n3. During pregnancy\nPregnant women will experience major hormonal changes. This cause leads to urinary health problems and creates a suitable environment for bacteria to grow and survive.\nOn the other hand, cystitis in women can also be due to residual urine in the bladder. For pregnant women, there are some cases where the fetus presses on the bladder, reducing the bladder's emptying function.\n4. Misuse of birth control pills\nBirth control pills are warned as one of the factors related to cystitis in women. Birth control pills can cause changes in the bacterial flora in the genitals.\nTherefore, when needed, you need to take birth control pills according to the instructions of your doctor or health professional to minimize unwanted side effects.\n\nSigns and symptoms of cystitis in women\nCystitis in women causes uncomfortable cramps in the lower abdomen, often accompanied by difficulty urinating, frequent urination, and painful urination.\nCommon symptoms include:\nThere is a burning sensation when urinating; Pain in the lower abdomen above the pubic bone; Frequent urination; Feeling of incomplete urination; Urine has a foul smell, is cloudy, dark or contains blood; Other symptoms: fever and nausea are uncommon\nCystitis in women is not a dangerous disease. The treatment method is also relatively simple, but has potential serious complications. You need to monitor the signs and symptoms of the disease for early detection and treatment. You can proactively treat it with antibiotics at home, but if the symptoms still do not reduce, you need to see a doctor to receive the correct treatment.\nSee also: Acute cystitis: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis and prevention\n\nComplications of cystitis in women\nCystitis in women is a urinary tract infection that can be treated with antibiotics and rarely causes complications. However, if the disease persists without treatment or is treated incorrectly, it can lead to more dangerous urinary health problems.\nComplications of the disease include:\nPyelonephritis: If cystitis is not treated promptly, long-term symptoms will have the risk of upstream infection to the kidney, also known as pyelonephritis.; Chronic cystitis; Acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease\n\nIs cystitis in women dangerous?\nCystitis in women is not a complicated disease, however, if left untreated, it can lead to dangerous complications that seriously affect health, especially kidney-related damage.\nIn addition, for patients who are pregnant women, patients need to pay attention to their health and quickly receive treatment to protect the health of both mother and fetus.\nCystitis in pregnant women can easily develop into pyelonephritis, with the risk of serious kidney damage. In addition, if the pregnant woman also has diseases such as nephritis or kidney stones, this risk will increase even more.\nNot only that, the health of the fetus is also greatly affected when the mother has cystitis. Both mother and fetus will face the following risks:\nStillbirth; Miscarriage; Premature birth; Neonatal infection\n\nMethods of diagnosing cystitis in women\n1. Urine test\nUrine analysis is the preferred method for diagnosing cystitis in women.\nThe patient is asked to collect clean urine. In order for the sample to meet standards, urine must be collected mid-stream. The doctor will perform tests or cultures if necessary. The urine sample will be examined microscopically to look for disease-causing bacteria or white blood cells.\nIn case you have symptoms of bloody urine, you need to immediately notify your doctor to perform more in-depth examination of your kidneys and bladder.\n2. Cystoscopy\nWith this method, the doctor will use a scope to observe lesions inside the bladder. The cystoscope will be inserted into the patient's urinary tract through the urethra. The doctor will observe the bladder condition and assess the level of damage to know the patient's health status. In some cases, through cystoscopy, the doctor can take a tissue sample from the lesion in the patient's bladder for a biopsy.\n\nTreatment of cystitis in women\n1. Treatment of bacterial cystitis\nBacterial cystitis is usually treated with antibiotics. The purpose of antibiotics is to kill disease-causing bacteria in the bladder.\nSome common antibiotics commonly used to treat cystitis in women include:\nCiprofloxacin, Levofloxacin, Ofloxacin; Cefuroxime, cefixime; Amoxicillin and clavulanic acid; Fosfomycin; Nitrofurantoin; Trimethoprim; Sulfamethoxazole\n2. Treatment of non-infectious cystitis\nFor cystitis in women not caused by infection, the doctor will perform a health screening and review medical history to find the source of the infection. From there, provide treatment appropriate to the cause of cystitis and take preventive measures to avoid recurrence.\nSome non-infectious causes of cystitis in women include:\nDue to use or exposure to many chemicals; Due to radiotherapy or medication use; Cystitis is a complication of other diseases.\n\nWhat measures help prevent female cystitis?\nHealth experts give some recommendations to help you effectively prevent cystitis in women:\nDrink a lot of water; Urinate as soon as you feel the need. Avoid holding urine for too long; Use safe methods when having sex and urinate immediately after sex; Except for cleaning solutions specifically for the vaginal area, avoid using soap or scented products.; Limit the use of spermicides or IUDs. You should discuss with your doctor to get advice on effective and safe birth control methods.\nThe Center for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts in internal medicine and surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
