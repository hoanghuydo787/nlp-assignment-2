    "content": "Hemorrhagic cystitis: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment\n\nHemorrhagic cystitis is a dangerous urinary tract infection. Patients can recognize hemorrhagic cystitis through the clearest clinical sign of bloody urine caused by damage and bleeding in the bladder. The disease can occur in any person and at any age. However, women and people undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been identified as high risk groups for hemorrhagic cystitis.\n\nWhat is hemorrhagic cystitis?\nHemorrhagic cystitis means the patient will experience hematuria. The disease can be completely cured by taking blood from the bladder combined with medication. However, hemorrhagic cystitis can also develop into a chronic disease in people who are receiving chemotherapy, radiation therapy or have a weak immune system. (first)\nBesides, cystitis is a diffuse inflammation of the bladder leading to bleeding. This is a dangerous type of urinary disease, with the risk of causing other health complications.\nThe bladder has the function of storing urine before it is excreted from the body. Cystitis occurs when the urinary tract becomes infected or is affected by treatment for another disease. The mucosa and submucosa of the bladder will be eroded. Bacteria and toxins attack and damage the transitional epithelium of the bladder, causing symptoms such as pelvic and flank pain, urinary urgency, urgency, and pain when urinating.\n\nCauses of hemorrhagic cystitis\nHemorrhagic cystitis may or may not be caused by a urinary tract infection. However, hemorrhagic cystitis occurs when harmful bacteria or toxins appear inside the bladder. This is considered the main cause of bladder damage, leading to bleeding.\n1. Due to chemotherapy activity\nPeople undergoing chemotherapy are more likely to have hemorrhagic cystitis than others. As for chemotherapy, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide are two drugs commonly used to kill cancer cells. However, you need to note that these two drugs have the ability to decompose into the toxic substance acrolein.\nTherefore, when acrolein reaches the bladder, the lining and bladder wall can be severely damaged and infected. This leads to bladder bleeding and hemorrhagic cystitis.\nIt should be noted that chemotherapy also increases patients' risk of chronic hemorrhagic cystitis compared to others.\n2. Due to radiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is one of the causes of hemorrhagic cystitis and chronic hemorrhagic cystitis due to weakening of mucosal function. The person performing radiotherapy must be exposed to ionizing radiation beams, which is the agent that causes blood vessels in the lining of the bladder to rupture. The effects of radiotherapy on the mucosa can last from several months to several years. Patients will be at risk of bacteria entering the bladder causing hemorrhagic cystitis. (3)\n3. Due to infection\nInfection is one of the leading causes of hemorrhagic cystitis, the most common being a urinary tract infection. Women are more likely to develop hemorrhagic cystitis due to infection than men because women's urethral structure is shorter than men's.\nEscherichia coli is the type of bacteria that causes 80% of hemorrhagic cystitis cases. In addition, proteus mirabilis staphylococcus aureus, gonococcus, and blue pus bacillus are also bacteria that cause you to have bladder problems.\nTreatment of hemorrhagic cystitis caused by mild infection will have better results than that caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Patients diagnosed with hemorrhagic cystitis due to infection should not worry too much but should carefully follow the treatment instructions from their doctor.\nSee also: Cystitis in women\n\nSymptoms of hemorrhagic cystitis\nThe most obvious symptom of hemorrhagic cystitis is bloody urine. There are 4 types of hemorrhagic cystitis corresponding to the severity of the disease. Based on the amount of blood in urine, patients can self-assess their urinary condition before going to see a doctor to be able to provide the doctor with accurate information. (2)\nThe 4 types of hemorrhagic cystitis include:\nType I: Microscopic bleeding, blood mixed in urine cannot be seen with the naked eye; Type II: Blood mixed in urine can be seen with the naked eye; Type III: Blood in urine is tiny blood clots; Type IV: The clot is large enough to prevent urine from leaving the body\nIn addition, you can also know if you have hemorrhagic cystitis through clinical signs such as:\nPain in the pelvis, pubic bone, lower ribs; Pain and burning when urinating; Abnormally increased frequency and need to urinate; Often experience urinary urgency and incontinence; Urine is dark in color, has a strong, foul smell\nThe above symptoms are similar to acute cystitis, however, the pain intensity in people with hemorrhagic cystitis will be worse due to severe infection such as inflammation and bleeding in the bladder.\n\nIs hemorrhagic cystitis dangerous?\nHemorrhagic cystitis is a serious infection that not only causes discomfort and inconvenience to the patient but also causes complications related to the kidneys.\nTreatment for hemorrhagic cystitis, especially due to infection, is not too complicated and can be completely cured. However, if the disease is not treated promptly or the disease recurs many times, it will lead to dangerous complications, severely affecting the patient's health and immune system.\nSome complications of hemorrhagic cystitis that patients need to pay attention to and prevent:\nBlood loss, anemia: If the bladder is not stopped bleeding and treated promptly, bladder bleeding will continue continuously and cause the patient to become anemic.; Kidney infection and kidney failure: Bacteria inside the bladder can infect the kidneys and cause damage to the kidneys, increasing the patient's risk of kidney failure.; Bladder cancer: Prolonged or recurring hemorrhagic cystitis is one of the factors that cause patients to face the possibility of bladder cancer.; Infertility: This complication occurs when hemorrhagic cystitis can cause infection to the genital organs, hindering ejaculation in men. These conditions are all leading causes of infertility.\n\nDiagnosis of hemorrhagic cystitis\n1. Clinical diagnosis\nFor any patient who comes to be examined for hemorrhagic cystitis, the doctor will ask questions and collect current symptoms along with medical history. This is a step for your doctor to understand your health condition and rule out risks from other diseases such as bladder stones and bladder tumors. Furthermore, based on medical history information, the doctor can also determine the cause of your infection, thereby prescribing appropriate paraclinical testing methods.\n2. Paraclinical diagnosis\nParaclinical diagnosis of hemorrhagic cystitis is laboratory tests or endoscopy, providing doctors with information about inflammation and bleeding of the bladder and bacteria in the blood and urine.\nParaclinical diagnostic methods that patients with hemorrhagic cystitis need to perform:\nBlood test: Based on blood test indicators, the doctor can diagnose the patient's blood infection. Besides, the doctor can also know if you are suffering from anemia or bleeding disorder caused by hemorrhagic cystitis.; Urine test: The doctor will observe the number of white blood cells and red blood cells in the urine. Patients with hemorrhagic cystitis have a white blood cell count in the urine above 104 white blood cells/ml. Another paraclinical sign in people with hemorrhagic cystitis is the absence of protein in the urine.; MRI or ultrasound: With this method, the doctor can observe the bladder morphology, especially the thickness of the bladder wall to draw conclusions.; Cystoscopy: The patient will have an endoscope inserted into the bladder through the urethra. Your doctor can observe bladder damage, including ulcers, inflammation, and bleeding.\n\nTreatment of hemorrhagic cystitis\n1. Use antibiotics and pain relievers\nHemorrhagic cystitis caused by infection can be treated with antibiotics. In case the patient has symptoms that are not too serious, the doctor will also prescribe this treatment method.; Antibiotics, commonly known as amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin are drugs used to inhibit the growth of bacteria inside the bladder. In some necessary cases, the doctor will also prescribe painkillers for the patient to relieve the pain.; It should be noted that when treating hemorrhagic cystitis with antibiotics and painkillers, you need to follow the dosage prescribed by your doctor. Patients must not arbitrarily stop treatment when symptoms improve or disappear. Using antibiotics incorrectly will negatively affect the body's immune system and reduce drug response in future treatments.\n2. Surgery\nPeople with hemorrhagic cystitis, if there is heavy bleeding or large blood clots, blocking the bladder, the doctor will remove the blood clots with a specialized catheter.; On the other hand, the treatment of bleeding in the bladder can also stop the bleeding with electric current or laser fulguration. To perform this method, the doctor will use a cystoscope inserted into the patient's bladder to determine the bleeding location that needs to be treated before performing hemostasis.; Cystectomy or cystectomy is the final treatment. Applicable to serious cases with high pain intensity and heavy bladder bleeding but the patient does not respond or responds poorly to other treatments.\nSee also: Chronic cystitis\n\nMeasures to support treatment and prevent recurrence\nHemorrhagic cystitis has the ability to recur and progress to chronicity if the patient does not pay attention to his or her health, lifestyle and hygiene. In order to help patients with hemorrhagic cystitis shorten treatment time and prevent recurrence, the US National Library of Medicine has recommended actions to take to help patients better control their urinary health. mine. Activities to support treatment and prevent recurrence of cystitis include:\nDrink a lot of water; Do not hold urine or hold urine for too long; Limit foods high in potassium such as coffee; Physical therapy for the bladder to improve function\nCenter for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts, Internal Medicine and Surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nThe Center's experts and doctors are always confident in mastering the latest techniques, early detecting and effectively treating kidney and urinary tract diseases, helping patients shorten hospital stays and limit risk of recurrence, improving quality of life.\nWith the leading modern machinery and equipment system in the country and the region; Operating room meets international standards; Along with a 5-star boarding area and high-class service... The Urology and Nephrology Center stands out with examination, screening and treatment services for all urinary tract diseases. From common surgeries to major high-tech surgeries.\nThese include laparoscopic kidney stone surgery, kidney transplant, tumor resection to preserve kidney parenchyma; Radical nephrectomy; Radical prostatectomy; total bladder resection and small bowel cystoplasty; adrenalectomy; shaping urinary tract defects... Diagnosis - medical and surgical treatment of all male diseases.\nTo schedule an appointment for prostate examination and surgery with leading experts at the Center for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology - Urology, Tam Anh General Hospital System, you can make an appointment online through the following methods: The following:\nCall the hotline 0287 102 6789 - 093 180 6858 or 024 3872 3872 - 024 7106 6858 (Hanoi) to register for a private medical appointment with a specialist, through the customer service staff.; Register for a medical appointment with any doctor you trust at the link: https://tamanhhospital.vn/danh-cho-khach-hang/dat-lich-kham/; Send a message on Tam Anh General Hospital Fanpage or Tam Anh General Hospital Urology and Andrology Fanpage; Text message via Zalo OA of Tam Anh General Hospital.\nHemorrhagic cystitis is a serious urinary infection that can occur in anyone. The disease is at high risk in groups of people undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Hemorrhagic cystitis can be completely treated if detected and intervened early.\nTherefore, the optimal method to prevent the disease is to clearly understand what hemorrhagic cystitis is as well as the clinical signs of the disease. When you suspect that you have hemorrhagic cystitis, you need to see a specialist immediately to be diagnosed and receive appropriate and timely treatment.",
