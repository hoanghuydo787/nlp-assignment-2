    "content": "Finger tenosynovitis: Causes, symptoms, treatment, prevention\n\nFinger tenosynovitis or finger flexor tendonitis is a common disease that directly affects daily activities. The condition presents with varying degrees of pain and symptoms. From there, the corresponding treatment methods also have many differences.\n\nWhat is finger tenosynovitis?\nFinger tenosynovitis is an inflammation of the tendon sheath of the finger flexor tendons, leading to narrowing of the tendon sheath. At this time, the fingers will have difficulty, feel pain, and become stiff when performing bending or stretching movements, especially the thumb and ring finger. The condition can occur in one or more fingers at the same time, sometimes causing serious interference with daily activities. (first)\nIn many cases, the inflammation progresses so severely that the finger is even fixed in a folded position. This condition often occurs in people whose jobs or hobbies require repetitive clenching movements. Additionally, finger flexor tenosynovitis is also more common in women and people with diabetes.\nSpecifically, the tendons in the hand are responsible for connecting muscles to bones. Contracted tendons will create normal movement for the finger, which:\nTendons in the forearm: The job is to help the fingers move, especially the thumb; Tendons at the top of the hand (extensor tendons): The task is to help the fingers perform stretching movements.; Flexor tendons on the palm: The task is to help the fingers perform bending movements.\nWhen you straighten or bend your fingers, the tendons move through small tubes, called tendon sheaths. Along this part, bands of tissue called pulleys function to keep the flexor tendons close to the finger bones. Among them, the A1 pulley (pulley at the base of the finger) is most often related to this condition.\n\nClassification of disease severity\nFinger flexor tenosynovitis is classified into 3 levels of disease. Specifically includes: (2)\nLevel 1: Tendonitis, causing local pain; Level 2: The pain feels worse but the finger can still be flexed and stretched; Level 3: The finger is stuck in a bent position, the patient must use the opposite hand to return to the original position. In addition, in many cases the finger becomes stiff in a straight position and cannot be bent (spring finger).\n\nCauses of finger flexor tenosynovitis\nIn most cases, tenosynovitis occurs due to repetitive motion or overuse of the finger leading to stress. In addition, this condition can also occur when tendons (tough bands of tissue connecting the muscles and bones of the fingers) become inflamed. (3)\nSpecifically, the tendons and muscles of the hand and arm work together to help the fingers perform bending and straightening activities. Tendons usually easily glide through the surrounding tissue thanks to the synovial membrane (membrane that surrounds the joint, has a lubricating effect).\nSometimes, tendons become inflamed and swollen. The tendon sheath is now irritated, which in the long term leads to scar formation and thickening, thereby affecting the tendon's ability to move. When this condition occurs, bending the finger, especially the thumb, will pull the inflamed tendon through a sheath, leading to a break or pop.\nSee more: Common symptoms of thumb flexor tenosynovitis\nThe danger elements:\nAge: Finger tenosynovitis often appears commonly between the ages of 40 and 60 years old.; Pathology: Diabetes, gout, rheumatoid arthritis...; Occupation: Farmer, worker, musician... (people who often have to perform repetitive movements on their fingers).; Carpal tunnel syndrome surgery: Tenosynovitis appears most commonly in the first 6 months after surgery\nThis condition is not common in children, but there are a few cases where it occurs. Inflammation affects the ability to straighten the finger, but rarely causes pain. At the same time, this phenomenon also has a high chance of automatically relieving itself when the child is 3 years old without needing medical treatment.\n\nSymptoms of finger flexor tenosynovitis are common\nFinger tenosynovitis can be easily recognized through a number of unusual symptoms, including:\nPain: The condition begins with a feeling of discomfort at the base of the finger, thumb or where the finger meets the palm of the hand. Usually, in the early stages, this is the only symptom. However, in the long term, if not treated actively, it will lead to pain even at rest; Swelling: Joint pain can cause swelling due to bursitis in the joint; Fingers are stiff or unable to move: Tenosynovitis can cause loss of the ability to flex and extend the finger. This can be estimated by flexing the finger as much as possible and then calculating the distance between the tip of the finger and the palm of the hand. Over time, patients tend to avoid positions that cause pain in their fingers. In addition, many cases still feel pain when trying to straighten completely, and long-term movement is also limited.; Some mechanical symptoms: Finger flexor tenosynovitis can cause abnormal sensation or movement, especially when performing flexion or straightening movements. The pain is usually mild at first, but as it becomes more severe, the pain can also increase.\n\nIs finger flexor tenosynovitis dangerous?\nIn most cases, finger tenosynovitis usually only causes discomfort and inconvenience in daily activities without causing serious complications. However, patients should not be subjective because of that. If the condition is not treated promptly, the disease can progress and cause many dangerous problems. Specifically:\nInfection: Easy to recognize signs are hot and inflamed finger joints; The finger will be permanently stuck in a folded position: This makes daily activities and movements very difficult and inconvenient.; Many fingers can become stiff and numb at the same time, causing pain and difficulty in daily activities.\n\nDiagnosis of finger tenosynovitis\nThe process of diagnosing finger flexor tenosynovitis is not complicated. Usually, doctors only make conclusions based on history and physical examination results. In it, the patient will perform movements of holding and releasing the hand, checking the location of pain, ability to move... The doctor can also touch the palm of the hand to check for the appearance of tumors. If related to tenosynovitis, the swollen area will move with the movement of the finger. In addition, the patient may have the following tests performed to check for related damage: (4)\nUltrasound with transducer frequency > 7.5 - 20MHz: The purpose is to check the tendon, the thickening condition of the tendon sheath, surrounding fluid, and fibrous particles in the tendon sheath.; X-ray: The purpose is to check for bone damage (if any).; MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): Purpose is to evaluate effusion or swelling of the tendon sheath, changes in tendon structure and quality...; Blood test: The purpose is to check white blood cells and erythrocyte sedimentation rate to evaluate inflammation\n\nTreatment methods for finger tenosynovitis\nInternally medical treatment\nThe majority of cases are treated medically, including:\nRest: When the finger flexor tendon sheath is inflamed, the patient should keep their hand at rest and avoid movement because it will make the condition worse; Immobilization splint: to keep the hand in the most neutral position; Perform gentle stretching exercises: The goal is to reduce stiffness and improve the range of motion of the fingers.; Over-the-counter pain relievers and inflammation reducers such as Acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can help relieve pain and inflammation effectively.; Steroid injections: Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory substances often used to inject into the tendon sheath at the base of the inflamed finger. This can relieve pain for a few days to a few weeks. If the condition does not improve, the patient will be prescribed a second injection. However, steroid injections are less effective for diabetics and can even increase blood sugar levels. Therefore, after injection, patients need to monitor Glucose levels to avoid unwanted problems.\nSurgical treatment\nIf non-surgical methods do not bring about positive improvement, surgical intervention is the last option. This decision will be based on the level of pain or loss of function in the finger. In particular, when the finger is stuck in a bent or bent position, the doctor may recommend surgery to prevent permanent stiffness.\nThe goal of this method is to release the tendon sheath, preventing the flexor tendon from being compressed. Common complications Any type of surgery has the potential for complications. In the case of surgery to treat finger flexor tenosynovitis, before the procedure, the doctor will discuss with the patient about possible risks to prepare psychologically as well as treatment measures.\nSome common complications after surgery for finger flexor tenosynovitis include:\n1. Stiffness of neighboring fingers.\nInability of adjacent fingers to straighten after surgery, even if this condition was not present before.; Temporary pain or swelling at the surgical site.\n2. Complications are rare\nThe finger has a constant clicking phenomenon, which may be a sign that the tendon sheath is too loose or the finger has other problems.; Infection.; Nerve damage, causing numbness or tingling along part of the finger.\n\nRecover\nAfter surgery, most patients are encouraged to move their fingers gently. Often, symptoms of pain in the palm of the hand may also appear. Although the incision will heal within a few weeks, swelling, pain, and stiffness in the hands and fingers may take 4-6 months to completely disappear. If it takes longer, the person may be advised to see a private hand therapist.\nIn fact, most cases experience significant pain relief as well as positive improvements in function after surgery. However, if spasticity or loss of movement occurs before surgery, mobility may not be restored.\n\nPrevention of finger flexor tenosynovitis\nFinger tenosynovitis appears with pain and discomfort, directly hindering movement and daily activities. Therefore, proactive prevention from early on is really necessary. Some useful solutions can be referred to as:\nAvoid making repetitive grasping or clenching movements.; Avoid using equipment and machinery that create vibration; Develop a full and reasonable rest regime; Add nutritious foods to your daily diet, Calcium, Vitamin C.; Grip properly sized sports equipment.; Do gentle stretching exercises to strengthen your wrists and fingers.\nCenter for Orthopedic Trauma, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is where a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons gather such as: TTND.Prof.Dr.Nguyen Viet Tien; Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa; Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh; MSc.BS.CKII Tran Anh Vu; BS.CKI Tran Xuan Anh, MSc.CKI Le Dinh Khoa, PhD.Do Tien Dung; Dr. BS.CK II Vu Huu Dung... This is also one of the pioneer units in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal diseases with modern techniques according to updated international protocols.\\\nThe hospital is also equipped with modern machinery and imaging equipment such as: Somatom Drive 768-slice CT scanner, new generation Magnetom Amira BioMatrix magnetic resonance machine, Artis Pheno robot, densitometer. bones, ultrasound machines...; Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss surgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table... to be able to detect injuries early and effectively treat musculoskeletal diseases...\nTam Anh General Hospital also owns a spacious clinic system and high-class boarding area; modern rehabilitation area; Comprehensive post-operative care process helps patients quickly recover and stabilize their health after surgery.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Orthopedics Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nAbove is a summary of useful information related to finger tenosynovitis. Hopefully with these shares, patients will have updated new knowledge to proactively prevent, detect, monitor and treat the disease effectively.",
