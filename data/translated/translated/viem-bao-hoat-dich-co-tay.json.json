    "content": "Wrist bursitis: Causes, signs and treatments\n\nWrist bursitis causes pain in the wrist area, greatly affecting the patient's health and ability to function. The disease needs to be diagnosed and treated early to prevent many dangerous complications.\n\nWhat is wrist bursitis?\nWrist bursitis is a condition in which too much fluid accumulates in the bursa of the wrist joint. This causes the patient to have inflammation and pain in the wrist. When the bursa is inflamed, moving the wrist will be difficult, negatively affecting some of the patient's daily activities. (first)\nWrist synovitis can occur in anyone, but is especially common in people over 40 years old. Because this age group has gone through the aging stage. The wrist joint must be subjected to impact and stress for a long time. If detected early, the disease can be cured in a few weeks. However, some cases may still relapse later.\n\nSymptoms of synovitis of the wrist joint\nPeople with inflamed wrist synovial membrane will have some symptoms such as: (2)\nWrist pain: The patient feels pain, as if there is a heavy object pressing on the wrist joint. The pain increases if force is applied to the wrist.; Small lumps or swelling appear on the wrist with dark red skin; The wrist joint lacks flexibility and is difficult to move. Furthermore, when performing wrist rotation, the patient feels pain and discomfort; High fever accompanied by dizziness, lightheadedness, and nausea. This condition may be a sign of bursitis related to an infection.\n\nCauses of wrist bursitis\nThe cause of wrist synovitis is that this joint has to frequently repeat strong movements. This causes the synovial membrane to be subjected to too much stress and pressure over a long period of time, leading to inflammation.\nIn addition, there are a number of factors that can increase the risk of wrist synovitis such as:\nAge: As you get older, the cartilage that cushions the wrist gradually wears away, causing the space in the joint to narrow. This creates great pressure on the bursa, causing inflammation; Infection: Bacteria, fungi, and viruses, after entering the body through the blood, can attack the synovium of the wrist joint, leading to infection, causing swelling and pain.; Other diseases: Some diseases that affect the whole body such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus erythematosus, diabetes... can increase the risk of wrist synovitis.\n\nIs wrist bursitis dangerous?\nWrist bursitis is not life-threatening when detected early and with appropriate intervention. However, if treatment is delayed, the patient may face some complications such as:\nImpaired joint mobility: This is the most common complication in people with wrist capsulitis when not treated early. The patient cannot even hold or lift objects due to the intense pain in the wrist area. This condition in the long term has a negative impact on many daily activities.; Bursitis infection: This complication is most common in people with bacterial synovitis. Bacteria when entering the synovium have the ability to multiply and develop rapidly. This causes the fluid inside to become infected. Even the outer synovial membrane can become infected and necrotic with symptoms similar to infectious arthritis.\n\nDiagnostic method\nWhen diagnosing the disease, doctors often prescribe patients: (3)\nClinical examination: Based on symptoms including heat, redness and swelling at the wrist joint; Joint fluid analysis: The doctor takes the amount of fluid around the inflamed joint and sends it for testing.; X-ray, MRI or ultrasound: The doctor may prescribe these methods for differential diagnosis of other bone and joint diseases.\n\nWill this condition go away on its own?\nDepending on the cause, inflammation can resolve on its own within a few weeks, with home treatments combined with adjustments to daily habits, specifically: (4)\nApply hot and cold compresses properly.; Give your wrists time to rest after performing exercises and repetitive wrist activities. Patients should only continue these activities when pain and swelling are controlled.; Minimize activities that put stress on your wrists such as writing, typing, gardening, playing musical instruments, lifting weights, playing volleyball, basketball, etc. Only return to these activities when you have good pain control. and swelling.; Use assistive devices such as lid openers, key turners, and large lock pullers; use utensils and kitchen utensils with large handles.; Replace doors with knobs with doors with lever handles.; Wear a wrist brace or gloves to support your wrist while sleeping or performing repetitive movements during the day.\nBesides applying home care measures, patients also need to pay attention to their daily menu. Providing the body with enough vitamins and minerals will greatly support the recovery process and prevent the risk of recurrence. Foods that patients with wrist bursitis should add to their daily meals include:\nGreen vegetables: This food group contains abundant antioxidants and anti-inflammatories, which are very good for the recovery process. You can supplement foods such as spinach, kale, carrots, pumpkin,...; Fruits such as apples, grapes, blueberries, raspberries, raspberries, strawberries, papaya, pineapple... are all good sources of powerful anti-inflammatory ingredients such as vitamins A and D.; Nuts and beans such as green beans, red beans, walnuts, almonds, pistachios, macadamia nuts...; Fresh fruit juices and green tea.\nIn addition, people with wrist synovitis should also limit consumption of foods such as:\nFoods rich in omega-6 such as mayonnaise, peanuts, soybeans...; Foods with high gluten content such as rye, wheat...; Dishes that are too sugary, salty, greasy, and alcoholic drinks such as wine, beer, etc.\n\nTreatment of wrist bursitis\nUse medicine\nWhen treating wrist synovitis, the doctor may prescribe the patient some medications such as:\nNSAID anti-inflammatory drugs: Early-stage inflammation cases with basic symptoms such as swelling and pain often require non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen. The drug helps inhibit inflammatory processes in the body. Thanks to that, the uncomfortable condition is quickly improved.; Anti-inflammatory corticosteroids: For more severe cases, corticosteroids are often prescribed instead of NSAIDs. This medication is used to reduce inflammation, swelling and pain, but only applies to cases of bursitis not related to infection. Medicines are prepared in many forms such as creams, injections, oral medications.; Antibiotics: People with bacterial wrist synovitis are often prescribed antibiotics. The drug thoroughly destroys disease-causing germs and at the same time supports the healing of infected areas in the bursae.; Injection: When the disease progresses, the doctor may prescribe corticosteroid injections directly at the site of the inflamed bursa.\nSurgery\nWhen medical treatments are ineffective, the patient may be prescribed a fluid aspiration technique to remove all excess joint fluid, thereby preventing degeneration and damage of articular cartilage.\nHow often this method is performed will depend on the severity of the inflammation. Therefore, patients should only have fluid aspiration when directed by a doctor.\n\nPrecautions\nTo reduce the risk of wrist bursitis, you should note:\nIncrease exercise for the wrist joint area with simple movements such as rotating the wrist, gently bending and stretching. These exercises will help reduce pressure on the wrist joints and relax more.; Do not perform repetitive movements that require the use of the wrist for long periods of time. If it is related to specific work such as athletes, office workers, etc., you should take some time off to relax your wrist joints.; Maintain a scientific, healthy lifestyle by controlling your weight, supplementing nutrients, avoiding alcoholic beverages, stimulants and tobacco.; When persistent pain appears in your wrist, you should see a doctor soon for diagnosis and timely treatment.\nCenter for Orthopedic Trauma, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is where a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons gather such as: TTND.Prof.Dr.Nguyen Viet Tien; Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa; Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh; MSc.BS.CKII Tran Anh Vu; BS.CKI Tran Xuan Anh, MSc.CKI Le Dinh Khoa, PhD.Do Tien Dung; Dr. BS.CKII Vu Huu Dung... This is also one of the pioneer units in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal diseases with modern techniques according to updated international protocols.\nThe hospital is also equipped with modern machinery and imaging equipment such as: Somatom Drive 768-slice CT scanner, new generation Magnetom Amira BioMatrix magnetic resonance machine, Artis Pheno robot, densitometer. bones, ultrasound machines...; Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss surgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table... to be able to detect injuries early and effectively treat musculoskeletal diseases...\nTam Anh General Hospital also owns a spacious clinic system and high-class boarding area; modern rehabilitation area; Comprehensive post-operative care process helps patients quickly recover and stabilize their health after surgery.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Orthopedics Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nAlthough not a serious health problem, wrist synovitis can cause patients to have many difficulties in daily activities. Even if not treated early and properly, the disease will progress and lead to many serious complications. Therefore, as soon as there are signs of abnormalities in the wrist joint, patients should quickly go to reputable medical facilities for early examination, diagnosis and treatment.",
