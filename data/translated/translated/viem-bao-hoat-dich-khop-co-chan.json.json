    "content": "Ankle synovitis: Causes, symptoms, treatment\n\nAnkle synovitis is a common medical condition, causing pain, discomfort and directly hindering daily activities. The disease appears with a number of easily recognizable symptoms, from which appropriate treatment methods are applied to each level of inflammation. To limit dangerous complications later, it is best that when patients notice pain, they should proactively contact their doctor for timely diagnosis.\n\nWhat is ankle synovitis?\nAnkle synovitis is a condition that causes pain, discomfort and directly affects daily activities. Specifically, the synovium at this location are small fluid-filled sacs that perform the task of reducing friction between tendons and bones. These include: Achilles, Retrocalcaneal, and Medial Malleolus, which can be inflamed independently or at the same time. (first)\n\nCommon symptoms\nAnkle synovitis is divided into two main types: acute and chronic. Each condition will have different symptoms, specifically:\n1. Acute\nThe condition often results from injury, infection or joint disease. Common symptoms include:\nPain when palpated.; Joint range of motion is narrowed.; The patient feels severe pain when moving; The pain becomes severe when performing contractions or extensions due to compression of the muscles.; In case of bursitis due to infection, the skin temperature will increase, which can differ from the initial temperature level by about 2.2 degrees.\n2. Chronic\nChronic bursitis often occurs due to repeated injuries or excessive pressure on the joint. This condition is usually not painful. However, over time, the increased amount of fluid will lead to swelling.\nIn general, most patients with ankle bursitis notice the following common symptoms:\nPain in the back of the ankle; Limp.; The range of motion of the ankle is limited.; The ankles are tight; The skin of the ankle is swollen, red and hot; Find it difficult to perform weight-bearing activities such as running, standing, etc.\n\nCauses of ankle synovitis\nAnkle synovitis occurs due to many different causes, including: (2)\nExcessive exercise or repetitive movements such as walking, running, jumping... puts pressure on the ankle joint.; Practicing sports, especially climbing high but not warming up thoroughly before.; Wearing ill-fitting shoes, high heels... puts pressure on the ankles, the condition will only get worse if this habit is not changed.; Infection caused by Staphylococcus Aureus, Streptococci or some harmful fungi.; The ankle joint has been injured before.; Pathology: gout, rheumatoid arthritis...; Ankle injury or strong impact.\nThe danger elements:\nThe body is often exposed to cold weather and low temperature environments; The patient has a history of ankle capsulitis; Participate in sports that require a lot of contact (soccer, basketball...).; People who often have to stand continuously for many hours such as working in sales, security, etc.\n\nSymptoms\nAlthough ankle bursitis can still heal on its own, many cases still require medical care and intervention. Subjective failure to treat early can easily make the condition worse, thereby leading to a number of serious complications such as:\nThe inflamed area becomes permanently thick and enlarged; The expansion of the inflammatory area causes surrounding structures to be seriously compressed, causing pain every time you move; The pain limits the mobility of the ankle, and in the long term there is a risk of atrophy of the surrounding muscles.; Ankle bursitis occurs more often in women than in men due to the habit of using high heels for a long time.\n\nDiagnostic method\nThe doctor will examine the patient's ankle, ask some questions about the injury, exercise habits, pain level... After that, a number of diagnostic methods can be performed to come to a conclusion. Most accurate conclusion about inflammation: (3)\nBlood tests: Blood tests are done to check for infections or certain diseases that can cause bursitis in the ankle joint.; Ultrasound: This method helps to make a general assessment of the thickness, amount of fluid in each bursa, and stiffness of the ankle tendons.; X-ray or MRI: This method will help doctors determine problems related to bone position, arthritis or bone fractures... In addition, contrast agents can also be used to Helps the image of the ankle appear more clearly. However, patients need to inform their doctor if they have ever had an allergic reaction to this liquid. Metal is also an object that cannot be brought into the MRI room because it can easily cause serious injury.; Fluid culture: A fluid culture test is done to check for infection. With this method, the doctor will use a needle to suck fluid from the bursa and then bring it to the laboratory. In addition, eliminating fluid is also a way to reduce pain symptoms.\n\nTreatment of ankle bursitis\nNon-surgical treatment\nFor mild ankle synovitis, the patient absolutely does not need surgical intervention. Some internal medicine methods that can be applied include: (4)\n1. Care and treatment at home\nKeep the ankle at rest.; Apply ice to the ankle area to help reduce swelling and pain. With this method, the patient can use an ice pack, then cover the bag with a towel before placing it on the compress site. Doing this regularly 3 - 4 times a day, for 15 - 20 minutes each time will bring significant pain relief.; Use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen and Aspirin to help reduce swelling, pain and fever. However, NSAIDs can cause stomach bleeding or some kidney problems. If you are taking blood thinners, you should consult your doctor before taking NSAIDs.; Using antibiotics to prevent or fight bacterial infections; Steroid injections to help reduce pain and swelling. However, in some cases, these medications can increase the risk of tendon injury, causing atrophy and infection.\nSee more: Ankle joint injection method\nUse padding according to your doctor's instructions to avoid injury and reduce pressure on the ankle area during exercise.; Use shoes of a suitable size to reduce pressure on the ankles, especially when walking.; Use a splint or cast as directed by your doctor.; If the cause of ankle synovitis is due to a medical condition, treating these diseases first is really necessary. For example, if inflammation occurs due to infection, the doctor will first prescribe antibiotic therapy for treatment, and then perform some other methods.; Walking is considered safe for patients and also brings positive improvement effects. However, patients need to use appropriate, well-fitting shoes, walk gently and not overuse them because it can easily make the condition worse.; Applying heat to the ankle area 3 - 4 times a day, for 15 - 20 minutes each time, also effectively reduces pain and stiffness.\nIn cases where bursitis occurs due to rheumatoid arthritis or gout, patients need to avoid certain foods to reduce related symptoms. As follows:\nFor gout: Patients should avoid foods and drinks that contain a lot of Purines such as wine, beer, animal organs, red meat, seafood... In addition, foods rich in Fructose are also in the group to avoid such as fruit juice, honey…\nReference: What should gout patients avoid eating?\nFor rheumatoid arthritis: Patients should avoid foods that can make inflammation worse, such as processed foods, cakes, foods containing corn oil...\n2. Physical therapy\nPhysical therapy exercises will help speed up the injury recovery process, improve range of motion and strengthen joints, muscles, and ankle bones. Specifically, patients can be guided in some of the following techniques:\nManual therapy techniques (MTT): MTT is performed by therapists, including soft tissue massage and stretching of joints to restore the ability and range of motion of the ankle. In addition, this technique also helps reduce pain effectively.; Therapeutic exercises (TE): TE includes exercises to stretch and strengthen muscles and joints. From there, the range of motion of the ankle is restored, the bursa and tendons are also brought to a stable state, effectively reducing stress.; NMR method: NMR exercises will help restore ankle stability, improve mechanical movement techniques (running, jumping...) to reduce stress on the capsule and tendons during daily activities. .; Other methods such as using ultrasound waves, cold lasers, electrical stimulation... will help reduce pain and inflammation effectively.; Physical therapy exercises at home: The main purpose is to strengthen, stretch and stabilize the ankle to help the wound recover quickly.\nOnce the initial inflammation has subsided, your physical therapist may instruct you on some stretching exercises to begin the process of restoring full range of motion. This is also a solution to improve strength as well as reduce stress on ankle tendons and joints.\nSurgery\nIf the condition of ankle synovitis is severe and medical treatments are not effective, your doctor may prescribe surgery. This is the best way to drain excess fluid from the capsule or completely remove the inflamed capsule.\nWith this method, the doctor will make an incision in the skin at the damaged site and drain the fluid. Once completed, the incision will be closed with sutures. This process does not affect muscle and joint activity at all, so it will help permanently reduce pain and swelling caused by inflammation. By eliminating the pain factor through surgery, most patients feel their symptoms improve immediately.\nAfter surgery, the doctor will advise you on some additional self-care methods to speed up the recovery process. Usually, the follow-up examination schedule is also specifically planned to ensure close monitoring of wound healing. The first time will start 1 - 2 weeks after surgery, the next time will be 4 - 6 weeks. Depending on the condition of the wound as well as each person's constitution, recovery time will vary. However, in some cases, ankle bursitis can also recur in varying degrees.\nIn addition, a new but not yet popular treatment is sclerotherapy. Specifically, the main purpose will focus on shrinking and killing stromal tissue by injecting irritants into the inflamed bursa. However, this therapy is not yet commonly applied and cannot replace surgery.\n\nPrecautions\nAnkle synovitis directly affects mobility and daily activities. Not to mention, if the condition progresses seriously but is not treated promptly, inflammation can leave many other dangerous complications. Therefore, proactive prevention from the beginning is really necessary. Some useful measures that can be applied include:\nExercise regularly, including stretching exercises such as yoga, tai chi (at least 30 minutes a day), swimming... to reduce stress on the ankle joints.; Always warm up thoroughly before exercising; Build a diet with foods that have good anti-inflammatory properties (broccoli, bell peppers, avocados...), avoid processed foods or lots of sugar as much as possible; Maintain a healthy weight to help reduce stress that leads to joint pain.; After the inflammation has been healed, to avoid recurrence, the patient should switch to gentler sports, such as cycling, yoga... instead of jogging.; Absolutely avoid repetitive movements, jerking or sudden weight increases during exercise.; Treatment of diseases that can lead to ankle bursitis such as gout, rheumatoid arthritis...; Wear footwear that fits your feet to reduce rubbing and excessive stress in the Achilles area. Sufficient width will ensure minimal compression, minimizing friction between the first and fifth ankle joints, thereby reducing the risk of disease.\nCenter for Orthopedic Trauma, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is where a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons gather such as: TTND.Prof.Dr.Nguyen Viet Tien; Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa; Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh; MSc.BS.CKII Tran Anh Vu; BS.CKI Tran Xuan Anh, MSc.CKI Le Dinh Khoa, PhD.Do Tien Dung; Dr. BS.CKII Vu Huu Dung... This is also one of the pioneer units in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal diseases with modern techniques according to updated international protocols.\nThe hospital is also equipped with modern machinery and diagnostic imaging equipment such as: Somatom Drive 768-slice CT scanner, new generation magnetic resonance machine Magnetom Amira BioMatrix, Artis Pheno robot, densitometer bones, ultrasound machines...; Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss surgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table... to be able to detect injuries early and effectively treat musculoskeletal diseases...\nTam Anh General Hospital also owns a spacious clinic system and high-class boarding area; modern rehabilitation area; Comprehensive post-operative care process helps patients quickly recover and stabilize their health after surgery.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Orthopedics Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nAbove is a summary of information related to ankle joint synovitis. Hopefully with these useful updates, patients will have more new knowledge to proactively prevent, monitor, detect and treat promptly, minimizing unwanted complications.",
