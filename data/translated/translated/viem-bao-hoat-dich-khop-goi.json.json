    "content": "Knee bursitis: Causes, signs and treatment\n\nKnee bursitis causes many inconveniences in the patient's daily activities. If there is no early treatment, the disease can lead to many serious complications such as disability.\n\nWhat is knee bursitis?\nKnee bursitis (knee synovitis) is an inflammation of the fluid-filled sac in the knee joint. The bursa helps reduce friction and is a force-bearing cushion between the ends of bones and tendons, muscles, and skin near joints.\nThe bursa anywhere in the knee joint can become inflamed. However, the area in front of the kneecap, inside the knee and below the joint is most susceptible to inflammation. This injury causes pain and limits the patient's range of motion. Treatment is often a combination of home care measures and treatments from a doctor to improve inflammation and pain.\n\nSymptoms of knee synovitis\nSymptoms of knee bursitis are very diverse. Depending on which bursa is affected and the cause of inflammation, each case will have different signs.\nSome common symptoms of knee synovitis include:\nThe knee area feels warm, swollen and painful when walking. The pain does not improve or only decreases slightly even with rest.; Factors that can trigger bursitis, such as a strong blow to the knee joint, can immediately cause many symptoms to appear. However, most cases are the result of friction as well as irritation of the bursa during movements that require a lot of use of the knee. Therefore, symptoms tend to appear from mild to severe, gradually getting worse over time.\n\nCauses of knee bursitis\nPatients often suffer from knee bursitis due to causes such as:\nThe knee joint is subjected to constant, prolonged pressure; Excessive knee joint movement; Knee injury; Bursitis infection.; Complications from osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease), gout, rheumatoid arthritis.\nSome factors can increase the risk of knee synovitis such as:\nKneeling for too long: People who work in jobs that require kneeling for too long, such as carpet workers, gardeners, plumbers, etc., have a higher risk of knee capsulitis.; Overweight and obesity: Excess body weight will create great pressure on the knee joint, gradually destroying joint cartilage; Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis causes the synovium in the joints to function less well, making it more susceptible to injury and inflammation of the synovial membrane.; Some sports: Games that are competitive, causing direct injury or falling and landing on knees such as football, wrestling, volleyball... also make players susceptible to knee synovitis .\n\nRecovery time\nWith rest and proper home care, symptoms of synovitis may disappear after a few weeks. However, if symptoms last more than 2-3 weeks after rest and home treatment, the patient should see a doctor as soon as possible for timely intervention.\nBursitis that does not go away or recurs many times is considered a chronic inflammatory condition. When knee bursitis turns into a chronic stage, treatment will be more difficult.\n\nSymptoms\nWhen detected and treated early, the disease is not a cause for concern. However, if treatment is delayed, the increased inflammation of the synovium will reduce abnormal mucus, change the properties of the knee joint fluid, thereby creating pressure on the cartilage, bones and tissues in the joint, causing obstruction. joint movement.\nSome more serious cases can have many dangerous complications such as:\nJoint deformity, joint adhesion or joint effusion; Muscle weakness and atrophy lead to reduced motor function, even disability.; Some cases of knee bursitis due to acute rheumatism can damage the heart valves, causing many chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease.; Herniated knee synovium (synovial cyst) recurs many times, causing chronic pain.\n\nDiagnostic method\n1. Medical history and clinical examination\nIn addition to collecting medical history information, the doctor will physically examine the patient to assess the time of onset and severity of symptoms:\nCompare the condition of both knees, especially when the pain appears on only one side.; Gently press on the area around the knee joint to assess swelling, heat, and source of pain.; Inspect the skin in the affected area to determine if redness or infection is present; Slightly move the patient's knee to assess the range of motion and see if pain occurs every time the knee bends or moves too much.\n2. Imaging diagnosis\nTo rule out injuries that can cause symptoms similar to bursitis, the doctor may prescribe the patient to perform some imaging tests such as:\nX-ray: X-ray results help detect bone problems or arthritis.; MRI: This method uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to create detailed images of bone and joint structures. Thereby, the doctor can observe soft tissue locations such as synovium; Ultrasound: This method helps doctors better evaluate the swelling in the inflamed bursa area.\n3. Joint fluid analysis\nIn the case of knee capsulitis, if the doctor suspects an infection or gout, a joint fluid analysis may be performed. The patient will have some fluid taken from the bursa for examination.\n\nTreatment of knee bursitis\nKnee bursitis usually improves over time. Therefore, treatment is mainly to relieve symptoms. Depending on the cause of the inflammation and which bursa is affected, the doctor will recommend appropriate treatment.\n1. Medicine\nIf the inflammation is caused by an infection, the patient will be given appropriate antibiotics. For some other common cases of bursitis, anti-inflammatory drugs such as NSAIDs (eg ibuprofen or naproxen, etc.) can be used.\n2. Physical therapy\nThe physical therapist will guide the patient through exercises to improve flexibility and strengthen the knee joint. This therapy helps improve pain and reduce the risk of recurrence of knee bursitis. In addition, using a bandage to protect your knee during exercise also helps control swelling.\n3. Surgery and other procedures\nCorticosteroid injection: If inflammation in the bursa persists and does not respond to basic treatments, the doctor may prescribe corticosteroid injections into the affected bursa to improve the condition. inflammation. After injection, inflammation usually subsides quickly. However, patients may experience pain and swelling from the injection for a few days.; Aspiration: The doctor will use a small needle to insert into the bursa and drain away the amount of inflammatory fluid. This method may cause short-term pain and swelling. After injection, the patient may need to wear a knee immobilization bandage to reduce swelling.; Surgery: If chronic bursitis is severe or recurs many times and does not respond to other treatments, the doctor may recommend surgery to remove the bursa.\n4. Lifestyle changes and home remedies\nTo improve symptoms caused by knee bursitis, patients need to:\nReduce knee joint activity: Temporarily stop activities that lead to bursitis, limit movements that make pain worse.; Using over-the-counter pain relievers: Short-term use of pain relievers and anti-inflammatory drugs such as spirin, ibuprofen or naproxen to improve pain; Apply ice: Put a few ice cubes in a towel or cold pack and apply it to your knee for about 20 minutes at a time and apply it several times a day.; Wear an elastic bandage: Use an elastic bandage or knee protection accessories to reduce swelling; Elevate your knees: Use a pillow under your knees to improve swelling.\n\nPrevention of knee bursitis\nTo prevent knee bursitis, patients should proactively protect bone and joint health early on, preventing factors that cause inflammation, specifically:\nPractice correct posture in daily life and work; Avoid overexertion and limit squatting and kneeling positions. Frequent or repetitive knee bending movements can put a lot of pressure on the knee joint. If you have to kneel for a long time, you should relax your legs by stretching and gently massaging them.; When playing combat sports, you should use specialized protective equipment to protect your knee joints.; Scientific diet, ensuring adequate nutritional supplementation; Maintain a reasonable weight.; Regularly have general check-ups (at least every 6 months) to screen for bone and joint diseases.\nCenter for Orthopedic Trauma, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is where a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons gather such as: TTND.Prof.Dr.Nguyen Viet Tien; Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa; Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh; MSc.BS.CKII Tran Anh Vu; BS.CKI Tran Xuan Anh, MSc.CKI Le Dinh Khoa, PhD.Do Tien Dung; Dr. BS.CKII Vu Huu Dung... This is also one of the pioneer units in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal diseases with modern techniques according to updated international protocols.\nThe hospital is also equipped with modern machinery and imaging equipment such as: Somatom Drive 768-slice CT scanner, new generation Magnetom Amira BioMatrix magnetic resonance machine, Artis Pheno robot, densitometer. bones, ultrasound machines...; Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss surgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table... to be able to detect injuries early and effectively treat musculoskeletal diseases...\nTam Anh General Hospital also owns a spacious clinic system and high-class boarding area; modern rehabilitation area; Comprehensive post-operative care process helps patients quickly recover and stabilize their health after surgery.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Orthopedics Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nPeople with knee bursitis who delay treatment may face a high risk of disability or loss of knee mobility. Therefore, as soon as patients have signs of abnormalities in the knee joint, they should quickly see a doctor for diagnosis and early intervention to prevent dangerous complications.",
