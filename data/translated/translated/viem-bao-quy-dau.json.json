    "content": "Foreskin inflammation: Causes, signs and prevention\n\nForeskin inflammation is a disease that affects men's health and fertility. If not treated early and properly, the disease can lead to many dangerous complications.\n\nWhat is balanitis?\nBalanoposthitis is a condition in which the foreskin and glans become swollen, painful, and uncomfortable. The cause of the disease is often harmful microorganisms, commonly fungi, bacteria, viruses, and also parasites. (first)\nThe foreskin is a thin layer of skin that covers the head of the penis and the urinary opening. When the penis becomes erect due to stimulation, the foreskin will be pulled down, revealing the head of the penis.\n\nDistinguish between foreskin inflammation and inflammation of the head of the penis\nBalanitis is often confused with two diseases: phimosis and inflammation of the head of the penis (balanitis). All three conditions affect the penis. However, each disease affects a different part of the penis. (2)\nPhimosis is a condition in which the foreskin does not fully retract from the glans.; Inflammation of the head of the penis (balanitis) is an inflammation of the glans.; Balanitis is an inflammation of both the glans and foreskin.\nPhimosis can occur along with balanitis or balanitis. Phimosis can easily cause irritation of the glans and foreskin. Once this irritation occurs, symptoms such as pain and swelling can make it more difficult to retract the foreskin.\n\nCauses of foreskin inflammation\nThere are many causes of foreskin inflammation. In particular, clearly identifying the cause will support more effective treatment of foreskin inflammation. Some common causes of foreskin inflammation include: (3)\nPhimosis: The disease prevents the head of the penis from being exposed to the outside, leading to difficulty in cleaning the head of the penis. Over time, urine residue and dirt will accumulate at the tip of the penis. This is a favorable opportunity for a series of bacteria and fungi to multiply and develop strongly.; Unhealthy sex: Another common cause of balanitis is promiscuous sex, lack of safety measures, leading to an increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea. ..., accordingly the risk of foreskin inflammation is very high.; Not cleaning or improperly cleaning the genitals: Common causes in children. Because children do not have a sense of personal hygiene; Irritability: Balanitis can occur in patients who are easily irritated by the environment or laundry products, genital hygiene products, shower gel, shampoo, etc. , the foreskin will be red and itchy for a few days, then it will stop completely.; Some diseases: Diseases such as urethritis or urinary tract infections also greatly increase the risk of balanitis.\n\nSigns of foreskin inflammation\n1. Acute balanitis\nPenis itching and discomfort; The foreskin area is red, swollen and painful; When urinating often, I feel burning and discomfort...\n2. Chronic balanitis\nThe foreskin has a foul odor and often contains blood and white pus of unknown cause.; Painful urination, burning, itching; pain during sex; Significantly reduced libido because the body is always in a state of pain, fatigue, poor concentration...\n\nWho is at risk of getting the disease?\nFactors that increase the risk of balanitis include:\nHave diabetes but do not treat it or have poor blood sugar control; Having sexually transmitted diseases such as Herpes and gonorrhea.\n\nIs balanitis contagious?\nBalanitis is not a sexually transmitted disease (STD), nor is it a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Therefore, when men get sick, they do not need to worry too much. However, you should take proper home care measures to improve this condition. (4)\n\nComplications of foreskin inflammation\nMost cases of foreskin inflammation do not go away on their own without an appropriate treatment regimen. When severe, the disease can cause the penis to change shape, leading to many dangerous complications, seriously affecting men's daily lives.\nTherefore, when there are symptoms of foreskin inflammation, patients should quickly go to reputable medical facilities for timely examination, diagnosis and treatment, to prevent serious complications.\nIf treatment is delayed, men may face complications such as:\nOnset of other inflammatory diseases: After entering, bacteria can cause ulcers in the foreskin and can develop and penetrate deeper into other organs. They cause many inflammatory diseases such as vasculitis, orchitis, epididymitis...; Reduced sexual desire: Foreskin inflammation causes men to always have pain. Therefore, patients often lose interest in sex. Over time, the disease can cause physiological dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, impotence, premature ejaculation...; Infertility and subfertility: Chronic balanitis can reduce the quantity and quality of sperm, thereby increasing the risk of infertility and subfertility.; Penile cancer: Foreskin inflammation accompanied by ulcers and pus discharge can increase the risk of penile cancer.\nForeskin inflammation reduces sexual desire\nIn addition, balanitis can cause urethritis and cystitis. In some cases, kidney function may be affected, increasing the risk of kidney failure.\n\nMethods of diagnosing foreskin inflammation\nDoctors often review medical history and examine the patient's health. In some cases, pus can be removed from the glans to determine whether the cause is bacterial or fungal. In addition, the doctor may also order a blood test if the man has serious diseases such as diabetes or syphilis.\n\nHow to treat foreskin inflammation\n1. Use medicine\nWith mild inflammation, special oral medications (antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, anti-virus, pain-reducing, etc.) will help eliminate pathogens and quickly relieve unpleasant symptoms.\nWhen treating diseases with antibiotics, doctors may prescribe certain groups of drugs such as:\nAntibiotics polymyxin, neomycin, penicillin, chloramphenicol, glycerine, sorbolene...: Treatment of inflammatory problems caused by bacteria.; Antiviral drugs such as valacyclovir or famciclovir: May be prescribed if the balanitis is caused by a virus.\nWhen using antibiotics, patients should pay attention to some important things to minimize the risk of the body developing antibiotic resistance:\nMake sure to take antibiotics at the exact dose prescribed by your doctor, no more and no less; Absolutely do not share your antibiotics with those around you. Because your medicine may not be suitable for someone else, even if they have the same disease.\n2. Surgery\nFor people with chronic inflammation who have been treated with medication but have not been effective, the doctor may recommend surgery to remove the foreskin. Currently, circumcision techniques are quite diverse, often prescribed based on each patient's age, health conditions and level of inflammation.\n\nPreventive measures for foreskin inflammation\nTo reduce the risk of foreskin inflammation, men should note:\nTreat risk factors such as phimosis, long foreskin, etc.; Clean the genitals properly every day, especially the foreskin groove. Be careful to avoid vigorous scrubbing because it will scratch and damage the foreskin; Avoid using soap and detergents that are too alkaline to clean the genitals. Because they can cause irritation, dryness and discomfort. Instead, men should choose soaps and men's hygiene solutions that have a balanced pH level.; Avoid masturbating too much: The number of masturbation times per week should only be 1 to 2. It is important that after masturbation, men do not feel tired, lose their health, or mentally affect their studies or work. job. In addition, it is necessary to carefully clean masturbation items after each use; Prioritize choosing pants with airy materials that do not tighten the private area to avoid rubbing the foreskin area, causing tightness and discomfort.\nCenter for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology - Urology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts, Internal Medicine and Surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
