    "content": "Blepharitis on the eyes: Causes, symptoms and prevention\n\nBlepharitis is a common eye disease that causes irritation and swelling and is prone to recurrence. Blepharitis includes lower eye blepharitis and upper eye blepharitis. To better understand blepharitis on the eyes, learn the causes, symptoms and prevention through the article below.\n\nWhat is upper blepharitis?\nUpper blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid along the upper edge of the eyelid. The disease occurs when a bacterial infection or clogged oil gland causes the eyes to become swollen and red. Upper blepharitis is not contagious and does not lead to blindness, but it is difficult to treat completely.\nDepending on the location, upper blepharitis is classified into 2 types:\nAnterior blepharitis: Affects the front of the eyelid, where the eyelashes come into direct contact with the eyelid. Anterior blepharitis occurs due to bacteria or dandruff on the eyelashes causing eye swelling and redness; Posterior blepharitis: Is the part located inside the eyelid where it comes into direct contact with the eye. It occurs when the oil-producing meibomian glands in the eyelids become clogged.\nUpper blepharitis affects the front of the eyelid\n\nCauses of upper eyelid blepharitis\nUpper eyelid blepharitis comes from the following causes:\nStaphylococcal infection\nThe disease is caused by Staphylococcus bacteria, with symptoms such as thicker eyelid margins and misaligned eyelashes. Staphylococcus bacteria are found on the skin, nose, buttocks and armpits but can enter the human body through cuts, insect bites on the skin, and medical equipment (such as catheters). [first]\nStaphylococcus bacteria cause a group of infections, ranging from skin and soft tissue infections to invasive infections called staph infections. Among the many types of Staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus bacteria are resistant to methicillin (MRSA) and again some antibiotics such as flucloxacillin. In addition, Staphylococcus bacteria produce Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) toxin, which kills white blood cells, so skin infections easily recur. People with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to staph infections than normal people.\nAcne rosacea: Rosacea bacteria cause inflammation of the facial skin and eyelids.; Allergies: Ingredients in contact lens solutions, eye drops, and makeup can cause eye irritation.; Seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff): Dandruff flakes off and sticks to the eyes, causing irritation and inflammation of the eyelids.; Dry eyes: Dry tear ducts reduce resistance, making it easier for bacteria to attack and cause infection.; Lice or mites in the eyelashes (demodicosis): Demodex lice or mites block the eyelash follicles and glands, causing blockage and blepharitis on the eye.; Clogged oil glands: Clogged oil in the meibomian glands leads to dry eyes, infections, and blepharitis on the eyes.\n\nSymptoms of upper eyelid blepharitis\nWhen you have upper blepharitis, you will have the following symptoms:\nWeep.; Stiff, hot feeling; Oily eyelids; Pain and itching of the eyelids; Red, swollen eyelids; Peeling skin around the eyes, around the base of the eyelashes; Sticky eyelids after waking up; Sensitive to light; Blurred vision; Excessive blinking; Eyelashes growing crookedly\nSymptoms of upper eyelid blepharitis are often evident in the morning. Upper blepharitis does not affect vision but causes temporary vision loss. Chronic blepharitis tends to recur in stages and affects both eyes. After a period of time, the symptoms subside and then the flare-up stage occurs. Some cases have other diseases that affect upper blepharitis such as acne rosacea, psoriasis, and seborrheic dermatitis. [2]\n\nComplications of upper eyelid blepharitis\nUpper blepharitis is not a dangerous disease, but if not detected and treated promptly, it will cause many complications and affect daily life.\nEyelash loss\nUpper blepharitis causes eyelashes to fall out, lose color or grow abnormally (misaligned eyelashes).\nEye scars\nIf upper blepharitis is left for a long time, it will form scars on the eyelid or next to the eyelid.\nExcessive tearing or dry eyes\nAbnormal tear flow prevents the eyes from moisturizing, leading to dry eyes.\nPhony eye\nA stye is an infection that develops near the base of an eyelash or on the eyelid, forming a papilloma that causes pain and discomfort.\nPatchwork eyes\nUpper blepharitis causes small oil glands at the edge of the eyelid to become clogged, causing blepharitis with swelling and redness.\nConjunctivitis\nUpper blepharitis can lead to recurring episodes of pink eye, also known as conjunctivitis.\nCorneal infection\nUpper blepharitis causes eye irritation, misaligned eyelashes or dry eyes, thereby increasing the risk of corneal infection.\nMaster Doctor Pham Huy Vu Tung, Ophthalmology specialist, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City\n\nRisk factors for upper eyelid blepharitis\nIn addition to pink eye and seborrheic dermatitis, there are many other risk factors for upper blepharitis such as:\nDiabetes.; Wear contact lenses.; Exposure to irritants such as dust and chemicals; Not removing makeup thoroughly; Have oily skin.; Are being treated with certain medications (such as cancer medications).; Are going through menopause or hormonal changes.\n\nDiagnose\nWhen a patient has abnormal signs in the upper eyelid, the doctor will diagnose blepharitis using the following methods:\nAsk about medical history: The doctor will ask about symptoms and health status to determine risk factors for upper blepharitis.; Examine the outer eyelid: Based on the shape of the eyelid, redness, discharge and swelling help determine the severity of upper blepharitis.; Checking secretions: Eyelid secretions are tested to help determine the type of bacteria causing upper blepharitis; Tear test: Take a tear sample to analyze whether dry eyes are a factor causing upper limb inflammation; Check eyelashes: Eyelashes are examined under a microscope to detect whether lice or mites are present; Eyelid biopsy: Doctors rarely recommend an eye biopsy unless skin cancer is suspected or abnormal cells are present. First, the doctor anesthetizes the eyelid locally, then uses a needle to take cell samples and examine the skin under a microscope. After the biopsy sample is taken, the eye may bruise but there will be no scarring.\n\nHow to treat upper eyelid blepharitis\n1. Clean your eyelids\nCleaning the eyelids helps wash away dirty fluids and accumulated pus that cause disease and prevents bacteria from entering and causing more serious infections. At home, the patient uses gauze moistened with warm water and applies it to the eye for 10 minutes or rinses with physiological saline. Then, clean off the scales on the eyelids and eyelashes and rinse with clean water.\n2. Antibiotic ointment\nSome popular antibiotic ointments to treat upper blepharitis such as Erythromycin, Bacitracin and Polysporin help kill bacteria and reduce irritation.\n3. Eye drops\nCyclosporine eye drops (Restoration) are prescribed by doctors to treat posterior blepharitis. This medication reduces inflammation and suppresses the body's natural immune response.\nDuring the treatment of upper blepharitis at home, the following should be noted:\nAvoid eye makeup: To reduce irritation, avoid eye makeup until inflammation is under control; Warm compress: Take a clean towel, wet it with warm water, wring it dry and place it on the eyelid until the temperature drops. Finally, use a clean towel to wipe away dirt and fluids on the eyelids.; Omega-3 supplements: Some studies show that omega-3 helps the glands in the eyes work better. Omega-3 is found in foods: salmon, mackerel, herring, oysters, flaxseed,...; Eye Exfoliation: Helps reduce dandruff on eyelashes and the amount of bacteria on eyelid skin.\n\nHow to prevent upper eyelid blepharitis\nTo prevent upper blepharitis, maintaining eye hygiene is a top priority. Clean eyes help prevent blockage of mebomian glands and remove sebum and dead skin. Each person should practice some of the following habits to prevent upper eyelid blepharitis [3]:\n1. Remove makeup thoroughly\nWhen applying makeup, the eyes are usually the highlight, so it is necessary to use a variety of powders, eyeliner, mascara, etc. Therefore, makeup must be removed thoroughly and avoid makeup falling into the eyes. In addition, people with upper blepharitis should not wear makeup in the eye area even if symptoms have improved. Even with successful treatment, upper blepharitis can recur, so it is important to maintain a daily eye hygiene routine.\n2. Clean hands, face and scalp\nKeep your eyelids, skin and hair clean, helping to control symptoms of upper blepharitis. People should clean their eyes every day with clean water and wash their hair with antibacterial shampoo. Additionally, combine some disinfectant sprays on the skin to prevent bacteria from growing.\nTreat upper blepharitis with eye drops\n3. Avoid touching your eyes\nHands that perform many activities during the day such as holding, grasping, etc. can easily accumulate bacteria, so you should not rub your eyes. When your eyes feel itchy or uncomfortable, wash your hands thoroughly with soap before touching your eyes. After washing your hands, carefully rinse your eyelids and eyelashes and use a dry towel to wipe your eyes.\nFor people who have blepharitis, they should keep their hands clean and limit rubbing their eyes to prevent it from getting worse.\n4. Use eye drops\nDuring treatment of upper blepharitis, patients can use artificial tears to help reduce dry eye symptoms. Artificial tears contain 0.18% sodium hyaluronate, which has been shown to be effective in treating dry eyes.\n5. Limit contact lenses\nWearing contact lenses affects the circulation and exchange of the tear film between the lens and the corneal surface. In particular, with soft contact lenses, because they have a certain hydration rate, if worn regularly, they will cause dry eyes. Patients will have symptoms such as burning, glare, and watery eyes.\nTherefore, contact lens users should see an ophthalmologist for examination and advice on choosing the right medication for the type of contact lenses they are wearing.\nIf there are signs of mild dry eyes, it is necessary to change to contact lenses from another material (hard contact lenses or soft contact lenses with low hydration) and reduce the time of wearing glasses, supplementing with artificial tears.\nIn addition, storing contact lenses without ensuring hygiene leads to the invasion of pathogens with symptoms such as red eyes, scratches, discharge from the eyes... even pain and blurred vision.\nOphthalmology Department, Tam Anh General Hospital System has a team of doctors and nurses with high expertise and many years of experience in treating eye diseases. And the system of modern machinery and equipment helps improve the condition of upper eyelid blepharitis effectively.\nBlepharitis on the eye does not cause permanent corneal damage but causes pain and discomfort for the patient and is easy to recur. Therefore, as soon as you detect unusual signs in your eyes such as swelling, redness, etc., you should immediately go to a hospital where there is an Eye specialist for timely examination, diagnosis and treatment.",
