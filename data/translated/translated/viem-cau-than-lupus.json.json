    "content": "Lupus glomerulonephritis: Causes, symptoms and treatment\n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus is a typical autoimmune disease that can cause complications in the kidneys, so it is also called lupus glomerulonephritis. Glomerulonephritis, if not well controlled, can lead to kidney failure.\n\nWhat is Lupus Glomerulonephritis?\nLupus glomerulonephritis is an inflammation of the kidneys caused by systemic lupus erythematosus. Lupus is an autoimmune disease. In people with this disease, instead of attacking agents that harm the body, the immune system attacks healthy tissues and organs, including the kidneys.\nThis causes kidney inflammation and can lead to blood in the urine, protein in the urine, high blood pressure, decreased kidney function or even kidney failure. About 60% of people with systemic lupus erythematosus develop glomerulonephritis. (first)\nIn 2003, the International Society of Nephrology and the Society of Renal Pathology divided lupus nephritis into 6 stages, including:\nStage I: Mild glomerular damage, the patient has no clinical manifestations, urine tests and kidney function are normal.; Stage II: Lupus mesangial glomerulonephritis. At this time, kidney damage begins to become more obvious with symptoms such as blood in the urine, possibly accompanied by low proteinuria, and more rarely, nephrotic syndrome.; Stage III: Localized proliferative glomerulonephritis. The blood vessels that feed the kidneys are damaged, some patients in this group have impaired kidney function and about 1⁄3 cases have nephrotic syndrome. Increased protein in blood and urine; Stage IV: Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis. At this time, more than 50% of important blood vessels in the kidney are damaged, the patient has nephrotic syndrome, accompanied by decreased kidney function.; Stage V: Membranous glomerulonephritis has the most common clinical manifestation of nephrotic syndrome. At this time, the patient may be prescribed dialysis or a kidney transplant.; Stage VI: Glomerulosclerosis is common in people who have had nephritis several years ago. Clinical manifestations include kidney failure, high blood pressure, and nephrotic syndrome. More than 90% of important blood vessels in the kidneys lose their ability to function.\n\nCauses of lupus nephritis\nFor every 10,000 people in the world, 3 people suffer from this disease. Lupus nephritis is more common in women than men, between the ages of 20 and 40. (2)\nThe main cause of lupus nephritis is systemic lupus erythematosus. In addition, a number of factors can increase the risk of disease, including: genetics, gender, environmental factors such as tobacco, shingles virus, stress...\n\nCommon symptoms\nAlthough lupus nephritis is a serious problem, symptoms are often nonspecific, such as swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet; or less common such as facial edema, arm edema. Different people may have different symptoms, but in general they include:\nWeight gain; High Blood Pressure; Dark urine; Foaming or blood in urine; Increased need to urinate, especially at night\nIn addition, because disease symptoms do not appear frequently and tend to be intermittent, kidney damage is detected mainly through urine test results.\nIt should be noted that not all urinary problems in people with systemic lupus erythematosus are signs of lupus glomerulonephritis. Sometimes, it can be a sign of a urinary tract infection.\n\nHow is Lupus Nephritis Diagnosed?\nDiagnosis of lupus glomerulonephritis will begin with a medical history, physical examination, and assessment of symptoms. After that, the doctor will prescribe necessary tests or diagnostic imaging, including:\n1. Blood and urine tests\nBlood tests to assess the concentration of waste products such as creatinine and urea; Collect 24-hour urine to measure the kidney's ability to filter waste and determine protein concentration in urine; Urine tests to check kidney function, measuring protein levels, red blood cells and white blood cells; The Iothalamate clearance test is performed by injecting radioactive Iothalamate into the patient's blood, then testing the rate at which the substance is filtered from the blood and excreted in the urine.\n2. Kidney biopsy\nA biopsy is the most accurate way to diagnose kidney disease. The doctor will insert a long needle through the patient's abdomen and into the kidney, then take a sample of kidney tissue to analyze for signs of damage. Through the biopsy results, the doctor will determine the stage of the disease and provide appropriate treatment.\n3. Ultrasound\nDuring an ultrasound, sound waves will be used to create detailed images of the patient's kidneys. The doctor will rely on these images to detect kidney abnormalities such as shape, size, etc.\n\nRisk of complications of Lupus nephritis\nDialysis patients at the Department of Artificial Nephrology - Urology and Nephrology Center - Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City\nThe most serious complication of lupus nephritis is permanent kidney damage, which reduces kidney function, causing chronic kidney disease or kidney failure. At this time, to maintain kidney function, the patient may need dialysis or a kidney transplant. (3)\nDialysis process at the Center for Urology and Nephrology - Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City is equipped with a new generation dialysis machine, which automatically checks the quality of the filter after each dialysis session, without needing to take the patient's blood for testing. , limiting blood loss and reducing costs for patients.\nAlthough lupus nephritis is a dangerous disease, in most cases, the disease will not develop into kidney failure if the patient follows the doctor's instructions.\n\nLupus glomerulonephritis treatment method\nCurrently, medicine still cannot completely cure lupus nephritis. Treatments are only aimed at reducing symptoms, slowing the progression of the disease, and reducing the risk of dialysis and kidney transplantation. Depending on each specific medical condition, the doctor will prescribe the following medications:\nCorticosteroids help reduce inflammation and are often prescribed until the inflammation improves. However, this medicine can cause serious side effects, so patients need to follow their doctor's instructions.; Immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, voclosporin, mycophenolate... have the ability to inhibit the activity of the immune system, causing damage to the kidneys.; Medications to control blood pressure such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). These medications also prevent protein from leaking from the kidneys into the urine.; It helps prevent blood clots from forming if necessary.\nEven with treatment, loss of kidney function can continue to develop. If drug treatment is no longer as effective as expected, the patient will need dialysis. Dialysis helps remove fluid and waste from the body, maintain a balance of minerals in the blood, and control blood pressure.\nThe ultimate treatment for lupus kidney disease is a kidney transplant.\n\nCaring for sick people at home\nTo achieve better treatment results, in addition to complying with the doctor's instructions, patients should practice some healthy living habits as follows:\nMake sure to provide enough water for the body; Follow a low-salt diet to maintain healthy blood pressure; In the daily menu, it is necessary to limit potassium, phosphorus, protein and cholesterol if kidney function has decreased; Use medication as prescribed by your doctor; Do not smoke and drink alcohol; Exercise regularly.\nCenter for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts, Internal Medicine and Surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nThe Center's experts and doctors are always confident in mastering the latest techniques, early detecting and effectively treating kidney and urinary tract diseases, helping patients shorten hospital stays and limit risk of recurrence, improving quality of life.\nWith the leading modern machinery and equipment system in the country and the region; Operating room meets international standards; Along with a 5-star boarding area and high-class service... The Urology and Nephrology Center stands out with examination, screening and treatment services for all urinary tract diseases. From common surgeries to major high-tech surgeries.\nThese include laparoscopic kidney stone surgery, kidney transplant, tumor resection to preserve kidney parenchyma; Radical nephrectomy; Radical prostatectomy; total bladder resection and small bowel cystoplasty; adrenalectomy; shaping urinary tract defects... Diagnosis - medical and surgical treatment of all diseases.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Center for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology - Urology, Tam Anh General Hospital System, you can make an appointment online through the following ways:\nCall the hotline 0287 102 6789 - 093 180 6858 or 024 3872 3872 - 024 7106 6858 (Hanoi) to register for a private medical appointment with a specialist, through the customer service staff.; Register for a medical appointment with any doctor you trust at the link: https://tamanhhospital.vn/danh-cho-khach-hang/dat-lich-kham/; Send a message on Tam Anh General Hospital Fanpage or Tam Anh General Hospital Urology and Andrology Fanpage; Text message via Zalo OA of Tam Anh General Hospital.\nIn short, treatment methods and response capabilities are different for each patient. People with systemic lupus erythematosus need to pay attention to the symptoms of lupus glomerulonephritis to promptly notify the doctor of any abnormalities.",
