    "content": "Acute gastritis: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment\n\nAcute gastritis is a common medical condition that can occur in all subjects, genders and ages. Symptoms of the disease appear suddenly, causing pain and discomfort, directly affecting daily activities. In the long term, if inflammation is not diagnosed or treated early, it can lead to many dangerous complications, seriously threatening your health.\n\nWhat is acute gastritis?\nAcute gastritis is a condition in which the stomach lining suddenly becomes inflamed or irritated, causing severe and persistent pain. Specifically, in this case, the organ activated an immune response, attracting white blood cells to the site of damage, causing inflammation. The higher the severity, the more likely acute gastritis will progress to an erosive state, creating ulcers and small areas of bleeding within the mucosa.\nThe disease can appear at any age, but is most common in middle-aged and elderly people. Inflammation comes from many different causes, possibly due to injury, bacteria, virus invasion, stress or diet...(1)\n\nSymptoms of acute gastritis\nSome cases of acute gastritis do not present with obvious symptoms. However, in general, patients can be detected through the following common signs:\nStomach pain or discomfort; Heartburn.; Loss of appetite; Nausea, vomiting; Vomiting blood (occurs when inflammation leads to tears or the formation of deep ulcers in the stomach lining).; Abnormal weight loss.; Fever.; Unusual feeling of fullness in the stomach; Feeling full too quickly after eating; Passing black stools.\n\nCauses of acute gastritis\nAcute gastritis comes from many different causes, typically including:\n1. Microbial infection\nThe invasion and growth of Helicobacter Pylori bacteria is one of the common causes of acute gastritis, specifically accounting for ⅔ of the world's population. In addition, other types of bacteria, viruses, fungi... are also agents but do not account for a high proportion.\n2. React against irritants\nBile reflux: Bile is naturally excreted into the small intestine to support digestion. If accidentally moved to the stomach, it will cause mucosal damage.; Alcohol consumption: Alcoholic beverages damage the stomach lining, leading to inflammation; Abuse of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Pain relievers, such as Aspirin, Ibuprofen... can increase acid levels in the stomach by inhibiting protective substances called Prostaglandins. Frequent abuse and high doses will lead to inflammation.; Iron: Iron has the potential to damage the stomach lining if taken on an empty stomach.\n3. Immune system disorders\nThis is a malfunction of the immune system, affecting the stomach lining cells. In the long term, this reaction will cause the stomach's protective barrier to be eroded. Accordingly, acute gastritis due to immune system disorders often occurs commonly in people with type 1 diabetes, Hashimoto's disease, Vitamin B12 deficiency...\n4. Blood vessel problems\nRare malformations of blood vessels or complications from chronic heart failure can also affect blood flow to the stomach. In some cases, this is the cause of acute gastritis.\n5. Ischemia\nWhen the blood supply to the stomach is insufficient, inflammation can occur. Some common causes include:\nCocaine drug abuse.; Severe dehydration.; Sepsis.; Severe injury or burns.\n6. Food allergies or poisoning\nFood allergies in the stomach will cause white blood cell counts to increase, causing irritation and mucosal damage. This is also one of the common causes of acute gastritis.(2)\n7. Granulomatous disease\nAcute gastritis can be a complication of granulomatous disease. This medical condition affects the body's immune system, damaging the stomach.\n\nWho is at risk for acute gastritis?\nAcute gastritis can happen to anyone, of any age, gender... However, people in the at-risk group tend to be more susceptible, including:\nUse of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).; Corticosteroid use.; Drink a lot of alcohol.; Undergone major surgery.; Patients have kidney failure, liver failure, and respiratory failure.\n\nHow is acute gastritis diagnosed?\nFor acute gastritis, the doctor may first ask some questions related to symptoms, pain level, medical history... to find out details. Then diagnostic methods will be performed to reach the most accurate conclusions, including:\nComplete blood count (CBC) test: Test performed to check overall health.; Breath and saliva tests: Purpose to check for the existence of Helicobacter Pylori bacteria; Stool test: Purpose to check for blood in the stool.; Gastroesophageal endoscopy: Purpose to examine the stomach lining; Stomach tissue biopsy: A small sample of stomach tissue is removed for pathology (examination under a microscope).; X-ray: This method can be performed to check for problems related to the structure of the digestive system.\n\nAre complications of acute gastritis dangerous?\nAcute gastritis, if not treated promptly, can lead to ulcers or bleeding. In addition, in a few cases, the disease also increases the risk of stomach cancer, especially when the mucosa layer is thin.\n\nHow to treat acute gastritis\nDepending on the severity of the disease, the doctor will prescribe different treatment methods for acute gastritis.\nSpecifically includes:\n1. Use medication\nMedicines to treat acute gastritis include both prescription and non-prescription types. Normally, your doctor may prescribe a combination of drugs to ensure the best results, including:\nAntacids (aluminum phosphalugel or magnesium hydroxide): This type is used to neutralize stomach acid. In case of necessity, the doctor may prescribe a dose to take several times a day.; H2 antagonists (Famotidine (Pepcid), Cimetidine (Tagamet)...): This type is used to reduce stomach acid secretion, can be taken 10 - 60 minutes before eating or before going to bed.; Proton pump inhibitors (Omeprazole (Prilosec), Esomeprazole (Nexium)…): Drugs that inhibit stomach acid production, should only be used every 24 hours and usually taken 30 – 60 minutes before meals.; Antibiotics for infections caused by Helicobacter Pylori bacteria: Amoxicillin, Tetracycline (should not be used in children under 12 years old) and Clarithromycin.\nAntibiotics can be used at the same time as antacids, H2 antagonists, and Proton pump inhibitors. Treatment usually lasts from 10 to 28 days. However, in all cases, patients need to discuss carefully with their doctors about medication use to minimize unwanted problems.(3)\n2. Change your lifestyle\nChanging daily living habits in a healthy, balanced way can also contribute to improving acute gastritis. Some useful solutions include:\nLimit alcohol consumption as much as possible; Quit smoking.; Control emotions, avoid stress; Lose weight if your body is overweight.\n3. Change your diet\nTo reduce symptoms of acute gastritis, patients should pay attention to their daily diet:\nAvoid foods that contain a lot of spices, grease, sour, and hot foods because they can easily irritate the stomach.; Divide meals into smaller portions throughout the day.; Actively supplement foods that are good for the stomach: bananas, coconut water, yogurt, vegetables, ginger, cereals...\n\nMethods to prevent acute gastritis\nAlways wash your hands with antibacterial soap before eating to reduce the risk of Helicobacter Pylori infection; Eat cooked food and drink boiled food to avoid the risk of infection.; Avoid or limit drinking alcohol as much as possible; Regularly wash your hands with soap and water before meals. This may reduce your risk of getting infected with H. pylori.; Cook food thoroughly. This also reduces the risk of infection.; Avoid drinking alcohol or limit alcohol intake.; Avoid using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) regularly.\n\nQuestions about acute gastritis\n1. How long does acute gastritis last?\nThe duration of acute gastritis depends on the cause of the disease, the time of initiation of treatment and the therapy. Usually, symptoms will show signs of improvement within a few days to a few weeks if the condition has not progressed to a serious level.(4)\n2. What should you eat if you have acute gastritis?\nFiber-rich food group: whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans...; Low-fat food group: Vegetables, lean meat, fish...; Food groups with low acidity: Vegetables, beans.; The drink does not contain gas, caffeine, or alcohol; Food groups containing Probiotics that are beneficial for health: kimchi, yogurt, kombucha...\n3. Is acute gastritis contagious?\nAcute gastritis is infectious if the cause is Helicobacter Pylori bacteria. Common ways of transmission include:\nSwimming in rivers, streams, swimming pools; Eating uncooked foods; The family has a relative who is sick and lives together.\nContact with an infected person's saliva has not yet been proven to be a route of transmission. However, in all cases, self-protection is still necessary.\nCenter for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City) and Department of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreatic (Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing High-class, effective examination and treatment services for patients with mild to severe liver problems (fatty liver, acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer...). Tam Anh General Hospital system brings together a team of highly specialized and experienced Internal Medicine - Surgery - Gastrointestinal Endoscopy doctors, in addition to the support of a modern medical equipment system imported from abroad. in addition, serving the maximum examination and treatment needs of customers.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of liver diseases with gastroenterology specialists of Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nAbove is a summary of all information related to acute gastritis. Hopefully with these shares, patients will have more useful updates to prevent, detect and treat the disease effectively.",
