    "content": "Gastritis: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment\n\nGastritis is a digestive disease caused by damage to the lining of the stomach. The disease causes pain in the epigastric area for patients. Gastritis can occur in all ages and subjects. Furthermore, gastroenteritis can cause precancerous lesions in the stomach. Therefore, you need to understand the symptoms and treatment of gastroduodenal inflammation to optimally prevent the disease.\n\nWhat is duodenal gastritis?\nGastritis is an inflammation of the gastric mucosa, characterized by the infiltration of inflammatory cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, etc. This is a common lesion in all subjects. At any age, the majority of patients with duodenal gastritis have no symptoms but mainly have symptoms due to acute inflammation. Possible symptoms: pain in the epigastric area when hungry or after eating, feeling full quickly, and discomfort in the epigastric area after eating.\nIn addition, gastroduodenal inflammation is also recognized through other symptoms such as epigastric burning, belching, heartburn and bloating.(1)\n1. Acute gastroduodenal inflammation\nGastroduodenal inflammation is diagnosed as acute gastroduodenal inflammation when the stomach mucosa is exposed to toxins, leading to congestive and hemorrhagic lesions on the mucosal wall. These harmful toxins often appear in non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, alcohol, bile acids, etc.\nBesides, acute gastroduodenal inflammation can also come from reduced blood perfusion in the stomach. The condition occurs in subjects with trauma, burns, hypothermia, sepsis, or people undergoing radiation therapy for cancer and systemic chemotherapy.\nPeople with acute gastroduodenal inflammation will usually develop symptoms quickly with a rapid progression. This is also the level at which the disease can be completely treated with medication.(2)\n2. Chronic duodenal gastritis\nChronic gastritis is the result of long-term inflammation. Chronic gastric mucosal lesions can be diffuse or localized in one area of ​​the gastric mucosa. There are 3 types of chronic gastroduodenal inflammation:\nAtrophic gastric mucosa type B: is a common type, caused by Helicobacter Pylori bacteria, the initial atrophic inflammation in the antrum gradually spreads to the upper part of the stomach. Most bacterial atrophic mucosal thickening caused by H.P. is often silent and has no symptoms; Atrophic gastric mucosa type B: is a common type, caused by Helicobacter Pylori bacteria, the initial atrophic inflammation in the antrum gradually spreads to the upper part of the stomach. Most bacterial atrophic mucosal inflammation caused by H.P is often silent and has no symptoms.\nAtrophic gastric mucosa type A: less common, autoimmune cause, the body produces antibodies against its own gastric mucosa, atrophic inflammatory lesions spread from the gastric corpus bulge down in the opposite direction of atrophic gastritis gastric mucosa type B.; Atrophic gastric mucosa type A: less common, autoimmune cause, the body produces antibodies against its own gastric mucosa, atrophic inflammatory lesions spread from the gastric corpus bulge down in the opposite direction of atrophic gastritis type B gastric mucosa.\nSpecial forms of gastroduodenal inflammation: Chemical (bile, anti-inflammatory steroids), lymphocytic gastritis, erosive gastritis, eosinophilic gastritis, infectious gastritis ( Bacteria, viruses, parasites), gastritis due to Crohn's disease...; Special forms of gastroduodenal inflammation: Chemical (bile, anti-inflammatory steroids), lymphocytic gastritis, erosive gastritis, eosinophilic gastritis, infectious gastritis ( Bacteria, viruses, parasites), gastritis due to Crohn's disease....\n\nCauses of duodenal gastritis\n1. Helicobacter Pylori infection\nHelicobacter Pylori infection is considered the leading cause of chronic atrophic gastritis. Helicobacter Pylori (H.P), is a type of bacillus that can live in the acidic environment of the stomach, causing long-term inflammation of the gastric mucosa leading to atrophy of the mucosal glands.\nAccording to statistics, 60% - 80% of Vietnamese people are infected with H.P. bacteria. This bacteria can enter humans through contaminated water or food. Besides, people living in unhygienic environments also have a high risk of being infected with HP bacteria and suffering from inflammation of the stomach lining. (3)\n2. Eating habits\nEating habits are one of the leading factors that directly affect the health of the digestive system. Because of its close connection with the digestive process, frequency of contractions and acid secretion of the stomach, unscientific eating habits will increase your risk of duodenal gastritis. Eating a lot of spices can strongly irritate the stomach lining.\nActivities such as skipping breakfast, not eating at the right time or having a specific time can increase the risk of gastroduodenal inflammation or recurrence of the disease more than others.\n2. Unhealthy lifestyle\nUnhealthy lifestyle negatively impacts many aspects of a patient's health. This is not the direct cause of gastroduodenal inflammation, but the integrated consequences of unhealthy lifestyle activities will lead to gastroduodenal inflammation.\nAlcohol abuse: Alcohol or alcoholic drinks have the ability to increase acid secretion in the stomach, causing direct damage to the stomach lining.\n\nComplications of duodenal gastritis\n1. Gastrointestinal bleeding\nAcute gastroduodenal inflammation can cause stomach bleeding.\n2. Stomach cancer\nNot everyone is infected with H.P bacteria for a long time, leading to atrophic inflammation of the gastric mucosa and leading to stomach cancer. Path to gastric cancer: atrophic mucosal inflammation, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, early gastric cancer, advanced gastric cancer (late gastric cancer). Therefore, people with atrophic gastric mucosal lesions and intestinal metaplasia need to have regular endoscopy every 1-3 years depending on the severity of the lesion to be able to detect pre-cancer or cancer early. stomach\n\nTreatment of duodenal gastritis\nMost gastric mucosal inflammation has no symptoms, only treatment when symptoms occur or treatment to kill H.P when symptoms occur.\nDepending on the reason for gastroduodenal inflammation as well as each person's symptoms, the doctor will prescribe different treatment methods. In order to optimize the treatment regimen, the doctor will review the patient's medical history in addition to clinical and paraclinical diagnosis of gastroduodenal inflammation.\nSome common methods of treating duodenal gastritis:\nTreatment of gastroduodenal inflammation with antibiotics: Applicable to subjects infected with HP bacteria. The duration of antibiotic treatment may be two weeks in conjunction with acid suppression.; Treatment of gastroduodenal inflammation with antibiotics: Applicable to subjects infected with HP bacteria. The duration of antibiotic treatment may be two weeks in conjunction with acid suppression.\nTreatment of gastroduodenal inflammation by reducing acid secretion: Drugs such as proton pump inhibitors that can reduce the amount of acid secreted in the stomach: esoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole.; Treatment of gastroduodenal inflammation by reducing acid secretion: Medicines such as proton pump inhibitors that can reduce the amount of acid secreted in the stomach: esoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole.\n\nPrevention of duodenal gastritis\nThe best way to prevent gastroduodenal inflammation is to take good care of digestive health. Some effective, easy-to-implement disease prevention methods help you reduce the possibility of gastroduodenal inflammation:\nMaintain cleanliness to limit bacteria from entering the body through the mouth; Scientific diet with suitable nutrition for the body; Do not abuse stimulants; Limit hot, spicy and greasy foods\nCenter for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City) and Department of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreatic (Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing High-class, effective examination and treatment services for patients with stomach, digestive tract, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic diseases. Tam Anh General Hospital system brings together a team of highly specialized and experienced Internal Medicine - Surgery - Gastrointestinal Endoscopy doctors, in addition to the support of a modern medical equipment system imported from abroad. in addition, serving the maximum examination and treatment needs of customers.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of liver diseases with gastroenterology specialists of Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nGastroduodenal inflammation is a fairly common condition that can be detected on endoscopy due to symptoms during a medical examination or without symptoms during a routine endoscopy. It can happen to anyone. any age. Acute gastroduodenal inflammation is not too dangerous and can be treated completely with acid-reducing drugs. However, chronic gastritis has the potential to increase the risk of developing stomach cancer. Because chronic gastritis cannot be completely treated, patients need to take preventative measures to minimize the risk with a healthy lifestyle, appropriate diet and periodic endoscopy. thick.",
