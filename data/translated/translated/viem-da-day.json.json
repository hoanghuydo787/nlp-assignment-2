    "content": "Gastritis: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis and prevention\n\nGastritis is the cause of pain, heat in the epigastric area, frequent belching, heartburn, and stomach bleeding in severe cases. Acute gastritis is basically a disease that can be completely treated with simple medical methods. However, chronic gastritis is difficult to completely cure.\n\nWhat is gastritis?\nGastritis, also known as inflammation of the gastric mucosa, is a typical digestive health disease. The disease is a condition in which the mucosal surface is damaged or eroded by bacteria or other agents. Gastritis is characterized by the infiltration of inflammatory cells, so doctors need the results of gastric histopathology tests to diagnose and conclude the disease.\nThe gastric mucosa is a thin layer that functions to protect the stomach wall from the irritating effects of acid or bacterial attacks. According to the pathogenesis of gastritis, when the gastric mucosa is attacked by bacteria from the outside, the gastric mucosa will be damaged, with a high possibility of developing gastric ulcers. In addition, the mucosa can also be damaged by abnormal acid secretion inside the body. This is a consequence of irregular eating habits and a prolonged unhealthy diet.(1)\nThe disease has two types: acute gastritis and chronic gastritis, often accompanied by clinical symptoms of the intestines, digestive system and abnormal stomach.\n1. Acute gastritis\nAcute gastritis is an acute inflammation of the stomach due to many reasons: drugs, alcohol, etc. Patients will often recognize acute gastritis as soon as symptoms appear.\nThe main symptoms are epigastric pain, causing discomfort during eating activities. These are typical clinical symptoms of the disease and will go away on their own after a short time, ranging from 5 to 7 days.\nPeople with acute gastritis may not need treatment, they just need to change their diet to minimize and support the stomach to recover from damage.\n2. Chronic gastritis\nChronic gastritis occurs mostly due to HP bacteria. It is unclear when the disease started. The disease often has no symptoms, mainly detected during stomach endoscopy. Chronic gastritis can progress to atrophic inflammation, intestinal metaplasia, and develop precancerous lesions of the stomach as well as increase the risk of stomach cancer for the patient.\n\nSubjects susceptible to disease\nAcute gastritis can occur in any person and at any age. However, this is not a common or easily contracted disease. You can completely prevent acute gastritis by following a scientific diet and healthy lifestyle.(2)\nOn the other hand, gastritis can also easily appear in certain subjects. These subjects include people living in unsanitary environments, thereby increasing the possibility of being infected with H.pylori bacteria, a type of bacteria that causes gastritis.\nIn addition, older people are also considered to be at higher risk of gastritis than young people because of long-term HP infection. Furthermore, older people are also a group of people who use a lot of anti-inflammatory pain relievers (NSAIDS). This is also the reason why the mucosa in the elderly is at high risk of damage due to long-term use of NSAIDs.\n\nSymptoms of gastritis\nThe most typical symptom of gastritis is epigastric pain. In addition, the disease also causes nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal discomfort and heartburn and belching.\nSome signs of gastritis that can identify the disease include:\nAbdominal pain in the epigastric area, which can be severe when hungry or after eating or both; Feeling bloated and bloated after eating, so I can't eat as much as usual; Gas, belching, heartburn; Anorexia; Nausea and vomiting\nIt should be noted that these symptoms are similar to other digestive diseases such as gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcers or even stomach cancer. Therefore, when patients experience the above symptoms, they need to go to the hospital immediately for in-depth diagnosis and diagnosis. The examination will help patients receive a treatment regimen appropriate to their health condition and disease. From there, restore stomach function and heal damage.\n\nCauses of acute gastritis\nMedication: Aspirin, anti-inflammatory pain relievers (NSAIDS); Alcohol; Due to Helicobacter Pylori (H.P) bacteria (3); Due to stress, severe trauma, burns, sepsis...\n\nCauses of chronic gastritis\nThe most common is Helicobacter Pylori infection; Rare causes: autoimmune, Crohn's disease...\n\nHow to diagnose gastritis\nDefinite diagnosis is the diagnosis of the cause of gastritis in a patient. The doctor will ask the patient a number of questions related to symptoms and eating habits in the near and long term to understand the patient's situation. Endoscopy is the best diagnostic method, helping to differentiate from other stomach diseases, especially stomach cancer.\nEndoscopy of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. In this method, the doctor will insert an endoscope with a specialized camera into the patient's stomach. The camera will record and display inflammation and swelling of the stomach lining. When it is necessary to do a diagnostic test for HP, the doctor will take a sample of stomach mucosa tissue for testing.(5)\nIn some necessary cases, usually cases of suspected pre-cancer, the doctor will also ask the patient to perform a stomach biopsy to rule out some related diseases. A biopsy may be performed during an endoscopy, where the doctor will take a sample of stomach lining tissue and test it.\n\nWhen do you need to see a doctor?\nAcute gastritis can go away on its own without treatment, or with treatment to reduce acid secretion. Although acute gastritis is not a dangerous disease, it can also cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Therefore, seeing a doctor is necessary when symptoms do not improve after adjusting diet and lifestyle\n\nComplications of gastritis\n1. Is gastritis contagious?\nGastritis is not inherently contagious. However, for people with gastritis caused by H.pylori bacterial infection, infection is possible.\nIt should be noted that the infection here is infection with H.pylori bacteria through food and drink. This is the most common type of bacteria that causes gastritis, so when this bacteria is transmitted from person to person, it can easily cause gastritis.\n2. Is gastritis dangerous?\nAcute gastritis is not a dangerous disease. On the other hand, gastritis can be completely treated medically by taking it orally. However, it can cause gastrointestinal bleeding: vomiting blood, black stools, anemia...\nChronic gastritis is also a cause of atrophy of the gastric mucosa leading to intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and, most seriously, stomach cancer.\n\nTreatment of gastritis\nTreatment of gastritis is mainly acute gastritis, medical treatment with oral medications. Depending on each clinical symptom, the doctor will prescribe appropriate medications for each case. Common medications used to treat gastritis include:\nAntibiotics: Treatment for cases of gastritis caused by HP bacteria (4); Acid neutralizing medication: This medication has the effect of reducing acid exposure to the mucosa and stomach wall.; Limiting inflammation quickly relieves unpleasant symptoms; Proton pump inhibitors: these are acid-reducing drugs that help control and reduce the amount of acid the stomach produces; Indicated for cases of acute gastritis; Chronic gastritis often has no symptoms. If it is caused by HP, drugs can be used to kill HP bacteria.\n\nHow to prevent gastritis?\nDo not abuse or limit alcohol; Always use NSAID pain relievers as prescribed by your doctor. Do not use these drugs arbitrarily.; Limit foods that are too spicy; Pay attention to hygiene when eating and drinking\nCenter for Endoscopy and Gastrointestinal Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City) and Department of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreatic (Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing High-class, effective examination and treatment services for patients with gastrointestinal diseases: such as gastritis, stomach ulcers... mild to severe liver problems (fatty liver, acute hepatitis, chronic, cirrhosis, liver cancer...). Tam Anh General Hospital system brings together a team of highly specialized and experienced Internal Medicine - Surgery - Gastrointestinal Endoscopy doctors, in addition to the support of a modern medical equipment system imported from abroad. in addition, serving the maximum examination and treatment needs of customers.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of liver diseases with gastroenterology specialists of Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nGastritis is one of the common digestive diseases. The disease is often caused by infection with H.Pylori bacteria or irregular eating and unscientific nutrition. People with gastritis will have symptoms of epigastric pain, heartburn, belching and abdominal bloating. The disease can be completely treated with medication, the treatment regimen is short and not too complicated. However, patients need to pay attention to good digestive health to minimize the risk of complications or chronic gastritis.",
