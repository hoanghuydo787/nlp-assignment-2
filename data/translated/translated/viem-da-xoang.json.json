    "content": "Polysinusitis: Causes, symptoms and treatment\n\nPolysinusitis is a common ear, nose and throat disease, causing unpleasant symptoms in the sinus area, but sometimes severe complications can occur, causing blindness or life-threatening conditions when there are intracranial complications such as meningitis. brain, brain abscess.\nPolysinusitis is an inflammation of 2 or more sinuses\n\nWhat disease is polysinusitis?\nThe sinus system includes sinuses on both sides: jaw, ethmoid, frontal, sphenoid. Polysinusitis is an inflammation and swelling of the epithelial mucosa lining the sinuses and at least two or more sinuses are inflamed. Polysinusitis occurs due to an inflammatory reaction, allergy or infection caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi.\n\nClassification of polysinusitis\nAccording to MSc.BSc.CKI Ho Van Huu - Doctor of Ear, Nose and Throat Department, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, based on the duration of symptoms, polysinusitis is classified into the following types:\nAcute polysinusitis: Can completely heal in <4 weeks; Subacute polysinusitis: Can completely resolve in 4-8 weeks.; Chronic polysinusitis: Disease lasts >12 weeks; Recurrent sinusitis: Inflammation with ≥4 scattered acute episodes per year, each episode completely resolves in <4 weeks but recurs periodically, at least 10 days from the end of symptoms to the beginning of a new episode.\n\nCauses of polysinusitis\nEach type of sinusitis can be caused by different causes. Therefore, classifying sinusitis can help find the cause of the disease.\n1. Causes of acute sinusitis\nAcute polysinusitis requires identifying the infectious agent to use appropriate antibiotics to avoid antibiotic resistance. Acute polysinusitis is mostly caused by viral agents, commonly viruses such as rhinovirus (virus that causes colds), influenza, parainfluenza (virus that causes upper respiratory tract infections). A small percentage of polysinusitis is caused by a bacterial infection or develops a secondary bacterial infection. Bacteria that often cause acute polysinusitis include pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, staphylococcus or anaerobic bacteria when the infection originates from the oral area.\nAcute fungal sinusitis often occurs in patients with weakened immune systems, such as diabetes, HIV, cancer, etc. (1)\n2. Causes of chronic sinusitis\nAccording to MSc.BSc.CKI Ho Van Huu, chronic polysinusitis is often caused by many combined pathogenesis factors. Patients may have co-morbidities or related risk factors such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, smoking, air pollution, structural abnormalities in the nasal sinuses, and systemic diseases affecting to the function of cilia in the nasal and sinus mucosa and oral infections.\n\nDiagnosis of polysinusitis\nMSc.BSc.CKI Ho Van Huu said that to diagnose polysinusitis, doctors will exploit symptoms, perform endoscopy and imaging methods.\n1. Exploit symptoms\nPatients present with nasal congestion, anterior or posterior rhinorrhea, facial headache, and reduced or loss of sense of smell. In children, it often presents with cough rather than olfactory discomfort. When the patient exhibits at least 2/4 of the above symptoms and has symptoms of nasal congestion or runny nose, the diagnosis is sinusitis.\nWhen acute polysinusitis occurs, clinical symptoms are often severe, and there may be accompanying systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, loss of appetite, fatigue...\nThe location of the patient's facial headache will suggest that the sinuses are inflamed:\nMaxillary sinusitis: patients often have pain in the cheek area. If accompanied by toothache, attention should be paid to maxillary sinusitis secondary to tooth root infection.; Frontal sinusitis: often pain in the frontal area; Sphenoid sinusitis: often pain in the occipital area behind the head and neck; Ethmoid sinusitis: usually the ethmoid sinus is located deep in the skull cavity, stretching from front to back, so pain symptoms are often vague\n2. Sinus endoscopy\nAcute polysinusitis often shows nasal mucosa congestion, edema, and mucus clouding the sinus openings. Meanwhile, chronic polysinusitis often shows mucosal swelling, degeneration, and possibly nasal polyps.\nSinus endoscopy is a routine test in the diagnosis of polysinusitis\n3. Diagnostic imaging\nThis is a diagnostic tool to help determine whether or not polysinusitis is present. Patients will be scanned with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the maxillofacial area.\n\nTreatment methods for polysinusitis\nMSc.BSc.CKI Ho Van Huu said that treatment methods for polysinusitis include medical treatment using medicine or surgery.\n1. Use medicine to treat polysinusitis\nMost acute polysinusitis will respond to medical treatment, including antibiotics, systemic or local anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-allergic drugs, and symptom-relieving drugs. Patients are often advised to drink plenty of water to thin mucus and use a nasal spray to aid in treatment, avoiding exposure to allergic or irritant factors: cold air, cigarette smoke, air. polluted…\n2. Surgery\nSurgery is indicated when polysinusitis has complications or chronic sinusitis does not respond to drug treatment. Surgery removes lesions and abnormal nasal structures that cause obstruction such as deviated septum and turbinate hypertrophy.\nSinus surgery at Tam Anh General Hospital is performed through nasal endoscopy using a German Karl Storz machine along with an American Medtronic cutting machine system. The surgeon will insert tiny endoscopic instruments into the patient's nose, then widen the sinus openings, cut polyps, remove fungal tissue, and remove mucus and pus, without causing damage to neighboring organs.\nWhen the surgery is over, the doctor can place sponges on both sides of the nose to help stabilize the incision and stop bleeding in place. The patient will be taken to the recovery room until he regains consciousness. When the patient is awake, he can breathe through his mouth and eat normally. The next day, take out the sponge and breathe through both noses. Usually patients are discharged after 2-3 days.\nPolysinusitis surgery is minimally invasive, recovers quickly, and minimizes the risk of complications during and after surgery at Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nHow to prevent polysinusitis\nTo prevent polysinusitis, Ho Van Huu, M.D., M.Sc., notes each person as follows:\nAvoid catching colds and or other infections;; Avoid contact with allergens such as pollen, animal hair... or irritants such as cigarette smoke...; Have a healthy diet with fresh vegetables and fruits rich in antioxidants;; Get a flu vaccine every year;; Wash your hands regularly to avoid infection;; Always keep your body warm, especially your ears, nose, and throat;; When suffering from acute flu and rhinitis, patients need to see a doctor to receive appropriate treatment to avoid subsequent polysinusitis;; Patients with allergic rhinitis or patients with diseases accompanying polysinusitis should see a doctor early and have their sinuses checked regularly.\nGetting vaccinated against seasonal flu every year is one of the ways to prevent complications that cause sinusitis.

Is polysinusitis dangerous?\nPolysinusitis is a common disease in the population, but if left untreated, complications can occur that affect health, leave sequelae or threaten the patient's life: encephalitis - meningitis, brain abscess, inflammation - orbital abscess, sepsis.\n2. Does polysinusitis cause headaches?\nPolysinusitis often presents with headaches. Inflammation of any single sinus can cause headaches and is even more serious when there is polysinusitis. Blockage of the sinuses leads to lack of oxygen to the brain, lack of brain oxygen will lead to headaches and fatigue.\n3. When does polysinusitis require immediate hospitalization?\nPatients need to be hospitalized immediately when complications are suspected. Suggested symptoms include severe headaches, continuous high fever, eye swelling or blurred vision. Patients need to be re-examined according to the doctor's appointment or re-examined immediately if symptoms suddenly worsen.\n4. How to use medicine to treat polysinusitis in children?\nPolysinusitis in children is often acute, so it is mainly treated with medication. It is important that the doctor needs to determine whether the agent is a virus or a bacteria to use appropriate antibiotic treatment. Although polysinusitis causing ocular and intracranial complications is rare in children, it can still occur, and these cases require prompt surgery and subsequent use of intravenous antibiotics.(2)\nPatients need to be examined and treated for polysinusitis by an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of sinusitis with Ear, Nose and Throat specialists, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nPolysinusitis is a common ear, nose and throat disease in the population. Inflammation of many sinuses at the same time can make the symptoms twice as severe. When suffering from polysinusitis, patients should see an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist for proper treatment. Avoid using unproven folk methods because they can cause more severe sinus infections.",
