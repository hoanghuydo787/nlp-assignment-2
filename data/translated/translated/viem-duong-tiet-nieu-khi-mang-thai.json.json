In there,\nUrinary tract infection during pregnancy is also one of the common diseases and needs to be recognized to have effective and timely treatment plans to avoid danger to mother and baby.\n\nWhat is urinary tract infection during pregnancy?\nUrinary tract infection during pregnancy is a condition in which any part of a pregnant woman's urinary system such as the kidneys, ureters, bladder... becomes infected. Although the disease is very common, the symptoms do not always appear clearly, so it is easy for pregnant women to not recognize it, leading to neglect or ineffective treatment, causing the disease to recur many times. .\nIf not treated promptly and properly, urinary tract infections during pregnancy can increase the risk of complications such as pyelonephritis in the mother, the risk of miscarriage, and premature birth; low birth weight babies, newborn infections...\nIn case of urinary infection, pregnant women will be prescribed antibiotics according to a specific treatment regimen, helping to ensure a safe pregnancy.

Besides, hormonal changes also make it easier for urine to reflux into the ureters, causing urinary tract infections.; From the 6th week of pregnancy onwards, the pregnant woman's ureter begins to expand until the day of giving birth. Urine is highly concentrated. Bladder volume increases, bladder tone decreases, and urine is difficult to empty. Bacteria have the ability to stay in the urinary tract for a long time, penetrating deeper up to the kidneys.; The increasing size of the fetus is also a cause of urinary tract infections in the mother. Because the fetus will put pressure on the urinary tract, especially the bladder, causing urine to easily leak, creating a humid environment for bacteria to multiply and develop quickly.; Improper hygiene or unsafe sex during pregnancy also causes Escherichia Coli bacteria and other bacteria in the anal area to attack the urinary tract.; Many women have group B streptococcus in their colon and vagina. During pregnancy, they will attack the urinary tract causing inflammation. Group B streptococcus can even be transmitted from mother to child during childbirth.\n\nIs urinary tract infection during pregnancy dangerous?\nAny infection during pregnancy can be dangerous for mother and fetus, and urinary tract infections are no exception.

It could be the risk of stillbirth, miscarriage, premature birth or neonatal infection... Among them, neonatal infection is a dangerous disease with a high risk of death. (2)\nSigns of urinary tract infection in pregnant women\nStatistics show that 2-10% of women suffer from urinary tract infections during pregnancy and the worrying thing is that this condition tends to recur frequently, especially for those who have had the disease before and the risk is also high. than for women with multiple births.
