    "content": "Postpartum urinary tract infection: Causes and effective treatments\n\nStatistics show that about 4.6% of women giving birth by cesarean section and 3.5% of women giving birth vaginally have to be treated for urinary tract infections after giving birth. To prevent this condition from affecting the health of mother and baby, you should have some knowledge available\ncure\n as well as effective measures to prevent disease.\n\nWhat is postpartum urinary tract infection?\nPostpartum urinary tract infection is a condition that usually occurs within a few days or weeks after giving birth. Due to the characteristics of the birth process, women who give birth by cesarean section are more at risk of urinary tract infections than women who give birth vaginally (normal birth).\nUrinary Tract Infection (UTI) is a condition in which parts of the urinary system (including the kidneys, ureters, and bladder) are attacked by bacteria, most typically E.Coli bacteria.\nUsually, UTIs will appear in the lower urinary tract (bladder, urethra). Bacteria can then follow the urethra and enter the kidneys, causing acute or chronic nephritis. In particular, due to the short structure of the urethra, women have a higher risk of urinary tract infections than men. (first)\n\nCauses of postpartum urinary tract infections\nAccording to Urology experts, Tam Anh General Hospital, many women suffer from urinary tract infections and the cause of this condition is due to:\nDuring labor, the pelvic floor muscles, ligaments, nerves, and lower abdominal muscles become overactive, leading to injuries that cause them to lose function. At this time, urine is easily lost, creating conditions for bacteria to multiply and enter the urinary tract, causing infection; Pregnancy and childbirth can also cause the bladder to lose its tone, causing fluid retention. This is an opportunity for urine to easily reflux into the ureters, remaining in this area for a long time, creating conditions for bacteria to multiply, increasing the risk of urinary tract infections during pregnancy.; The pressure of a baby being born vaginally can impact the bladder, leading to temporary paralysis. In case you have a cesarean section and have to undergo anesthesia, it reduces the flexibility of the bladder. In addition, swelling and pain in the perineum also affect the excretory function and make pregnant women susceptible to urinary tract infections.; If you have a catheter inserted during childbirth, rubbing or scratching the skin can easily cause infection because the area is often exposed to urine and bacteria from the anus.; Besides, psychological factors such as fear of pain or abstinence can prevent you from bathing and cleaning your private area regularly, causing bacteria to grow quickly.\n\nSymptoms of postpartum UTI\nIf you have a postpartum urinary tract infection, you will often have symptoms such as:\nPainful urination, painful urination; Feeling of heaviness and dull pain in the lower abdomen; Frequent urge to urinate, but urinating very little; Cloudy or foul-smelling urine\nBurning pain when urinating is very common when you have just given birth and will disappear in a short time without leaving any effects. If you gave birth vaginally, some sharp pain and painful urination may be due to a torn perineum and the perineum has not yet recovered. After about 2 weeks, the wound heals, health stabilizes, and the condition will improve. For women giving birth by cesarean section, pain in the urinary tract often comes from the catheter being inserted and also disappears after a few days of removing the catheter. (2)\nIf the burning pain or urination disorder does not improve but there are signs of aggravation such as: fever, chills, pain in the lower back or one side of the back, nausea, vomiting, urine mixed with blood... Pregnant women should go to the health facility as soon as possible to get checked to avoid more serious infections that affect their health.\n\nDiagnosis of postpartum urinary tract infection\nBefore giving a treatment regimen for postpartum urinary tract infections, the specialist will prescribe the pregnant woman some tests and diagnostic imaging as follows:\nUrine sample analysis: Taking a urine sample will help your doctor find white blood cells, red blood cells or bacteria to determine your infection.; Bacterial culture in the laboratory: This test shows the type of bacteria that is causing your infection to decide on the right medication.; Imaging diagnosis: Through ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the doctor will examine the urinary tract to find structural abnormalities; Endoscopy: If you have frequent UTIs, your doctor may perform a cystoscopy to check and evaluate the infection or take tissue and urine samples for further investigation.\n\nCan I take medicine while breastfeeding?\nAccording to Urology experts, Tam Anh General Hospital System, there are currently many types of antibiotics to treat urinary tract infections that are quite safe and cause few side effects, so they can still be prescribed to pregnant women with the disease. and are breastfeeding.\nHowever, not all urinary tract infections require treatment with medication. Instead, there are some effective tips for treating postpartum urinary tract infections shared below.\n\nTreatment of urinary tract infections after giving birth\nIn case of mild urinary tract infection\nIf there are signs of mild urinary tract infection, pregnant women can apply some advice such as:; Drink plenty of water to eliminate bacteria from the excretory system; Increase foods that can prevent pathogenic microorganisms from sticking to the urethral wall, such as cranberries and citrus fruits; Clean the private area properly with mild detergents; Regularly change sanitary napkins to avoid stagnant lochia; Choose cool clothes to prevent bacteria from growing; Be cautious when having sex and pay attention to cleanliness immediately afterward\nPost-coital urinary tract infection is a medical condition caused by E.coli bacteria and other types of bacteria during unsafe sex, especially through the anus.\nDon't be subjective because the disease can get worse quickly if not treated promptly\nIn case of severe urinary tract infection\nWhen postpartum urinary tract infection becomes severe, the doctor will prescribe medication to help the mother reduce fever, pain and inflammation. The beta lactam broad-spectrum antibiotic group is quite safe and can be prescribed to pregnant women with urinary tract infections without affecting the health of mother and baby.\nNormally, for uncomplicated infections, the patient will take antibiotics for 2-3 days.\nIn cases of severe infection, the patient may need to be treated with medication for about 14 days or more, as recommended by the doctor.\n\nMeasures to prevent postpartum urinary tract infections\nPostpartum urinary tract infections are very common and there is currently no sure way to help you avoid this risk. However, some of the following good tips can help you improve your overall health and effectively prevent infections: (3)\nUrinate within the first 6-8 hours after birth.
