    "content": "Urinary tract infections: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment\n\nUrinary tract infections are quite common and can be completely cured. However, if not detected and treated promptly, this condition can cause many serious complications, even death. Therefore, equipping yourself with knowledge about this disease will help you proactively prevent and treat it promptly.\n\nWhat is urinary tract infection?\nUrinary tract infection or urinary tract infection is a condition that occurs when urine is contaminated with bacteria, causing some organs in the urinary system to become infected (1). The disease has 3 ways to classify, including:\nClassification by location: Upper urinary tract inflammation (acute pyelonephritis, chronic pyelonephritis, kidney abscess, pyelonephritis) and lower urinary tract inflammation (cystitis, urethritis, orchitis, prostatitis).; Classification according to progression: simple urinary tract infections and complicated urinary tract infections. Complicated urinary tract infections are common in people with urinary system abnormalities that cause urinary tract obstruction such as neurogenic bladder, urinary stones, prostate enlargement, pregnant women, and urinary tract catheters.\n\nCauses of urinary tract infections\nAbout 95% of the causes of urinary tract infections are due to bacterial superinfection upstream of the urethra into the bladder (5% from the bloodstream), of which Escherichia coli (E.coli) accounts for 80% of the pathogens.\nEscherichia Coli is a bacteria that resides in the intestinal tract. They also appear on the skin near the anus and can penetrate the urinary tract if you do not know how to clean it properly. Women's urinary tract and anus are closer than men's, so the risk of infection is also higher.\nUrinary tract infections in men\nE.coli bacteria are a common cause of illness; Inflammation of the foreskin and foreskin due to improper hygiene; Injury to the penis due to rough sex, causing irritation to the urethra, leading to urethritis; Factors that increase the risk of disease: stones, prostate enlargement, neurogenic bladder, ureteral stenosis, urethral stenosis...\nUrinary tract infection in women\nThe habit of cleaning private areas from back to front, holding urine for too long, unclean personal hygiene... will create conditions for bacteria to invade and grow and cause urinary tract infections.; Unhealthy sex, not cleaning private areas before and after intercourse; Women during menstruation use poor quality sanitary napkins or do not change sanitary napkins every 3-4 hours.; Some risk factors: urinary tract stones, neurogenic bladder, ureteral stenosis, pregnancy.\nUrinary tract infection during pregnancy is one of the most common conditions in pregnant women. The disease increases the risk of dangerous complications for both you and your baby such as pyelonephritis, miscarriage, premature birth, neonatal infections, etc.\n\nSymptoms of urinary tract infection\nLocal symptoms\nSome cases of infection have no symptoms and are only accidentally discovered during a urine test. Common victims of the disease are often sexually active women, pregnant women, people with diabetes... (2)\nPatients will feel uncomfortable when urinating, such as painful urination, frequent urination, and the feeling of urine remaining in the bladder even though they have just urinated. Urine is cloudy, has a strong odor, and contains blood or pus. Some cases go to the doctor because of pain in the lower abdomen during cystitis or pain in the lower back during pyelonephritis or kidney abscess. When there are kidney stones causing fluid retention, infection or kidney abscess, the patient will be very painful when examined at this location.\nWhole body symptoms\nThe kidneys are organs that come into direct contact with the blood. This organ must receive a large amount of blood to filter and form urine. Therefore, when bacteria enter the urinary system, they can easily enter the bloodstream and spread throughout the body, causing severe sepsis, moreover, septic shock and can lead to death. Patients will have symptoms such as high fever, chills, dry lips, dirty tongue, and haggard face.\nSymptoms in men\nAbnormalities in urine: The color turns cloudy yellow, a strange, foul smell appears, there may be blood or pus mixed in the urine.; Urinary disorders: The disease will cause the patient to urinate frequently and frequently. Every time you urinate, very little urine is secreted, even just a few drops.; Burning pain and itching in the urinary tract: Pus may appear on the mouth of the urethra; Pain in the lower abdomen and lumbar area: When having sex, the pain will become more intense.\nSymptoms in women\nFrequent urination: Every 15 - 20 minutes, feeling uncomfortable at night. When urinating, urine is very little, even non-existent. The patient feels pain in the lower abdomen; Frequent urination, painful urination: There is a burning sensation when urinating; Unusual urine: Has a strong odor, cloudy color, may contain blood or pus.; Cramping pain in the waist or lower abdomen: This pain is caused by inflammation spreading to the ureters and kidneys. If not treated immediately, the patient will also have high fever, nausea, and chills.\n\nIs urinary tract infection dangerous?\nSimple urinary tract infections, which occur in young women and do not have urinary tract abnormalities, mostly do not cause complications. On the contrary, complicated urinary infections in patients with pre-existing favorable factors can lead to many serious complications, even life-threatening if not treated promptly.\nThe risks and complications of urinary tract infection are many, such as bacterial virulence causing destruction of kidney tissue, renal papillary necrosis, causing obstruction or impaired kidney function. This condition, if left for a long time, can lead to permanent kidney failure or require kidney removal.\nUrinary system infections in men can cause prostate abscess, orchitis, epididymitis, blockage of the vas deferens, and increased risk of infertility.\nIf the persistent presence of bacteria in the urinary system is not treated promptly and with a sufficient dose of antibiotics, the bacteria will easily move into the blood, causing sepsis, septic shock, and death.\n\nTreatment of urinary tract infections\nAntibiotics are the most commonly used treatment for urinary tract infections (3). If the patient only has localized symptoms in the lower urinary tract due to cystitis or urethritis, the doctor will prescribe oral antibiotics for 5-7 days. If there are symptoms of fever and chills, sepsis, or inflammation in the upper urinary tract, the patient needs to be hospitalized to use intravenous antibiotics.\nIn case the disease recurs many times, the patient has a urinary tract malformation or is having a urinary tube inserted, the doctor will culture the bacteria to find the right antibiotic that is sensitive to that strain of bacteria.\nIn addition, drugs with antiseptic properties on the urinary system are also noted for their effectiveness in killing bacteria and can be prescribed for use with antibiotics. However, the evidence for these drugs remains unclear.\nIf the infection cannot be controlled with medication or there are complications in the kidneys such as septic hydronephrosis, pus in the kidney, or kidney abscess, the patient needs to undergo surgical treatment to easily drain the infection. Similar to urinary system defects, without complete surgical correction, patients may face the risk of the disease recurring over time, leading to dangerous complications.\n\nPrevent urinary tract infections\nMake sure to drink enough 2l - 2.5l of water every day. Because this habit will help the kidneys increase urine excretion to expel germs, limiting upstream infection.; Maintain proper genital hygiene, especially for women during menstruation.; People who have had or are currently suffering from kidney and urinary stones need to be regularly examined and screened for urinary tract infections for timely intervention.; When suffering from urinary tract infection, patients need correct and thorough treatment from the beginning to prevent recurrence.\nCenter for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology - Urology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts, Internal Medicine and Surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
