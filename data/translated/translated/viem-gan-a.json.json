    "content": "Hepatitis A: Causes, signs and treatments\n\nHepatitis A is one of the most common types of viral hepatitis in the world, with a high incidence in low- and middle-income countries. Most infected people are children younger than 10 years old (90%). In Vietnam, the disease appears sporadically, concentrated in the Central Highlands and places with poor sanitary conditions. According to Dr. Huynh Van Trung, hepatitis A is mainly transmitted through the gastrointestinal tract (fecal-oral route). Viruses penetrate into the body through contaminated food, follow the blood to the liver, causing infection and forming many unpleasant symptoms for the patient.\n\nWhat is hepatitis A?\nHepatitis A (hepatitis A) is an acute liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). The disease causes damage to liver epithelial cells, affecting liver activity and function.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), each year there are about 1.4 million cases of hepatitis A in the world. This form of hepatitis is easily spread through contaminated food or water. Most people with hepatitis A recover within a few months and do not develop any serious health problems. (2)\n\nSymptoms of hepatitis A\nJaundice in patients with hepatitis A\nSigns and symptoms of hepatitis A often appear suddenly, 2-4 weeks after the patient is infected with the virus. They may include:\nFatigue: Liver activity is impaired, toxins are not eliminated properly, causing the body to become sluggish, tired and uncomfortable.; Digestive disorders: Liver infection affects the functioning of the digestive system, leading to nausea or vomiting, loss of appetite, loss of appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pain or discomfort in the upper abdominal area. Right…; Mild fever: If the patient has a mild and prolonged fever, they should go to the doctor to check whether they are infected with the HAV virus or not; Skin manifestations: Yellow skin and eyes are typical symptoms of viral hepatitis. The degree of yellowing of the skin and eyes depends on the degree of liver damage. Patients may have itchy skin when obstructive jaundice is severe.; Dark yellow urine; Pale, dull gray stools: Changes in blood bilirubin levels also affect the color of urine and stools.; Muscle and joint pain: This symptom is quite rare (only about 10%) but is often a sign that the disease is severe and complicated, requiring timely examination and treatment.\nNot everyone infected will show the above symptoms. Adults often have more obvious symptoms than children. Only about 10% of children under 6 years old infected with hepatitis A virus have jaundice, while the rate of jaundice cases in older children and infected adults is up to more than 70%.\nSymptoms of hepatitis A usually disappear after a few weeks. However, there are also cases where the infection becomes more severe, lasting up to several months or leading to dangerous complications. (3)\n\nCause of the disease and route of transmission of hepatitis A virus\nUnhygienic eating is one of the main causes of hepatitis A\nThe cause of hepatitis A is the hepatitis A virus entering liver cells and causing inflammation. This disease is closely related to personal hygiene, food hygiene and environmental hygiene. According to Dr. Trung, the virus that causes the disease can live for months in a polluted environment, therefore, areas with poor sanitation and hygiene practices have a very high rate of people infected with hepatitis A virus.\nPath of transmission of hepatitis A virus\nThe main way of spread of hepatitis A virus is through the gastrointestinal tract (fecal-oral route), that is, eating food or drinking water containing the virus. Besides, this virus can also be transmitted through close contact (oral-anal sex) with an infected person. Specifically, some cases that can spread the virus are as follows:\nEating unsanitary food, the person preparing it is infected with hepatitis A virus or not following proper hand washing procedures before touching food; Eating raw shellfish (shrimp, crab, oysters, snails...) from polluted water sources; Using water contaminated with hepatitis A virus; Eating together, sharing personal items (eating utensils, towels, toothbrushes...) with people with hepatitis A; Having sex with someone infected with the virus.\nIn addition, the virus can also be transmitted through blood, but the possibility of spreading this way is very low because very little hepatitis A virus exists in the patient's blood.\n\nSubjects at high risk of hepatitis A\nThe hepatitis A virus is very contagious, and anyone who has not been vaccinated against hepatitis A can become infected. The most common sufferers of the disease are children 5 - 14 years old.\nSome factors can increase your risk of hepatitis A, including:\nLive, work or travel in areas with high rates of hepatitis A; Working as a babysitter or working at child care centers; Living in the same house as a person with hepatitis A; Illegal drug use; HIV positive; Frequently having unprotected sex, especially gay sex; Have a blood clotting disorder.\nNot having the above risk factors does not mean you cannot be infected with hepatitis A virus. In all cases, patients should see a specialist to ask about their risks and specific condition.\nIn particular, patients need to get tested soon if they have symptoms of hepatitis A or suspect they have recently been exposed to the hepatitis A virus but have not yet shown symptoms. Although hepatitis A is not too dangerous, patients still need to see a doctor to rule out more serious conditions.\n\nComplications of hepatitis A\nIn rare cases, hepatitis A can lead to acute liver failure\nUnlike other types of viral hepatitis, hepatitis A does not cause long-term liver damage and does not develop into chronic hepatitis. In most cases, patients will recover completely after 1-2 months of treatment. The virus that causes the disease also does not remain in the body after recovery. However, if the patient is old or has other health problems such as diabetes, anemia, congestive heart failure, etc., the disease may get worse, prolonging treatment time.\nIn rare cases, hepatitis A can lead to acute liver failure. This complication is most common in older adults and people with pre-existing chronic liver disease. Patients with acute liver failure need to be hospitalized immediately for monitoring and treatment. Some people with acute liver failure may need a liver transplant.\n\nDiagnosis of hepatitis A\nTo diagnose hepatitis A, the doctor will first ask about the symptoms the patient is experiencing, as well as review personal medical history. After that, the doctor may prescribe the patient a blood test to detect HAV-specific antibodies in the blood.\nWhen infected with hepatitis A virus, the patient's body will create antibodies against this virus, called anti-HAV (including 2 types: IgM and IgG). Testing these antibodies helps doctors determine HAV virus infection. (first)\n1. IgM antibody (Anti HAV-IgM)\nIf the test result is positive (IgM antibodies are present in the plasma), the patient may be infected or recently infected with hepatitis A virus. IgM antibodies appear early after the patient has the first clinical symptoms and peak 60 - 90 days after infection. After 3 - 12 months of infection, this antibody will disappear.\n2. IgG antibody (Anti HAV-IgG)\nIf IgG antibodies are present in the blood, the patient may have recently been infected with hepatitis A virus or had been infected many years ago. After IgM antibodies disappear, IgG antibodies will appear and remain permanently in the blood to protect the body against HAV virus attacks.\nThe results of these tests also show whether the person tested has ever been vaccinated against hepatitis A. If the patient has been vaccinated with this vaccine and tests positive for anti-HAV antibodies, the vaccine is effective.\nIn addition to testing for hepatitis A, the doctor may prescribe the patient to check blood bilirubin levels and liver enzyme levels to determine the level of damage and provide appropriate treatment.\n\nTreatment of hepatitis A\nWash your hands to prevent spreading hepatitis A virus to others\nCurrently, there is no specific treatment for hepatitis A. If you think you have been exposed to the hepatitis A virus, you should see your doctor immediately to receive a vaccine or hepatitis immune globulin. A to prevent the development of the disease. Note that this method is only effective when the patient is vaccinated soon after exposure to the virus (within 2 weeks).\nTreatment for hepatitis A mainly focuses on minimizing unpleasant symptoms caused by the disease. The body will eliminate the virus on its own, and most patients will recover and recover within 6 months after infection.\nDr. Trung advises people with hepatitis A to pay attention to the following issues:\nFocus on rest: People infected with hepatitis A often feel tired, weak and have less energy. Therefore, patients should rest a lot until their body feels better.; Skin care: Some people with hepatitis A experience intense itching on the skin. To limit this condition, patients should keep the house cool, wear loose clothes and do not bathe in water that is too hot.; Get enough calories for the body: Patients may feel anorexia and lose their appetite. To still ensure adequate nutrition, patients should choose foods high in calories. Patients can also drink fruit juice or milk instead of water.; Eat many small meals: Dividing your diet into many small meals instead of large meals will help you digest more easily, reduce feelings of nausea and discomfort.; Avoid alcohol and use medications carefully: An inflamed liver may have difficulty processing drugs and alcohol. Therefore, people with hepatitis A should not drink alcohol and inform their doctor about all medications they are using, including over-the-counter medications.\nIn addition, during daily activities, patients also need to take measures to reduce the risk of transmitting hepatitis A virus to others:\nAvoid sexual intercourse: People with hepatitis A need to avoid all sexual activities to limit the risk of infecting their partner. Using condoms is not effective in preventing transmission of this disease.; Wash your hands after going to the toilet: Washing your hands thoroughly according to the Ministry of Health's 6-step process not only helps prevent hepatitis A infection but also protects patients from many other dangerous diseases. Do not prepare food for others: Sick people can easily transmit the HAV virus during food preparation. Therefore, patients should not do this until the infection is completely cured.\n\nPrevent hepatitis A\nVaccination is the best way to prevent hepatitis A\nThe best way to prevent hepatitis A is to get vaccinated against hepatitis A. The hepatitis A vaccine is usually given in two doses. The second injection is repeated 6 - 12 months after the first injection. The vaccine is recommended for the following:\nAll children 1 year and older; Adults are at high risk of HAV infection such as: Working or traveling in places with high rates of hepatitis A Having a family member with HAV infection Laboratory workers who may be exposed to the hepatitis A virus For People who are working in jobs with a high risk of exposure such as childcare workers, nurses, wastewater treatment workers, etc. People with health problems that increase the risk of infection such as blood clotting disorders , have chronic liver disease, including hepatitis B or hepatitis C Illegal drug users Gay or bisexual men.; Work or travel in places with high rates of hepatitis A; Someone in the family is infected with HAV; Laboratory workers may be exposed to the hepatitis A virus; Subjects working in jobs with high risk of exposure such as: child care workers, nurses, nurses, wastewater treatment workers...; People with health problems that increase the risk of infection such as blood clotting disorders or chronic liver disease, including hepatitis B or hepatitis C; Illegal drug users; Gay or bisexual men.\nIn addition, to limit the possibility of hepatitis A infection, you should also:\nWash hands thoroughly with soap and warm water before eating and after using the toilet; Eat cooked, drink boiled, limit eating out; Peel and wash all fresh fruits and vegetables yourself before eating.\n\nFrequently asked questions about hepatitis A\n1. How long is the incubation period of hepatitis A?\nAccording to WHO, the incubation period of hepatitis A is usually 14–28 days. Symptoms usually begin 2 – 6 weeks after exposure and last for about 2 months, although some people (about 10 – 15%) have symptoms that last up to 6 months.\n2. How long does the hepatitis A virus – HAV survive in the environment outside the body?\nHepatitis A virus can survive in the environment outside the body for many months if conditions are good. This virus is not affected by cold temperatures but can be killed at high temperatures, such as when cooking food at 185 degrees F (85 degrees C) for at least 1 minute. That is why eating cooked food and drinking boiled water can help prevent the infection of this disease.\n3. Can I get reinfected with HAV virus?\nPeople infected with HAV virus can be reinfected at a rate of 3-20%, usually occurring after a short period of time (< 3 weeks) with similar clinical symptoms as before, and are often milder.\nHepatitis A is a contagious disease and can lead to dangerous complications. Therefore, early examination and treatment when HAV infection appears or is suspected is very important. The doctor will help the patient determine the inflammation and level of liver damage, check to rule out serious diseases with similar symptoms, and provide instructions on care and treatment to quickly recover.\nGastrointestinal Endoscopy and Surgery Center, Tam Anh General Hospital is a reputable unit providing examination and treatment services for liver diseases such as viral hepatitis (including hepatitis A), cirrhosis. , liver failure, liver cancer...
