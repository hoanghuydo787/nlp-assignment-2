    "content": "Thumb flexor tendonitis: Causes, symptoms, treatment\n\nThumb flexor tendonitis is a non-life-threatening disease. The disease will affect the movement of the thumb, limiting the working ability and function of this finger. Patients need to be treated early to limit health risks and quickly regain the range of motion of their fingers.\n\nWhat is thumb flexor tendonitis?\nThumb flexor tendonitis occurs due to inflammation of the tendon sheath in the finger, causing narrowing of the tendon sheath. In some cases, fibrous granules also appear in the tendon sheath, causing tendon movement through the fibrous granule location to be hindered. Every time the patient bends or extends the thumb, it is very difficult and limited. They have to try hard to pop the finger out or have to use the healthy hand to pull the finger out. (first)\n\nCauses of thumb tendonitis\nSome occupations are at high risk of disease such as teachers, farmers, barbers, surgeons, craftsmen... They have to use their thumbs a lot, often performing pinching, grasping, … leads to tendinitis;; Due to injury in daily activities or while playing sports;; Complications from some diseases such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout...\n\nDisease symptoms\nThe common initial symptom is a slight painless twitching of the thumb or a feeling of discomfort every time it moves. As the disease progresses, the patient will experience swelling, popping sounds, and pain in the metacarpophalangeal joint or proximal interphalangeal joint in the palm of the hand. The disease also has the following symptoms: (2)\nThe thumb is often fixed, stuck or locked in a bent position when the patient moves.; Someone else needs to straighten or bend the finger back to its original position.; Feeling of pain in the tendon area, much pain when moving; Swelling may occur.\nThe disease is classified into 4 levels, specifically:\nLevel 1: Feeling of pain in the face, discomfort in the pulley, flexor tendon of the thumb.; Level 2: Finger stuck; Level 3: Locked thumb, can only move passively.; Level 4: Thumb locked, unable to move.\nWhen having the above symptoms, patients should go to medical facilities for timely examination and treatment. Delaying treatment will lead to chronic pain, limited range of motion of the thumb, and greatly affect daily activities.\n\nHow is thumb flexor tendonitis diagnosed?\nThrough clinical examination, when suspected of having the disease, the doctor will prescribe the patient to perform a number of tests to accurately determine the condition such as:\nUltrasound with transducer frequency > 7.5 - 20MHz: Helps doctors see thickened tendons and tendon sheaths, surrounding fluid and images of fibrous particles in the tendon sheath.; X-ray: Usually no special signs.; MRI scan: Helps doctors detect secretions, effusion or swelling of the tendon sheath; the structure and quality of the tendon may change.; Blood tests showed increased white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.\n\nThe treatments\nThumb flexor tendonitis is not a dangerous disease. The disease can be well controlled when detected early and treated properly. (3)\nInternally medical treatment\nPatients will receive medical treatment with the corresponding regimen, specifically:\nLimit movement of the damaged finger, you can use a finger splint to immobilize, apply cold compresses or infrared rays.; Use anti-inflammatory and pain relievers orally, inject or inject local corticosteroids; Use antibiotics when inflammation appears and when the whole body shows signs of infection.; Supplement vitamins, especially vitamin C.\nWith medical treatment according to the schedule, the disease still did not improve. Doctors may prescribe patients to:\nLocal corticosteroid injection: Only performed under the condition that there is an experienced musculoskeletal specialist and the injection room must be sterile. When performing corticosteroid injections, absolute sterility must be ensured.; Preparations: Methylprednisolone acetate (1ml = 40mg): This is a long-acting type. Dosage for each injection in the tendon sheath ranges from 8 - 20mg/time (0.2 - 0.5ml/time) based on location. Each batch is about 3 - 6 months apart, no more than 3 batches per year. Betamethasone (1ml = 5mg) Betamethasone dipropionate. 2mg Betamethasone sodium phosphate: This is a long-acting type. Dosage for each injection next to the joint ranges from 0.8 - 2mg/time (0.2 - 0.5ml/time) based on location. Each batch is about 3 - 6 months apart, no more than 3 batches per year. Absolutely contraindicated for local corticosteroid injection: Lesions caused by bacterial or fungal infections or infections that have not been eliminated; Infected lesions on or near the injection site. Relatively contraindicated for local corticosteroid injections (including contraindications of corticosteroids): High blood pressure, diabetes, duodenal ulcers (need treatment and monitoring before and after injection), the patient is using Use anticoagulants or have a blood clotting disorder. Some unwanted effects after local corticosteroid injection: Pain a few hours after injection, possibly lasting for several days, often occurs after the first injection; Local skin atrophy or pigmented patches due to too shallow injection (this condition will go away on its own within a few months to 2 years); infection.; Methylprednisolone acetate (1ml = 40mg): This is a long-acting type. Dosage for each injection in the tendon sheath ranges from 8 - 20mg/time (0.2 - 0.5ml/time) based on location. Each batch is about 3 - 6 months apart, no more than 3 batches per year.; Betamethasone (1ml = 5mg) Betamethasone dipropionate.; 2mg Betamethasone sodium phosphate: This is a long-acting type. Dosage for each injection next to the joint ranges from 0.8 - 2mg/time (0.2 - 0.5ml/time) based on location.

The surgeon will cut the extensor tendon sheath, releasing the tendon at the inflamed extensor tendon cavity.\nThe risk that may occur after surgery is the effect of anesthetics/anesthesia on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems such as arrhythmia, respiratory failure..., which can be treated urgently depending on each specific case. . Other potential risks of surgery are also noted including:\nBleed.; Infection.; Damage to the sensory nerves of the fingers; Injury to muscles, tendons, blood vessels, ligaments or other structures; Poor scar healing and scars with increased paresthesia.\n\nPrecautions\nAvoid repetitive finger and hand activities for long periods of time, especially those that require frequent flexing of the thumb.; Take reasonable time to rest.; Perform exercises for the tendons and joints of the thumb and hand; Avoid massaging with medicinal alcohol and hot oil because it can easily make the inflammation worse; Because thumb flexor tendonitis can be a complication of diabetes, arthritis, etc., patients need to have regular health check-ups to control the condition well and prevent complications of thumb tendonitis.; Supplement adequate nutrition in your daily diet, especially foods rich in calcium and vitamin C.\nCenter for Orthopedic Trauma, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is where a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons gather such as: TTND.Prof.Dr.Nguyen Viet Tien; Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa; Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh; MSc.BS.CKII Tran Anh Vu; BS.CKI Tran Xuan Anh, MSc.CKI Le Dinh Khoa, PhD.Do Tien Dung; Dr. BS.CKII Vu Huu Dung... This is also one of the pioneer units in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal diseases with modern techniques according to updated international protocols.\nThe hospital is also equipped with modern machinery and imaging equipment such as: Somatom Drive 768-slice CT scanner, new generation Magnetom Amira BioMatrix magnetic resonance machine, Artis Pheno robot, densitometer. bones, ultrasound machines...; Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss surgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table... to be able to detect injuries early and effectively treat musculoskeletal diseases...\nTam Anh General Hospital also owns a spacious clinic system and high-class boarding area; modern rehabilitation area; Comprehensive post-operative care process helps patients quickly recover and stabilize their health after surgery.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Orthopedics Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nAs soon as signs of thumb flexor tendonitis appear, the patient needs to quickly go to the hospital for early examination. This will bring high efficiency to the medical treatment process. If treatment is delayed, doctors may have to perform surgery in cases where the disease has progressed severely.",
