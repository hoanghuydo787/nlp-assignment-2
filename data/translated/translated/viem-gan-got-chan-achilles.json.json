    "content": "Achilles tendonitis: Causes, symptoms, home treatment\n\nAchilles tendonitis is a common disease, especially in professional athletes. This injury causes pain and makes it difficult for the patient to carry out daily activities. If not treated promptly and properly, the patient may experience dangerous complications.\n\nWhat is Achilles tendonitis?\nAchilles tendinitis is a condition in which the Achilles tendon is overactive, leading to overload in force and gravity, causing damage to the heel area. The Achilles tendon is an area with few blood vessels, 3 - 6cm from the place where it attaches to the heel bone. The tendon's structure consists of many small collagen fibers, so just one sudden impact is enough to damage the heel. (first)\nSee more: What is foot tendonitis?\nAchilles tendonitis is divided into 2 types, specifically:\nInternal Achilles tendinitis: This injury affects the lowest part of the tendon, where it attaches to the heel bone.; Noninsertional Achilles tendinitis: This is an inflammatory condition involving the fibers in the middle part of the tendon, often occurring in young people.\n\nCauses of Achilles tendonitis\nRepetitive stress on the legs is the main cause of Achilles tendonitis. This condition often occurs in people who exercise excessively, especially athletes. In addition, some bone and joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, infectious arthritis... can also be the cause of Achilles tendonitis. (2)\nCommon causes of Achilles tendonitis include:\nNot warming up or warming up incorrectly before exercising.; Leg muscle tension when performing repetitive movements; Play sports that require changing directions and moving quickly such as soccer, tennis, basketball, volleyball...; Sudden increase in physical activity without giving the body time to adapt; Wearing shoes that do not fit your feet, shoes that are too old or of poor quality; Wear high heels continuously for long periods of time.; Bone spurs appear on the back of the heel (heel spurs).; Tendon degeneration due to age.\nIn addition, some factors that increase the risk of Achilles tendon injury include:\nGender: The disease is common in men; Age: The older a person is, the higher the risk of Achilles tendonitis. Because at that time, blood circulation to the foot tendon area has decreased. This condition causes the heel tendon to lose flexibility, suppleness and elasticity. Therefore, any impact that occurs has the potential to injure the Achilles tendon.; People with flat foot syndrome are at high risk of developing Achilles tendonitis. The reason is that the body's weight will then fall heavily on the Achilles tendon, creating great pressure on this area, easily causing Achilles tendonitis.; Suffering from diseases: People with psoriasis or hypertension have a higher rate of inflamed heel tendons than people without the disease.; Effects of medications: Some antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones can increase the risk of Achilles tendonitis.\n\nSymptoms of Achilles tendonitis are common\nSome signs and symptoms that may occur when the Achilles tendon is inflamed are:\nBurning pain or stiffness in the lower back calf in the morning. In some cases, there may be a partial laceration of the liver or a complete tendon rupture.; Pain in the heel area, especially when stretching the heel or standing on tiptoes. When Achilles tendonitis persists without intervention, the patient is at high risk of rupture of the Achilles tendon.; If a tendon is ruptured, the patient will have persistent pain and swelling in the heel area due to bleeding between the tendons.\n\nIs Achilles tendonitis dangerous?\nIn addition to persistent pain, if treatment is delayed or treated incorrectly, Achilles tendinitis can lead to many dangerous complications such as:\nLimited mobility; Deformity of the tendons and bones of the heel; Complete rupture of the Achilles tendon\n\nDiagnostic method\nTo diagnose Achilles tendinitis, the doctor will check the patient's symptoms and normal activities. Then, the doctor may gently press on the damaged area to determine the location of pain and swelling. The patient may also be asked to stand on a ball to evaluate the flexibility, range of motion and reflexes of the foot and ankle. (3)\nIn addition, the doctor may prescribe the patient to perform a number of other tests such as:\nX-ray: This diagnostic method helps doctors observe images of the feet and leg bones. While an X-ray cannot provide an image of the tendon, it can help your doctor rule out other possible causes of similar symptoms.; Ultrasound: This method uses high-frequency sound waves to create detailed images of soft tissues such as tendons. In addition, ultrasound can also create images of the tendon's movement, so the doctor can evaluate blood flow around the tendon.; MRI scan: This is a diagnostic method that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the heel tendon, thereby helping doctors detect the location of the inflamed tendon.\n\nTreatment of Achilles tendonitis\nSome possible treatments for Achilles tendonitis are: (4)\nRICE\nMost minor injuries can heal on their own when the patient knows how to take good care of them. You can apply the R.I.C.E injury first aid method to treat Achilles tendonitis at home, specifically:\nRest - rest: Rest will help the body produce new energy, thereby increasing the ability to recover from tendon damage. This method also helps reduce pressure on the bones and heel tendons, helping the tendons relax and heal faster. The patient should rest until they can walk without feeling pain in the leg with tendinitis.\nIn addition, during rest, if you want to move, you should use crutches to support yourself and limit pressure on your legs.\nIce: The patient can place an ice pack on the injured area for about 15 - 20 minutes to reduce pain and swelling.; Compression: Use a cloth bandage or elastic bandage to immobilize the injured area, helping to reduce swelling of the tendon. However, you should not bandage too tightly because it can hinder blood circulation to the heel area, making the damage worse.; Elevation - elevating the injured position: The patient should raise the injured leg higher than the heart, helping to reduce swelling and pain effectively.\nUse medicine\nPatients can use over-the-counter pain relievers or anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen, ibuprofen, aspirin... In cases of long-term pain, the patient may be prescribed some pain relievers. inflammation or strong pain relief to improve symptoms. In addition, doctors can also give patients platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections or steroid injections.\nPhysical therapy\nA doctor or physical therapist may recommend certain treatments for Achilles tendonitis, such as:\nPerforming therapeutic exercises helps promote wound healing, helps strengthen the Achilles tendon and limits the risk of recurring inflammation.; Patients should use supportive devices such as cushions or elevated insoles to reduce stress on the tendons.\nAchilles tendon surgery\nWhen conservative treatment is not effective, your doctor may prescribe surgical intervention. In addition, this method is also indicated for cases of tendon rupture or risk of tendon rupture. Achilles tendon fusion surgery will help patients restore mobility.\nDuring surgery, the doctor will make an incision in the back of the heel. If the tendon is ruptured, the doctor will reattach it. If the tendon degenerates, the doctor will remove the damaged tendon and then repair the remaining tendon with sutures. In cases of severe tendon damage, the doctor may consider replacing part or all of the Achilles tendon.\nCurrently, Tam Anh General Hospital system has applied percutaneous Achilles tendon fusion surgery as a minimally invasive procedure. This method helps patients recover quickly, has smaller surgical scars, less pain, and minimizes the risk of complications.\n\nPrecautions\nTo limit the risk of Achilles tendonitis, you should note:\nAvoid suddenly increasing your activity level: If you have just started an exercise regimen, you should do it slowly, gradually increasing the duration and intensity of the exercise to give your body time to adapt and avoid putting pressure on your heels. ; Do not overexert yourself: You should avoid activities that cause excessive stress to your tendons. If you have to participate in strenuous activities, you need to warm up first to warm up your body, helping your muscles and connective tissue become more flexible when entering the main exercise. During exercise, if you feel pain, you should stop immediately and rest.; Stretch your muscles: You should take time to stretch your leg muscles and tendons every morning before exercising. This will help prevent recurring inflammation, strengthen tendons and muscles, and limit inflammation.; Avoid running on hard or slippery surfaces; Choose clothes suitable for the type of exercise.; Diversify exercises: You can replace high-intensity exercises such as running, climbing stairs, jumping... with low-intensity exercises such as walking, swimming... This will help you limit the condition. increases too much pressure on the Achilles tendon, causing injury; Choose the right shoes: In addition to fitting your feet, training shoes need to provide good support for all foot activities.\nIn addition, you should replace your training shoes with new ones if they are old or excessively worn.\nCenter for Orthopedic Trauma, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is where a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons gather such as: TTND.Prof.Dr.Nguyen Viet Tien; Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa; Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh; MSc. Tran Anh Vu; Dr. Do Tien Dung; Dr. BS.CK II Vu Huu Dung... This is also one of the pioneer units in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal diseases with modern techniques according to the world's leading advanced protocols.\nThe hospital is also equipped with a system of modern machinery and imaging equipment such as: Somatom Drive 768-slice CT scanner, new generation magnetic resonance machine Magnetom Amira BioMatrix, bone density measuring machine, ultrasound machine. minus…; Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss surgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table... to be able to detect injuries early and successfully surgically treat musculoskeletal diseases...\nTam Anh General Hospital also owns a spacious clinic system and high-class boarding area; modern rehabilitation area; Comprehensive post-operative care process helps patients quickly recover and stabilize their health after surgery.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Orthopedics Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nAchilles tendonitis, if not well cared for, can lead to many dangerous complications. Therefore, as soon as symptoms appear, patients should go to the hospital as soon as possible to be examined, diagnosed and instructed to properly care for the injury, preventing serious complications.",
