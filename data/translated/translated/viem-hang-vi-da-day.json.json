    "content": "Gastritis antrum: Causes, symptoms and prevention\n\nAntral gastritis is the most common digestive disease with typical symptoms such as dull pain in the epigastric area, heartburn, belching, bloating, indigestion... The disease is damage to the stomach at the location of the antrum. taste, is caused by many different causes including living habits, nutrition as well as mental health. Gastritis can be completely treated. However, the disease can also lead to bad complications if left untreated or recurs many times.\n\nWhat is antral gastritis?\nAntral gastritis is a condition in which the stomach is damaged, specifically inflammation at the antrum. The disease has common symptoms such as dull pain, gnawing epigastric pain, belching, heartburn, bloating, indigestion...\nThe gastric mucosa is a thin membrane that protects the stomach wall from harmful agents and acids. When the mucosal layer is irritated or damaged, inflammation will result\nGastric antral inflammation has many causes, the most common being infection with Helicobacter pylori (HP bacteria). After entering the stomach, HP bacteria will reside and damage the gastric mucosa. From there, it causes inflammation and leads to disease symptoms.\nThe treatment of antral gastritis is relatively simple, the patient can be completely cured by taking medication as prescribed by the doctor. However, people with a history of antral gastritis can have the disease relapse if they do not take careful care of their general health and digestion.\nGastric antrum inflammation that recurs many times or goes untreated for a long time is one of the main causes of dangerous complications such as ulcers, bleeding, even perforation or cancer. Therefore, patients still need to pay attention to their digestive health and minimize repeated infections to prevent dangerous complications like the above.(1)\n\nLearn about the gastric antrum\nWhere is the location of the gastric antrum?\nThe gastric antrum is located near the end of the stomach, between the body and pylorus. The stomach has 5 main parts including: cardia, gastric bulge, body, antrum and pylorus\nThe gastric antrum is considered an important part inside the stomach, a sensitive and vulnerable place. Therefore, cases of antral gastritis are tending to increase.\n\nCauses and diseases related to the gastric antrum\nThe most common cause of damage to the stomach in general and the antrum in particular is Hp infection, the second group of causes includes abuse of alcohol, beer, cigarettes, pain relievers of the NSAIDs group that are not as prescribed, and others. Thirdly, such as irregular diet, tension, stress...\nDamage to the stomach in the antral area can cause mild to severe diseases such as: acute antral inflammation, antral ulcers, atrophic antral inflammation, malt lymphoma or even gastric antral cancer.\n1. HP infection\nHelicobacter Pylori is the name of a type of spirochete, aerobic, gram-negative bacteria that exists in the first layer of the gastric mucosa and causes stomach-related diseases.\nHP bacteria normally enter the human body through the digestive tract. This is largely related to the area, environment and quality of life. When HP bacteria have entered the body, they can grow silently, causing increased acid levels and changes in the antral mucosal environment. During that process, the patient may not have any symptoms.\n2. Abuse of NSAID anti-inflammatory drugs\nAnti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs are one of the leading causes of antral gastritis. Patients need to comply with the use of this group of pain relievers according to the doctor's orders, avoid taking drugs arbitrarily, which can lead to serious stomach damage.\n3. Stress, depression\nStress and depression are some of the typical problems from mental health. The enteric nervous system communicates with the central nervous system. Therefore, conditions such as stress and depression all affect digestive health.\n4. Unscientific diet and lifestyle\nUnscientific diet and lifestyle increase the risk of gastric antrum. Irregular eating, eating too much indigestible and hot foods are factors that lead to stomach diseases, including antral gastritis.\nBesides, alcohol and cigarettes stimulate increased acidity inside the stomach wall. This condition can easily lead to antral gastritis in humans.\nAnother problem, although sleep activities do not have much impact on the stomach antrum. But sleep is a factor in stress and other mental health problems. This is the same factor that causes antral gastritis as the cause of stress and depression.\n\nSymptoms of antral gastritis\nEach person will have different causes of illness and health conditions. From there, the disease will cause different symptoms. In some cases, antral gastritis can develop asymptomatically.\nSome signs of gastric antrum inflammation that patients can recognize include:\nPain appears in the epigastric area; Feeling of fullness in the abdomen, burning sensation in the epigastrium; Belching, heartburn; Anorexia; Nausea and vomiting; Vomiting blood or having black stools\nIf one of the above signs appears for a long time, the patient needs to go to the hospital to be examined and diagnosed by a specialist early. If gastritis is not treated promptly, it can lead to dangerous complications.\n\nDiagnosis of antral gastritis\nAntral gastritis is often diagnosed by gastroscopy. Besides, depending on the needs and symptoms of each patient, the doctor will prescribe an appropriate diagnostic method.\nSome methods of diagnosing antral gastritis and causes:\nGastroscopy: Gastroscopy helps determine the exact location and extent of damage in the antrum. At the same time, through endoscopy, CLO test can be performed, a test to evaluate Helicobacter pylori infection in the stomach.; Gastroscopy: Gastroscopy helps determine the exact location and extent of damage in the antrum. At the same time, through endoscopy, CLO test can be performed, a test to evaluate Helicobacter pylori infection in the stomach.\nBlood test: The goal of the blood test is to check for the presence of antibodies against Hp bacteria in the patient's blood. The downside is that if the patient was previously infected and has been treated, sometimes the blood test is still positive several months later. Therefore, blood tests are not applicable to check the effectiveness of previous Hp treatment.; Blood test: The goal of the blood test is to check for the presence of antibodies against Hp bacteria in the patient's blood. The downside is that if the patient was previously infected and has been treated, sometimes the blood test is still positive several months later. Therefore, blood tests are not applicable to check the effectiveness of previous Hp treatment.\nBreath test: sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing Hp are similar to endoscopy, is an alternative to endoscopy if you simply need to determine whether or not you are infected with Hp in the stomach.; Breath test: sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing Hp are similar to endoscopy, and are an alternative to endoscopy if you simply need to determine whether or not you are infected with Hp in the stomach.\n\nMethods of treating gastric antrum inflammation\nTreatment should be a combination of medication and non-medication\n1. Use medicine to treat antral gastritis\nFor patients with antral gastritis caused by HP bacteria infection, the doctor will prescribe treatment to kill the bacteria with antibiotics first. The usual treatment regimen for HP bacteria lasts 14 days, combining at least 2 oral antibiotics and stomach acid inhibitors. Antibiotics commonly used to kill HP bacteria include:\nAmoxicillin; Tetracycline; Metronidazole; Tinidazole; Fluoroquinolone; Bismuth\nFor antral gastritis, drugs are often used to reduce the impact of acid on the gastric antral wall and increase mucosal protection. Some medications commonly used to treat antral gastritis include:\nHistamine H2 receptor blockers; Proton pump inhibitors; Drugs that neutralize gastric acid\n2. Change eating habits\nPatients are encouraged to change their eating habits and healthy lifestyle to support the treatment process of antral gastritis.\nChanging eating habits and diet is not a cure for antral gastritis, but can help shorten recovery time, improve digestive health and minimize the possibility of disease recurrence.(2)\nDark-colored vegetables are nutritious foods and are preferred for people with digestive problems such as antral gastritis.\nBesides, building the habit of limiting alcohol consumption and use of stimulants is also an effective way to improve and maintain cavernous function at a stable level.\n\nDangerous complications\nPatients may experience dangerous complications or persistent inflammation that recurs many times, especially accompanied by Hp infection and prolonged use of alcohol and tobacco:\nHemorrhagic stomach ulcer; Severe atrophic gastritis; Gastric pyloric stenosis; Stomach cancer\n\nPrevent gastric antrum inflammation\nThe best way to prevent antral gastritis is to maintain a healthy lifestyle and scientific diet. By managing the quality of your living environment, daily habits and good mental health, you can minimize the risk of antral gastritis.\nEffective methods to prevent gastric antrum inflammation include:\nMaintain good personal hygiene and living environment; Always wash your hands; Limit eating foods that can irritate the mucosa such as spicy foods, caffeine, alcohol, etc.; Do not arbitrarily use antibiotics, pain relievers or NSAID anti-inflammatory drugs\n\nQuestions related to gastric antrum inflammation\n1. Is antral gastritis dangerous?\nGastritis is a disease that can be completely treated if detected early. The disease does not require complicated treatment methods and the treatment time is not too long.\nHowever, antral gastritis will develop into chronic gastritis or gastric bleeding if the disease is not treated promptly. These are typical complications of the disease, potentially increasing the patient's risk of stomach cancer.(3)\nWhen diagnosed with antral gastritis, the patient does not need to worry too much. However, it is important to follow your doctor's treatment instructions and change your diet and living habits to protect digestive health.\n2. What to eat and what to avoid for gastric antrum inflammation?\nPeople with antral gastritis need to supplement a lot of water, vitamins and good substances to improve antral function and restore damage. Foods that need to be added to the menu of patients with antral gastritis are foods that are beneficial to the digestive system and limit the growth of HP bacteria.\nFoods that help support the recovery of antral gastritis include:\nFlavonoid-rich vegetables such as apples, green tea and ginger; Foods containing beneficial bacteria such as yogurt; Vegetables are dark green; Foods rich in vitamins A and C such as sweet potatoes, guava, oranges, etc.\nIn addition, people with antral gastritis need to strictly limit foods that can irritate the mucosa and increase stomach acid. Those foods include:\nWine or alcoholic beverages; Hot, spicy food; Oily food\nCenter for Endoscopy and Gastrointestinal Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City) and Department of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreatic (Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing High-end, effective examination and treatment services for patients with mild to severe liver problems (fatty liver, acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer...), diseases about digestion (digestive disorders, gastrointestinal bleeding, stomach pain, gastritis, stomach bleeding, etc.).
