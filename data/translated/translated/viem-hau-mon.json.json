    "content": "Anal inflammation: Causes, symptoms and prevention\n\nAnal inflammation often comes from factors related to digestive health, gastrointestinal infections or digestive disorders. The disease causes symptoms of anal pain when going to the toilet and creates the feeling of needing to go to the toilet even though the patient's body does not have the need. Anal inflammation can occur in all ages and subjects, the most common is acute anal inflammation, which will go away after a short period of illness. However, the disease still has the potential risk of chronic anal inflammation that everyone needs to pay attention to and prevent.\n\nWhat is anal inflammation?\nAnal inflammation is a condition in which the skin around the anal opening is irritated, leading to symptoms of pain, burning or itching in the anal area, especially during defecation. In some severe cases, patients may also have blood in their stools.\nThis is a digestive health disease, often coming from conditions such as digestive disorders. Anal inflammation occurs when the lining of the anal canal becomes infected. Due to similar symptoms, anal inflammation is often confused with hemorrhoids. However, these are two completely different diseases. According to epidemiology, anal inflammation is largely related to diet. Highly acidic foods such as coffee and foods that are too hot and spicy will stimulate.\nMore clearly about the anatomy of the anus, this is the last part of the digestive tract, located at the end of the rectum. The anus has the function of holding feces in the body before being excreted. The anus consists of a sphincter, which opens during the process of expelling feces. In addition, the anus also has flat cells lining the inside of the anus, and the anal margin. In particular, this flat cell is also the place where anal-related diseases such as anal inflammation or, more seriously, anal cancer begin.(2)\nAnal inflammation is an inflammation of the lining of the anal canal, considered a common disorder of digestive health. In addition to these secondary causes, anal inflammation can also be a genetic disease, especially inherited from STIs. However, this cause is not as common as secondary causes due to inappropriate diet in patients.\nAnal inflammation is neither related nor likely to develop into hemorrhoids, but the disease has a similar etiology and treatment to rectal mucositis. Therefore, people with inflammation of the rectal mucosa can also be concluded to have anal inflammation.\nThe disease can be treated simply medically, almost without surgery. Except for cases where the patient experiences more serious complications, greatly affecting the patient's health and life.(1)\n\nWho is at risk of anal inflammation?\nAnyone is at risk of anal inflammation, the disease can happen to anyone of any age.\nAnal inflammation is mostly a consequence of disorders or infections of other organs of the digestive system. Therefore, people with weak digestive health or an unhealthy diet, consuming a lot of foods that can increase acid secretion in the body will be at high risk of anal inflammation.\nIn addition, people with cancer and radiation therapy are also at high risk of anal inflammation because of the effects of radiation. Cancer treatment with radiation therapy is one of the optimal methods and brings good results. However, the radiation that patients receive during treatment will also cause a number of other diseases, including anal inflammation and other digestive diseases. Therefore, patients need to follow the doctor's instructions and instructions to limit the risks of other diseases.\nBesides, anal inflammation is also reported by MSD Manual, men who have sex with men are also more likely to suffer from anal inflammation than normal people. This can be completely prevented by regular health checks. Therefore, people in this target group do not need to worry too much.\n\nCauses of anal inflammation\nThe cause of anal inflammation often comes from food and gastrointestinal disorders. These are considered secondary causes of anal inflammation in humans and the possibility of developing the disease will be even higher if the patient does not treat the cause properly or promptly.\n1. Intestinal inflammation\nEnteritis is an acute or chronic inflammation of the digestive tract, causing clinical symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea in patients.\nInflammatory bowel diseases include Crohn's and ulcerative colitis. The disease is the result of a cell-mediated immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Currently, there is still no official statement on the direct cause of intestinal inflammation, specifically crohn's and ulcerative colitis. However, based on statistics and medical evidence, the intestinal microbiota in people with multifactorial genetic predisposition has the ability to trigger abnormal immunity in this organ.\nInflammatory bowel disease is a disease with a high risk of leading to anal inflammation because the inflammation often takes place in the colon, which is close to the anal organ. Because of this nature of the disease, the infection can spread to the patient's anus.\n2. Sexually transmitted infections\nSexually transmitted infections, specifically STDs, are also considered the leading cause of anal inflammation. This cause is common in people who have regular anal sex.\nSexual intercourse has many potential risks of infection causing dangerous diseases, including anal inflammation. That's because the sexual organs in two individuals will be in direct contact with each other, for long periods of time. This is an opportunity for bad bacteria to be transmitted from person to person. The possibility of transmission is up to 90% if safety measures are not used, specifically condoms.\nNot only that, the friction will irritate the anus, sometimes causing damage such as scratches and swelling. From there, the risk of sexually transmitted anal inflammation in humans increases.\n3. Radiation therapy for cancer\nRadiation therapy for cancer is a method of destroying cancer cells with radiation. This is one of the optimal ways to treat cancer and brings positive results in cases where the disease is detected early.\nHowever, radiation will also cause other effects on the patient's health such as unwanted complications. Normally, diseases caused by radiotherapy are not too complicated, but need to be treated early to avoid causing additional physical and health inconveniences to the patient.\nGastrointestinal diseases such as stomach and duodenal ulcers are one of the complications caused by this radiation. And these health problems are also secondary causes of anal inflammation in patients. Therefore, people undergoing radiotherapy for cancer will have a high chance of developing anal inflammation during treatment.\nTo prevent this unwanted complication, patients need to strictly follow the doctor's treatment instructions. Besides, closely monitor your symptoms and health status. If there are any signs of anal inflammation, you should notify your doctor immediately so that they can be treated promptly.\n4. Overuse of antibiotics\nOveruse of antibiotics is one of the causes of stomach ulcers or duodenal ulcers. Arbitrary use of antibiotics not prescribed by doctors or medical professionals is always discouraged for patients.\nAntibiotics are drugs that inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria, often used in cases of acute inflammation caused by infection. However, antibiotics need to be used in the correct dosage depending on the type of disease and infection, otherwise the medicine will cause problems with stomach ulcers or other digestive organs.\nAnd because anal inflammation is a consequence of other digestive diseases, when a patient has gastric or duodenal ulcers due to overuse of antibiotics, it is likely to develop into anal inflammation.\n5. Eosinophilic condition\nEosinophils are white blood cells produced by the marrow, which are an accurate measure of the health of the human body. Eosinophils play an important role in the immune system, helping to destroy foreign parasites entering the body and regulating the inflammatory response.\nWhen the human body receives any abnormal invasion, eosinophils will destroy cells and fight those harmful bacteria. The normal index of eosinophils is about 50 - 500 cells/mm3.\nHowever, during work, typically regulating the inflammatory response in the human body, eosinophils will accumulate within the rectal mucosa. This phenomenon is the cause of anal inflammation in humans.\n6. Rectal inflammation\nProctitis or rectal mucosal inflammation is a disease with the same etiology and symptoms as anal inflammation. The main cause of this pathogenesis is because of the structure of the digestive system, the rectum and anus are two organs located next to each other. That's why the disease is one of the biggest causes of anal inflammation because inflammation in the rectal mucosa will affect neighboring locations first, specifically the anus.(3)\nNote that some medical centers do not emphasize the distinction between proctitis and anal inflammation. Because these two diseases have the same symptoms, pathogenesis and treatment methods. Therefore, when you are diagnosed with proctitis, it can also be understood that you have anal inflammation.\n7. Overuse of protein foods that cause inflammation\nProtein foods include protein-rich foods or functional foods that are a necessary element in every meal. However, you need to control your protein intake based on your health condition to limit the risk of disease caused by excess protein.\nMilk and dairy products are a typical protein-rich food, appearing in most meals. However, milk is a very high cause of constipation because it affects the production of gas inside the body. For a person who consumes milk and dairy products, the possibility of problems such as cramps and stomach pain is very high. These problems will lead to inconvenience during defecation, causing bleeding in the anus. From there, it affects the health of the rectum and anus, eventually causing anal inflammation in humans.\n\nSymptoms of anal inflammation\nSymptoms of anal inflammation are often confused with hemorrhoids. However, these are two completely different types of diseases. Anal inflammation is identified based on clinical symptoms around the anal area and abnormalities during the patient's defecation process.\nSome symptoms of anal inflammation include:\nRectal bleeding; Mucus in the toilet; Cramping pain in the anus and rectum. The pain will be more intense for people with anal inflammation caused by gonorrhea, herpes simplex and cytomegalovirus; Always having the urge to defecate, needing to go urgently even though the body really doesn't need it; Anal itching and irritation; Tensing\n\nDiagnosis of anal inflammation\n1. Rectal examination\nProctoscopy or proctoscopy is an imaging diagnostic method, used in cases of suspected anal inflammation or colon mucositis.\nWith this method, the doctor will insert an endoscope with a specialized camera into the patient through the anus and deep into the rectum. The camera will show the condition of the mucosa and walls of the anus and rectum. The doctor will make a diagnosis and conclude the disease based on lesions such as ulcers, mucosal bleeding, polyps, etc.\n2. Sigmoidoscopy\nSigmoidoscopy is also a method of inserting endoscopic instruments into the colon through the anus so that doctors can observe and diagnose damage to the colon as well as nearby locations including the rectum and anus. subject.\nThis method is indicated for cases where patients have symptoms of bloody stools, intestinal obstruction, bowel disorders, and severe pain. In addition, people who have signs of anal inflammation but are accompanied by a number of other symptoms, suspected to be affected by other digestive diseases, will also be prescribed a sigmoidoscopy so that the doctor can screen them. better filter and eliminate disease-causing possibilities.\n3. Test for STDs and sexually transmitted diseases\nAnal inflammation can be related to STDs and sexually transmitted diseases, so this test not only helps the doctor diagnose the patient's anal condition but can also identify or rule out the cause. STDs that the patient has, leading to anal inflammation.\nThis test is more of a diagnostic test for sexual diseases, based on the clinical symptoms that the patient currently has. The doctor will prescribe the type of test suitable for the patient. Common methods of testing for STDs include:\nUrine test; Serological testing for syphilis; Test a swab inside the penis in men and the cervix in women\n\nTreatment of anal inflammation – Need to treat the cause\nTreatment of anal inflammation is usually not complicated and can be completely cured. However, the doctor will need to find the cause of the disease to be able to prescribe the optimal treatment regimen and method for the patient.\n1. Anal inflammation due to infection\nAnal inflammation caused by infection or progression from infectious diseases is usually treated medically with oral medications. The doctor will prescribe an antibiotic regimen to kill disease-causing bacteria. Normally, an anal inflammation treatment regimen with antibiotics will last 7-10 days. Patients need to be treated according to the correct antibiotic dosage prescribed by the doctor to completely eliminate bacteria and minimize complications from incorrect antibiotic use.\n2. Anal inflammation due to radiation effects\nSubjects with anal inflammation due to radiation from radiotherapy are often treated with topical medication when the patient has anal bleeding. Medications used to treat topical anal inflammation include foam corticosteroids, sucralfate douches, or hyperbaric oxygen therapy if the patient does not respond to the above treatments.\n3. Endoscopic treatment method\nEndoscopic treatment of anal inflammation is often used while the endoscopist diagnoses the disease. If the endoscopy results detect conditions such as bleeding, the doctor will stop the bleeding right away. Hemostasis can be achieved by laser, electrocautery or heating probe.\n\nPreventive measures for anal inflammation\nAnal inflammation can be easily prevented by building hygienic living habits as well as following a healthy diet. Limiting exposure of the anus or genitals to environments containing pathogenic bacteria can minimize the risk of anal inflammation in humans.\nBesides, you need to eat in a controlled manner almost all the foods and nutrients you put into your body, paying special attention to protein to avoid excess causing irritation in the digestive system. chemistry. This also applies to foods that increase stomach acid secretion such as alcohol, hot spicy foods, etc.\nCenter for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City) and Department of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreatic (Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing High-class, effective examination and treatment services for patients with mild to severe liver problems (fatty liver, acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer...). Tam Anh General Hospital system brings together a team of highly specialized and experienced Internal Medicine - Surgery - Gastrointestinal Endoscopy doctors, in addition to the support of a modern medical equipment system imported from abroad. in addition, serving the maximum examination and treatment needs of customers.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of liver diseases with gastroenterology specialists of Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nAnal inflammation is a form of damage to the lining of the anus or nearby areas. The disease causes symptoms such as bloody stools and pain in the rectum and anus, affecting the patient's quality of life. Anal inflammation is mostly a progression from other digestive diseases that spread downward. In addition, it can also be due to the impact of poor hygiene, causing anal infections. The disease has a simple, short-term treatment method. Patients who only need to follow the doctor's regimen can completely recover from anal inflammation.",
