Among people with sore throat problems, nearly half have pharyngitis. The disease progresses rapidly and has a high recurrence rate, causing patients to frequently face many unpleasant symptoms that affect their quality of life.\n\nWhat is pharyngitis?\nGranulomatous pharyngitis can occur in anyone, especially people with poor resistance\nGranulomatous pharyngitis is a condition in which the pharyngeal mucosa is chronically inflamed, causing the lymphoid tissue in the back of the throat to swell, forming red or pink granules in the pharyngeal mucosa. The size of these seeds can vary in size, from the size of a pin head to a pea.(1)\nGranulomatous pharyngitis appears in all subjects, all ages, and is especially common in people with weak resistance and weakened bodies.\n\nCauses of granular pharyngitis\nGranulomatous pharyngitis can be caused by many causes, including:\nAttack of harmful agents: The oral cavity is frequently exposed to viruses, bacteria or disease-causing fungi. When conditions are favorable, they will attack and cause infection. Normally, the virus will attack first, then bacteria and fungi will continue to invade, causing superinfection. This causes the lymphocytes in the throat area to work continuously, overload and swell.; Attack of harmful agents: The oral cavity is frequently exposed to viruses, bacteria or disease-causing fungi. When conditions are favorable, they will attack and cause infection. Normally, the virus will attack first, then bacteria and fungi will continue to invade, causing superinfection. This causes lymphocytes in the throat area to work continuously, overload and swell.\nPathological complications: Granulomatous pharyngitis can be a complication of chronic rhinosinusitis, recurrent acute pharyngitis, chronic tonsillitis or gastrointestinal diseases such as laryngopharyngeal reflux, etc.; Pathological complications: Granulomatous pharyngitis can be a complication of chronic rhinosinusitis, recurrent acute pharyngitis, chronic tonsillitis or gastrointestinal diseases such as laryngopharyngeal reflux, etc.\nAbnormalities in the anatomical structure of the nose and sinuses: nasal polyps, deviated septum,; Abnormalities in the anatomical structure of the nose and sinuses: nasal polyps, deviated septum,\nPolluted living environment: Frequent exposure to toxic chemicals, dust, cigarette smoke... or erratic weather are also risk factors.; Polluted living environment: Frequent exposure to toxic chemicals, dust, cigarette smoke... or erratic weather are also risk factors.\nUnhealthy lifestyle: Alcohol abuse, hot spicy foods, poor oral hygiene... also contribute to irritating the throat and creating conditions for bad agents to penetrate, causing inflammation.; Unhealthy lifestyle: Alcohol abuse, hot spicy foods, poor oral hygiene... also contribute to irritating the throat and creating conditions for bad agents to penetrate and cause inflammation.\nGenetic and genetic factors: sensitive physical factors, some genetic and immune diseases are also causes of increased risk of pharyngitis.; Genetic and genetic factors: sensitive physical factors, some genetic and immune diseases are also causes of increased risk of pharyngitis.\n\nSymptoms of granular pharyngitis\nGranulomatous pharyngitis causes dry cough, cough with phlegm and many other unpleasant symptoms\nGranulomatous pharyngitis causes notable symptoms, including:(2)\nDry and itchy throat, often having to clear the throat or spit to relieve the itching Appearance of red or pink particles in the throat, protruding higher than the surrounding mucosa Difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, even when swallowing saliva Cough: Dry cough, cough with phlegm Fever, can be higher than 38 degrees Neck lymph nodes are swollen, stiff, painful Fatigue, loss of appetite.; Dry and itchy throat, often having to clear throat or spit to relieve itching; Appearance of red or pink particles in the throat, protruding higher than the surrounding mucosa; Difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, even when swallowing saliva; Cough: Dry cough, cough with phlegm; Fever, possibly higher than 38 degrees; Neck lymph nodes, stiffness, pain; Fatigue, loss of appetite.\n\nClassification of granular pharyngitis\nGranulomatous pharyngitis can be divided into two types: acute and chronic\nAcute pharyngitis: the first time the illness causes little trouble for the patient, leading to being subjective, ignoring or self-medicating. Therefore, when there are suspicious signs, the patient should see an Ear, Nose and Throat doctor for timely treatment, limiting other complications.; Acute pharyngitis: the first time the illness causes little trouble for the patient, leading to being subjective, ignoring or self-medicating. Therefore, when there are suspicious signs, the patient should see an Ear, Nose and Throat doctor for timely treatment to limit other complications.\nChronic pharyngitis: when acute, the patient does not receive proper treatment, leading to prolonged illness. If the illness lasts more than 3 weeks, there will be changes. At that time, treatment will be more difficult, and then it will be easy to relapse.; Chronic pharyngitis: when acute, the patient does not receive proper treatment, leading to prolonged illness. If the illness lasts more than 3 weeks, there will be changes. Then treatment will be more difficult, and then it will easily relapse.\n\nIs pharyngitis dangerous?\nAlthough granular pharyngitis is not too dangerous, it can still lead to many complications, causing discomfort and reducing the patient's quality of life. Common complications include:\nSwelling, abscesses in the throat wall area, tonsillitis Causes inflammation of surrounding areas and respiratory organs, forming sinusitis, otitis media, croup, and even pneumonia. Prolonged illness can cause inflammation of distant organs such as arthritis, glomerulonephritis, pericarditis... In many cases, chronic pharyngitis is a factor that increases the risk of nasopharyngeal cancer in patients. ; Swelling, abscess in the throat wall area, tonsillitis; Causes inflammation in surrounding areas and respiratory organs, forming sinusitis, otitis media, croup, and even pneumonia.; Prolonged illness can cause inflammation of distant organs such as arthritis, glomerulonephritis, pericarditis...; In many cases, chronic pharyngitis is a factor that increases the risk of nasopharyngeal cancer in patients.\n\nDiagnosis of granular pharyngitis\nTo diagnose granular pharyngitis, the doctor will first ask the patient about the symptoms and time of onset of the disease, then will conduct an examination of the patient's ears, nose and throat. The physical manifestations of pharyngitis are relatively clear, so doctors can determine the condition through clinical examination.(3)\nDuring the diagnostic process, the doctor may also prescribe a laryngoscopy to observe the throat mucosa in more detail, thereby making an accurate diagnosis.\nIn cases where pharyngitis is suspected to lead to lower respiratory tract infections or affect other organs, the doctor may ask the patient to perform a chest X-ray, CT scan, MRI... to confirm the diagnosis. guess.\n\nHow to treat granular pharyngitis\nDepending on the cause and inflammation, the doctor will prescribe appropriate treatment methods for the patient.(4)\n1. Treat according to the cause\nIf granular pharyngitis is a complication of another disease, such as chronic sinusitis, rhinitis, tonsillitis, gastroesophageal reflux, etc., the doctor will prioritize completely resolving these diseases first.
