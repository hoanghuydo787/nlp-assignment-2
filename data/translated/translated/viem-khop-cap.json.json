    "content": "Acute arthritis: Causes, signs, treatment, prevention\n\nAcute arthritis is a less common disease but can easily lead to many serious problems if not treated early. This condition comes from many different causes with extremely typical symptoms such as joint pain and swelling, reduced range of motion, fever, etc. The disease needs to be diagnosed and treated promptly to minimize complications. dangerous to health.\n\nWhat is acute arthritis?\nAcute arthritis is a condition of inflammation and pain that begins quickly or suddenly, due to an overactive immune system, leading to multiple joints being attacked at the same time. This medical problem is less common but has the risk of becoming chronic if not diagnosed and treated early.\n\nDifferences between acute arthritis and common arthritis\nUnlike regular arthritis, acute arthritis occurs suddenly and is not caused by injury. Some possible causes of acute joint pain other than arthritis include: bursitis, sprains, gout, inflammation from injury, overuse, etc. Depending on the severity, this condition usually goes away. over several weeks with self-care and conservative treatment. (first)\n\nSigns of acute inflammation\nAcute arthritis often appears with the following signs:\nSwelling, redness and heat in the affected joints.; Range of motion is limited.; Joint pain appears suddenly, after a hearty meal or when the weather changes; It is difficult for patients to distinguish between normal arthritis and acute arthritis. Accordingly, doctors recommend monitoring symptoms and progression of pain at a certain time of day, after physical activity or rest to support accurate diagnosis.; If signs of swelling and pain continue for more than a few weeks, become more serious, or symptoms such as fever, rash, etc. appear, the patient should immediately contact a doctor. Timely diagnosis and treatment will help minimize unwanted complications.\n\nCauses of acute arthritis\nAcute arthritis can appear due to some of the following typical causes: (2)\nViral infection.; Ankylosing spondylitis.; Avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis – bone tissue dies due to limited blood flow).; Bone cancer.; Broken bone.; Bursitis.; Complex regional pain syndrome (chronic pain due to nervous system dysfunction).; Fibromyalgia.; Gonococcal arthritis; Gout (arthritis related to excess uric acid levels).; Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).; Leukemia.; Lupus.; Osteoarthritis.; Osteomyelitis (bone infection).; Rheumatoid arthritis; Pseudogout.; Psoriatic arthritis.; Reactive arthritis.; Rheumatism.; Rickets; Infectious arthritis; Sprain.; Tendonitis.\nRisk factors\nAnyone can develop acute arthritis, but some people may be at higher risk due to the following factors:\nAge.; Family history of the disease; Previous joint damage or trauma.; Experiencing underlying health problems, typically obesity; There are underlying diseases that are unstable and can easily cause reactive arthritis.\n\nWhen to see a doctor\nIf the signs of joint pain and swelling still do not improve in a few weeks, or even become worse or some of the following worrying symptoms appear, the patient should immediately contact a doctor:\nSevere swelling, redness, and heat in the joints; Rash with purple spots; Sores appear in the mouth, nose or genitals; Chest pain, difficulty breathing; Severe cough.; Stomach-ache.; Fever.; Sweating, chills; Weight loss.; Sore or red eyes.\n\nDiagnostic method\nFor acute arthritis, the doctor will initially ask a number of questions about your medical symptom history, including: (4)\nSeverity of pain.; Type of pain onset (sudden, gradual...).; Changes in symptoms over time, factors that increase or decrease pain (rest, exercise...).; Joint swelling, stiffness or other previously diagnosed disorders; Risk of exposure to sexually transmitted diseases.\nThe doctor will then proceed to prescribe a complete physical examination, including:\nCheck for swelling, redness, heat, and pain of joints (including spinal joints).; Check for noise when the joint moves.; Range of motion of joints.; Check the eyes, mouth, nose, and genital area for sores or other signs of infection.; Nervous system function tests to detect muscle or nerve disorders.\nNext, the doctor may prescribe the following tests:\nJoint fluid test: If the joint is swollen, the doctor will take the joint fluid for testing (a procedure called arthrocentesis or arthrocentesis. Accordingly, the sampling site will be anesthetized to limit sensation). pain for the patient. The doctor will take joint fluid to check for signs of infection, gout or some related disorders based on the number of white blood cells.; Antibody test: This test can help detect a some autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus erythematosus.; Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and CRP test: ESR is a test that measures the rate at which white blood cells settle to the bottom of a test tube containing a blood sample. The higher the rate, the greater the rate of systemic inflammation. However, the test is easily affected by age and anemia, so the results are sometimes inaccurate. At this time, CRP will continue to be prescribed.; Test Imaging tests: Imaging tests help detect bone or joint tumors (if any). Accordingly, doctors often prescribe X-rays, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). ).\n\nSymptoms\nAcute arthritis usually improves after a few weeks or months. However, some cases that are not treated promptly have the risk of serious progression over time, leading to chronicity with many dangerous complications as follows:\nDestruction of bones and cartilage: Inflamed joints can affect muscles, tendons, and ligaments, causing bones and joints to weaken. In particular, the disease can also cause inflammation of the joint capsule, reducing the quality of joint fluid. This causes joint cartilage to lack nutrients and gradually become dry and flaky. The bone under the cartilage also has different solid and hollow areas, leading to constant pain; Joint deformity: As the disease progresses, tumors will appear in the inflamed joint area. The joint cannot keep its original shape, becomes rough, or even shifts to one side, affecting mobility.\n\nHow to treat acute arthritis\nTreatment for acute arthritis will depend on the cause and severity of the disease, specifically as follows:\nReactive arthritis, due to inflammation in neighboring organs, causing an inflammatory reaction in the joints: in that case, the root cause needs to be treated, for example, people with gonorrhea infections in the joints need antibiotics.; Non-inflammatory pain: In this case, acetaminophen is often prescribed, joint immobilization with splints, hot and cold compresses are used to relieve pain.; Once the acute pain subsides, physical therapy may be prescribed to improve range of motion and strengthen surrounding muscles. In cases that have progressed to chronicity, the key treatment is ongoing physical activity to prevent muscle loss and permanent joint stiffness.\n\nHow to prevent acute arthritis\nAcute arthritis can be effectively prevented through a number of scientific diet and lifestyle changes. (4)\n1. Diet\nBuild a diet rich in Omega-3, including: fish (salmon, tuna, sardines...), nuts (flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts...), vegetable oils (seed oils) canola, soybean oil...), yogurt, eggs... Supplement food groups that are good for bones, help build bones, strengthen bones, increase bone density, including: low-fat milk, broccoli, tea green, citrus…\n2. Physical activity\nRegular physical activity is one of the useful measures to prevent arthritis. Accordingly, experts recommend moderate exercise for 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week to strengthen muscles, bones, and joints.\n3. Manage weight at a reasonable level\nBeing overweight puts pressure on the hips and knees, contributing to the destruction of cartilage in the joint cushions. Therefore, maintaining a reasonable weight is really necessary to effectively prevent common arthritis.\nIn addition, controlling blood sugar at a stable level and giving up smoking habits are also useful solutions that should be prioritized.\n4. Control chronic diseases\nIf the patient has chronic diseases such as cardiovascular, endocrine, or cancer, they need to be periodically monitored and well controlled to prevent reactive arthritis.\nCenter for Orthopedic Trauma, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is where a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons gather such as: TTND.Prof.Dr.Nguyen Viet Tien; Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa; Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh; MSc.BS.CKII Tran Anh Vu; BS.CKI Tran Xuan Anh, MSc.CKI Le Dinh Khoa, PhD.Do Tien Dung; Dr. BS.CKII Vu Huu Dung... This is also one of the pioneer units in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal diseases with modern techniques according to updated international protocols.\nThe hospital is also equipped with modern machinery and imaging equipment such as: Somatom Drive 768-slice CT scanner, new generation Magnetom Amira BioMatrix magnetic resonance machine, Artis Pheno robot, densitometer. bones, ultrasound machines...; Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss surgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table... to be able to detect injuries early and effectively treat musculoskeletal diseases...\nTam Anh General Hospital also owns a spacious clinic system and high-class boarding area; modern rehabilitation area; Comprehensive post-operative care process helps patients quickly recover and stabilize their health after surgery.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Orthopedics Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nAbove is a summary of all useful information related to acute arthritis. Hopefully with these shares, patients can have many new updates in prevention, detection and timely treatment, helping to minimize unwanted complications.",
