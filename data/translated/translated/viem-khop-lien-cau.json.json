    "content": "Streptococcal arthritis: Causes, signs, treatment and prevention\n\nStreptococcal arthritis is a very rare bone and joint disease. However, the disease has a major negative impact on the health and life of patients. Therefore, as soon as you notice symptoms of the disease, you should quickly go for examination and treatment to prevent dangerous complications.\n\nWhat is streptococcal arthritis?\nStreptococcus bacteria are bacteria that exist on the skin and mucous membranes of the human body. When the body is in a healthy state, this bacteria will not cause harm. However, if resistance is reduced, streptococcus will find every way to penetrate inside the body. At that time, they combine with other types of bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus, blue pus bacillus... to attack the joints, damage and inflame the joints, causing streptococcal arthritis. (first)\nSee more: What is arthritis?\nThe culprit causing the disease is Streptococcus bacteria\n\nIs streptococcal arthritis dangerous?\nStreptococcal arthritis can progress very quickly. When not detected and treated promptly, patients can face serious complications such as: (2)\nJoint damage: bacteria attack all joint structures, corroding cartilage and bones and can cause loss of function, hindering the patient's life and health.; Damage to organs: through the bloodstream, bacteria can move into internal organs, causing infections, systemic infections, which can endanger the patient's life.\n\nThe cause to the illness\nStreptococcal arthritis often appears after damage to the skin or some nearby organs or sepsis. The main causes of the disease are: (3)\nMechanical agents: skin damage, joint injury, open joint capsule tears will create conditions for bacteria from the outside to penetrate the joint.; Infections appear next to the joints such as boils, tendonitis, muscle inflammation, bone inflammation, urinary tract infections, digestive tract infections or genital infections near the joints... These are factors that directly affect development. streptococcal arthritis; The patient has had arthrocentesis or joint injection procedures performed without proper technique or sterility.; Due to infections in other organs such as pneumonia or sepsis, bacteria travel through the bloodstream to the joints.\nIn addition, the disease is also common in subjects such as:\nPeople with poor resistance and are susceptible to infections such as children, pregnant women, and the elderly.; People with diabetes; People with malnutrition; People with bone and joint diseases such as joint injuries, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.\n\n4. Signs and symptoms of the disease\nPatients with streptococcal arthritis will have symptoms such as: (4)\nSymptoms in joints: Patients often have pain in infected joints, especially hip joints, knee joints, shoulder joints, wrist joints, elbow joints... Accompanying symptoms are inflammation, swelling, heat, and some redness. In cases where pus may leak. Inflamed joints often have severe, continuous pain, which increases with movement; Whole body symptoms: Patients often have high fever of about 39°C - 40°C, chills, weight loss, fatigue, dirty tongue, dry skin...; Extra-articular symptoms: Swollen lymph nodes at the corresponding inflammation site, some signs of initial infection may appear.\n\nHow to prevent streptococcal arthritis?\nYou should proactively take disease prevention measures such as: (5)\nIt is necessary to thoroughly treat infections when they appear, especially skin and soft tissue infections. Regularly exercise to improve the immune system and increase bone and joint flexibility; You should visit reputable medical facilities to receive appropriate antibiotics, perform drainage, arthroscopic lavage, and correct surgical techniques to limit the risk of serious infection causing joint destruction.; When you have a joint injury, you should actively treat and clean the wound according to your doctor's instructions. This will help prevent the risk of joint infections.; Develop a scientific diet to avoid uncontrolled weight gain and obesity. When you control your weight well, the pressure on your joints will be significantly reduced.\n\nDiagnosis of streptococcal arthritis\nClinical diagnosis\nPeople with streptococcal arthritis need to provide complete information about their current condition as well as the progression of the disease from the beginning and medical history. These are important data that help doctors make an accurate diagnosis.\nTest\nBlood tests: Doctors check the number of polymorphonuclear white blood cells, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, pro-calcitonin.; Joint fluid test: The doctor punctures the joint to do cell count, gram stain, and pus culture to look for bacteria. Color and odor characteristics of joint fluid can also suggest a bacterial joint infection.\nBlood culture\nThe doctor will take a blood sample from the patient and culture the bacteria. Thereby, doctors can identify the strain of disease-causing bacteria traveling in the blood to come up with an appropriate treatment plan.\nDiagnosis by imaging\nThe doctor may prescribe X-rays, ultrasound or MRI to determine the location and extent of damage to the joint.\nThe process of diagnosing the disease is relatively more complicated than diagnosing common bone and joint diseases. However, once the correct bacterial strain and level of joint damage have been determined, treatment will no longer be too difficult.\n\nMethods of treating arthritis caused by streptococcus\nTreatment regimen\nMedical treatment: The disease is initially treated with empirical intravenous antibiotics. Then, depending on the results of bacterial culture, antibiogram (checking the level of drug resistance of bacteria), and disease progression, the duration of antibiotic use, as well as the type of amenorrhea, can be changed.; Arthroscopy, aspiration and drainage: In addition to antibiotic treatment, the doctor may prescribe drainage of joint pus, joint lavage, etc.; Surgical treatment: In cases of severe infection, damaged joints and bones, the doctor may consider prescribing bone removal surgery, placing biological cement, etc.\nSome measures to combine treatment with antibiotics: Pain relief, fever reduction with paracetamol, anti-inflammatory combination when there are symptoms of severe pain and high fever. Provides adequate nutrition for the body as well as controls existing chronic diseases.\nCenter for Orthopedic Trauma, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is where a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons gather such as: TTND.Prof.Dr.Nguyen Viet Tien; Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa; Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh; MSc. Tran Anh Vu; Dr. Tran Xuan Anh, Dr. Le Dinh Khoa, Dr. Do Tien Dung; Dr. BS.CKII Vu Huu Dung...
