    "content": "Finger arthritis: Causes, signs, treatment and prevention\n\nFinger arthritis is a relatively common disease. The disease occurs for many reasons, causing difficulty for the patient in daily activities due to pain and joint deformity. Treatment will help you shorten recovery time and prevent dangerous complications such as joint deformity, paralysis, etc.\n\nWhat is finger arthritis?\nFinger arthritis is a condition that can occur in any finger such as the thumb joint, the little finger joint... This disease is a condition in which the cartilage at the ends of the bones that form the finger joints wears out or degenerates. , which happened slowly over many years.\nWhen inflammation leads to osteoarthritis of the hands and fingers, the cartilage covering the ends of the bones is reduced in quality. The cartilage surface becomes rough. The bones then rub against each other, which can lead to joint damage. Joint damage can lead to the growth of new bones along the sides of existing bones (bone spurs) or create bumps on the patient's finger joints. (first)\nSee more: What is arthritis?\n\n2. Classify types of inflammation in finger joints\nOsteoarthritis\nThis is the most common type of finger arthritis. The cartilage layer gradually degenerates (erodes) and exposes the bone under the joint. The joints directly affected are: (2)\nProximal interphalangeal joint (PIP joint); DIP joint; Joint at the base of the thumb\nRheumatoid arthritis\nRheumatoid arthritis arises due to autoimmune disease. When sick, the soft tissues around the joints tend to become inflamed and swollen. The joint most affected is the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP).\nGout\nGout occurs when the body cannot metabolize uric acid properly. These molecules will gradually accumulate, forming crystals inside the joint. Joints will become inflamed and swollen, causing pain and reducing the patient's range of motion. Although this disease mainly affects the legs, in some cases, the finger joints can also be affected.\n\nSigns of finger arthritis\nFinger joint pain\nThis is the first and most common symptom. Pain may appear at the base of the finger when holding or grasping an object or using force with the fingers. Initially, the pain only appears when the patient holds an object. With activity, the pain will lessen. After a few minutes of rest, stiffness and pain will increase. If the inflammation is more severe, pain in the finger joints may appear even when you rest.\nFinger deformities\nAs the disease progresses, in addition to increased pain, the patient's fingers also tend to deform. The knuckles begin to point in one direction (towards the little finger). This is a phenomenon of deviation towards the ulna, causing pain and weakness in the hand. Patients have many difficulties using their hands in daily activities.\nInterphalangeal joint deformity\nThis is a condition in which the interphalangeal joints are flexed or hyperextended, creating characteristic deformities. Swan neck deformity occurs when the proximal interphalangeal joints are loose and hyperextended, while the distal interphalangeal joints are flexed. Boutonniere deformity is a condition in which the proximal interphalangeal joints are flexed and the distal interphalangeal joints are extended.\nSwelling of interphalangeal joints\nThe proximal interphalangeal joints are enlarged on the posterior surface, causing swelling and pain, forming Bouchard spots. The distal interphalangeal joints are swollen, forming Heberden's nodules.\nIn addition, inflamed finger joints also have a number of other symptoms such as swelling, stiffness, warmth, pain at the base of the finger, reduced grip strength, reduced range of motion, and the joint at the base of the finger becomes enlarged or looks different. see a bone.\n\nCauses of finger arthritis\nAging: Finger arthritis often occurs with aging. As you get older, the aging process occurs, causing bones, joints, and cartilage to weaken, increasing the risk of finger osteoarthritis.; Injury: Previous injuries such as severe sprains, fractures or finger joint injuries can affect the joint cartilage, causing changes in joint activity. When damage causes the joint to change its arrangement and movement, force will increase on the surface of the joint cartilage, gradually destroying the joint cartilage. Because articular cartilage does not have the ability to heal itself well, the injury will become more and more serious, and signs of finger osteoarthritis will appear.\nIn addition, there are a number of factors that increase the risk of finger arthritis such as:\nFemale; Over 40 years old; Overweight, obesity; Some genetic conditions: Loose joint ligaments, deformed joints...; Suffering from diseases that change the normal structure and function of articular cartilage; Activities and jobs that put pressure on the fingers\n\nDiagnostic method\nClinical examination\nDuring the examination, the doctor will ask the patient about medical history, symptoms and directly examine signs of swelling on the finger joints. In addition, the doctor will hold the patient's joint steady while moving the finger. If movements make sounds or cause pain, this condition is likely to have worn away cartilage, causing bones to rub against each other.\nX-ray\nX-rays help doctors identify signs of finger arthritis including:\nBone spurs; Cartilage wear; Loss of common space; Through X-ray results, the doctor determines the changes in the joint, the degree of osteoarthritis caused by inflammation and estimates the amount of articular cartilage on the joint surface.\n\nSymptoms\nWhether painful and swollen finger joints are dangerous or not will depend on the causative factors and the current severity of the disease. Regardless of the cause of finger arthritis, if not treated promptly, it can lead to dangerous hand complications including: (3)\nTemporary loss of motor function; Joint stiffness; Muscle atrophy and joint deformity; Disabled\n\nTreatment of finger arthritis\nTreatment is non-surgical\nIn the early stages, treatment of finger arthritis mainly uses non-surgical methods including:\n1. Take oral medication\nWhen finger joints only hurt when working a lot or doing heavy work, the doctor will prescribe the patient to use pain relievers and anti-inflammatory drugs. In addition, patients also need to limit heavy activities or stop doing work that requires repetitive movements of the hands and fingers. This will help control symptoms better.\n2. Use injections\nPlatelet-rich plasma stimulates epithelial cells, creates matrix, divides cells, regenerates blood cells, stimulates blood vessel development, thereby supporting the regeneration of damaged tissues, helping cells stay healthy. stronger. For musculoskeletal injuries, the effect of platelet-rich plasma is anti-inflammatory, quickly stops pain, and improves mobility for muscles and joints.\n3. Cortisone\nThe doctor may prescribe the patient to inject Cortisone (a strong anti-inflammatory drug) into the finger joint to temporarily relieve pain. The effects of the drug are temporary, lasting only a few weeks to a few months. This procedure also comes with the risk of joint infection.\n4. Physical therapy\nPhysical therapy exercises play an important role when patients undergo medical treatment. The goal of these exercises is to help patients control symptoms well and maintain stability for the hands and joints.\nPhysical therapists will guide you on how to relieve pain and symptoms through methods such as rest, pain relief with heat, and the use of topical medications. Range of motion and muscle tension exercises will help patients improve finger mobility. Exercises to increase hand and arm strength help stabilize the hand and protect fingers from shock or pressure.\n5. Elastic bandage or finger splint\nThis is a treatment method that helps reduce pain, properly position the joint, prevent joint deformity, and help the joint rest. Patients can wear the brace at night or wear it all day if they do not feel any obstacles in their work or daily activities.\nTreatment includes surgical intervention\nWhen finger arthritis is severe, medical treatment methods are not effective. The doctor may recommend that the patient undergo surgery. Commonly used surgical methods in the treatment of finger arthritis include:\n6. Bone welding\nThis is a treatment method that aims to eliminate pain by allowing the bones that make up the joint to grow toward each other or fuse together to form a solid bone mass. Bone fusion is effective in treating pain and joint deformity caused by degenerative inflammation.\nThis method is often used for the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints, and is more effective than trying to maintain finger joint movement by replacing the joint. Although bone fusion helps relieve pain in that joint, it will cause loss of movement.\n7. Artificial joint replacement\nWhen performing artificial joint replacement, doctors use plastic or metal artificial joints to replace inflamed joints. The replaced joint will form a new hinge, allowing the joint to move freely, while reducing pain for the patient.\n\nPreventive measures for finger arthritis\nExercise regularly: Patients need to regularly perform moderate exercise. This good habit will help you increase your resistance, reduce joint pain and stiffness, and support better blood circulation in your joints.; Don't let your hands work too much: You should take time to rest when you work with your hands too much. This will help patients prevent the risk of finger arthritis.; Keep your body warm: When the weather gets cold, you should pay attention to keeping your body warm to reduce joint pain and stiffness.; Proper handling of stiff finger joints: When stiff finger joints, patients can gently massage or use anti-inflammatory gel to improve this condition, avoiding it affecting daily activities.; Building a healthy diet: You should supplement your menu with food groups rich in calcium, iron, zinc, selenium, vitamins, minerals... Patients need to avoid greasy and spicy foods. Hot, containing stimulants, will affect the body's resistance.\nCenter for Orthopedic Trauma, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is where a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons gather such as: TTND.Prof.Dr.Nguyen Viet Tien; Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa; Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh; MSc.
