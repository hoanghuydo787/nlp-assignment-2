    "content": "Septic arthritis: Causes, signs, treatment, prevention\n\nSeptic arthritis is an inflammation in the joints caused directly by bacteria. This is a common disease in infants and the elderly. The disease needs to be treated early to prevent serious complications such as sepsis, joint adhesions, osteoarthritis, osteoarthritis, etc.\n\nWhat is septic arthritis?\nSeptic arthritis or joint infection, septic arthritis is an infection inside the joint due to bacteria entering the joint, causing swelling and joint pain. Septic arthritis rarely appears in multiple joints at the same time. Infection can occur from germs traveling through the bloodstream from another part of the body. (first)\nJoint infections can also come from a trans-articular injury that brings germs directly into the joint. Joints that are often susceptible to infection are the knee joint, hip joint, wrist joint, elbow joint, shoulder joint and ankle joint.\nTreatment will include draining the joint fluid with a needle or surgery. To treat the infection, your doctor may use antibiotics. In severe cases of infection, the joint can be destroyed, possibly requiring joint replacement surgery.\n\nSigns of infectious arthritis\nWhen suffering from infectious arthritis, the patient will feel sharp pain and difficulty moving the affected joints. Some signs of this inflammatory condition are:\nFever; Feeling sharp pain in the inflamed joint, especially when moving the joint; Inflamed joints will be swollen and red; Warmth and heat appear at the inflamed joint\nAdditional symptoms in children with septic arthritis include:\nLoss of appetite, loss of appetite; Unstable physical condition; Heart beats fast; Always feel uncomfortable and cry\nJoints that are often inflamed and infected depend on each individual: (2)\nAdults: The joints of the arms and legs, especially the knees, are easily affected; Children: Most hip joints are likely to be affected.; Some rare cases: Some people may develop infected joints in the neck, back and head.\n\nCauses of infectious arthritis\nThe cause of joint inflammation is bacteria, viruses or fungi. The bacteria staphylococcus aureus (staph) is the leading culprit causing the disease. This bacteria can live on normal, healthy skin. (3)\nSeptic arthritis can occur after an infection in the body, such as a skin infection or urinary tract infection, spreads through the blood to the joints. Some less common causes of the disease are penetrating injuries, after drug injections or after surgery in or near the joint.\nThe resistance of the joint synovial membrane is relatively weak and cannot prevent the risk of attack by pathogens. The body's reaction when under attack from agents (inflammatory response) has the ability to increase pressure in the joint, reduce blood flow to the joint, thereby making the damage worse.\nSome common causes of the disease are due to abnormal changes in the joints such as:\nJoint injuries; Other forms of arthritis; Immune system deficiency caused by other diseases such as diabetes, kidney disease or cancer and specific medications to treat these diseases; Have ever had an artificial joint implant\nSome risk factors for septic arthritis include:\nExisting joint problems: Conditions and diseases related to the joints (osteoarthritis, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, artificial joints, joint injuries, joint surgery...) may increase the risk. muscles cause joint inflammation; Using drugs to treat rheumatoid arthritis: People with rheumatoid arthritis will face the risk of infectious arthritis. Because the drugs used to treat this disease can inhibit the activity of the immune system, making infections more likely to occur.; Unhealthy skin: Weak, lifeless skin will create favorable conditions for bacteria to enter the body. Dermatological diseases such as psoriasis, eczema... increase the risk of joint infection; Weak immune system: People with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of developing septic arthritis. Among them, patients with diabetes, liver and kidney diseases, and are using drugs that suppress the immune system to treat diseases are in the high-risk group.; Joint injuries: Animal bites, wounds through joints or cuts through joints are high risks for you to develop septic arthritis.\n\nHow is infectious arthritis diagnosed?\nTo diagnose septic arthritis, patients may be prescribed tests including: (4)\nJoint fluid testing: Infection can potentially lead to joint changes in color, consistency, volume and composition. Joint fluid is aspirated from the inflamed joint and sent for testing. Test results will help the doctor determine whether the joint is infected or not, and what type of bacteria it is infected with, thereby orienting the appropriate treatment process.; Blood test: Results from this test can identify signs of infection.; Imaging diagnosis: X-rays and other imaging techniques for inflamed joints will assist in accurately assessing the condition.\n\nComplications of infectious arthritis\nIf not treated promptly, arthritis can cause degenerative joint disease and permanent joint damage. Some complications of the disease include:\nOsteoarthritis; Joint deformity; When inflammation is severe, the joints may require reconstructive surgery\n\nHow to treat infectious arthritis?\n1. Use antibiotics\nSeptic arthritis is often diagnosed and treated early with antibiotics. The doctor will rely on the test results to choose an antibiotic capable of killing the bacteria causing arthritis.\nThe patient will be injected with antibiotics intravenously to ensure that the inflamed joint quickly receives medicine to kill bacteria, then antibiotics will be administered orally. Most symptoms will improve within about 48 hours of the first antibiotic treatment. Treatment usually lasts 2 - 6 weeks.\nSide effects of antibiotics can include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Therefore, patients need to discuss with their doctor in advance about unwanted side effects from treatment medications.\n2. Joint fluid drainage\nYour doctor may need to remove synovial fluid from the infected joint if the infection re-releases the fluid too quickly. Draining infected fluid from the joint helps remove bacteria from the joint, relieves pressure on the joint, and provides the doctor with a sample to test for bacteria and other organisms. The common method of synovial fluid removal is through arthroscopy.\n3. Other treatment options\nAspiration of inflamed joint fluid can be performed using an arthroscopic needle. This treatment can be repeated every day until there are no bacteria left in the joint fluid. If infectious arthritis occurs in the hip joint, the patient may need open surgery to drain the fluid. In some cases, surgery can be performed multiple times to ensure 100% removal of bacteria from joint fluid.\nOnce the infection is under control, the patient may be encouraged to move gently to maintain joint function. Light movement will help prevent joint stiffness and muscle weakness. In addition, movement also supports blood circulation, helping the recovery process progress faster.\n\nAbility to recover after treatment\nInfectious arthritis can be completely treated when the patient proactively visits the doctor early. Most patients will notice a gradual improvement in symptoms within about 48 hours after starting treatment. If not treated promptly and properly, infectious arthritis can cause permanent joint damage. Therefore, as soon as patients feel pain and swelling in their joints, they need to go to the hospital for diagnosis and quick treatment.\n\nPrevention of infectious arthritis\nThere is no way to prevent all risks of septic arthritis. Practicing absolute asepsis when performing procedures and joint surgery is the most effective prevention method. In addition, you also need to completely treat other types of infections in the body such as skin, soft tissue and bones.\nOrthopedic Trauma Center, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is home to a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons such as: TTND.Prof.Dr. Nguyen Viet Tien, Associate Professor Dang Hong Hoa, Associate Professor Tang Ha Nam Anh, Associate Professor Tran Anh Vu, Associate Professor Do Tien Dung, Associate Professor Vu Huu Dung... This is also one of the pioneering units. in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal diseases with modern techniques according to the world's leading advanced protocols\nThe hospital is also equipped with a system of modern machinery and imaging equipment such as: Somatom Drive 768-slice CT scanner, new generation magnetic resonance machine Magnetom Amira BioMatrix, bone density measuring machine, ultrasound machine. minus…; Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss surgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table... to be able to detect injuries early and successfully surgically treat musculoskeletal diseases...\nTam Anh General Hospital also owns a spacious clinic system and high-class boarding area; modern rehabilitation area; Comprehensive post-operative care process helps patients quickly recover and stabilize their health after surgery.\nTo schedule an appointment for arthritis examination and treatment with leading experts at the Orthopedics Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nInfectious arthritis, when treated promptly, will help preserve intact joint function and prevent permanent joint destruction. One of the important factors that help the treatment process be highly effective is prompt care, drainage and use of appropriate antibiotics to quickly completely destroy disease-causing bacteria.",
