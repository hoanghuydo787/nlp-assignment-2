    "content": "Corneal ulcers: Causes, symptoms and prevention\n\nThe cornea is the outer, transparent layer at the front of the eye and is also the most vulnerable part of the eye area. Corneal ulcers occur when there is damage such as scratches or tears in the cornea due to contact with dust, soil, sand... If corneal ulcers occur for a long time, they will cause serious eye complications.\n\nWhat are corneal ulcers?\nA corneal ulcer is an eye infection that causes open sores on the cornea. Symptoms and complications vary depending on the disease and the causative agent.\nSlight contact from dust, soil, rubbing eyes... is the cause of corneal ulcers\n\nReason\nCorneal ulcers can be caused by bacterial, fungal, viral or parasitic infections such as Acanthamoeba (which live in contaminated water).; Ulcers may begin with trauma to the cornea, such as severe dry eyes, foreign objects scratching, penetrating, or if the eyes become irritated by contact lenses, especially contact lens wear. during sleep or without adequate disinfection.; Viral corneal ulcers (usually herpesvirus) may recur due to physical stress or may recur spontaneously.; Vitamin A and protein deficiencies can lead to the formation of corneal ulcers.; When the eyelids do not close properly, the cornea can become dry and irritated. This type of irritation can lead to injury and the development of corneal ulcers.; Corneal ulcers can also be caused by ingrown eyelashes, inward eyelids (entropion, droopy hair) or blepharitis.; Some diseases such as poorly controlled diabetes... are also risk factors for corneal ulcers.\n\nSymptom\nCorneal ulcers cause redness, pain, feeling like there is a foreign object in the eye, pain, sensitivity to bright light and increased tear production.; The ulcer usually appears as a white or fuzzy and gray spot on the cornea. Sometimes, ulcers develop over the entire cornea and can go deep. Pus can accumulate behind the cornea, sometimes forming a white layer at the base of the cornea (called anterior chamber pus).; The conjunctiva is often bloodshot; The deeper the ulcer, the more severe the symptoms and complications.\n\nSymptoms\nIf keratitis is not treated early and properly, complications can occur:\nCorneal ulcers can heal after treatment, but they can leave opaque scars that reduce vision.; Other complications may include deep infection, corneal perforation, and displacement of the iris\nIn cases where the cornea is seriously damaged, a corneal transplant procedure may be used. However, it is necessary to find a corneal donor and the cost of a corneal transplant is quite high.\n\nDiagnose\nDoctors evaluate the ulcer using a slit lamp (an instrument that allows the doctor to examine the eye under high magnification). To see the ulcer clearly, your doctor may apply eye drops containing a dye called fluorescein. The fluorescein temporarily stains damaged areas of the cornea, allowing the doctor to see damaged areas of the cornea that otherwise would not be visible.\nModern machines and techniques help check eye problems for patients\nIn some situations, the doctor will scrape the surface of large ulcers to obtain a sample. The sample is then cultured to identify the bacteria, fungi, viruses or parasites causing the infection. Once the organism is identified, doctors will choose the best medication to treat it.\n\nTreatment\nA corneal ulcer is an emergency that requires immediate treatment.; Antibiotic, antiviral or antifungal eye drops are often needed immediately and must be applied regularly, sometimes hourly for several days.; Dilating eye drops, such as atropine or scopolamine, may help relieve pain and reduce the risk of complications.; Corneal transplant\n\nPrevention of corneal ulcers\nTo prevent or limit the risk of keratitis, especially for people who regularly wear contact lenses, you should:\nReplace contact lenses on time; Do not expose yourself to direct sunlight by wearing eye protection when going out; Do not sleep while wearing contact lenses; Contact lenses should be removed when swimming; Before wearing or removing contact lenses, wash your hands thoroughly; Use glass cleaning solution, do not replace it with water or dilute the solution; Treatment to stabilize the underlying disease\n\nIs corneal ulcer dangerous?\nIf corneal ulcers are not treated early and properly, complications such as corneal scarring, chronic inflammation, corneal perforation, etc. can occur.\nThrough the images obtained, the doctor will advise on appropriate ways to overcome and treat the condition\nTherefore, you should not ignore the symptoms, go to an eye specialist for accurate diagnosis and timely treatment before complications arise.\n\nShould eye drops be used when suffering from corneal ulcers?\nThe use of eye drops for ulcerative keratitis requires clearly identifying the cause. If the cause is infection, the doctor will prescribe eye drops such as antibiotic, antifungal, antiviral eye drops and possibly anti-inflammatory eye drops.\nPatients need to absolutely follow the doctor's instructions to use the right dose, at the right time, and in the right combination to achieve high treatment effectiveness and avoid complications.\nThe Eye Clinic at Tam Anh General Hospital System is equipped with modern machinery and equipment and a team of highly qualified doctors and nurses that will help protect your eyes and prevent eye diseases. To register for medical examination, you can come directly for examination or contact to schedule an appointment through the hotline number: 0287 102 6789 (HCMC) and 024 3872 3872 (Hanoi).\nTo schedule an appointment to see MSc.
