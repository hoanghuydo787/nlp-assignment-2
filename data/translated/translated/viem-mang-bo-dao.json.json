    "content": "Uveitis: Causes, symptoms and treatments\n\nWith characteristics such as the ability to cause blindness, the disease occurs in all ages and the cause is especially unknown, making uveitis a dangerous disease that directly threatens the vision of anyone. Who.\n\nWhat is uveitis?\nAccording to the structure of the eye, the uvea consists of three parts: the iris, ciliary body and choroid. This is also where many blood vessels are located, including veins and arteries that carry blood to nourish the eyes.\nPeritonitis occurs in all ages\nUveitis is inflammation anywhere in the pigmented layer inside the eye (uvea). The disease can affect the lens, retina, and optic nerves. (first)\n\nStructure of the uvea\nThe uvea consists of three structures: the iris, the ciliary body, and the choroid.\nIris: colored ring around the black pupil, which opens and closes to let more or less light into the eye, like a shutter in a camera.; Ciliary body: is a collection of muscles that, by contracting, allows the lens to become thicker so the eye can focus on nearby objects. When dilated, the ciliary muscle helps the lens become thinner so the eye can focus on distant objects. This process is called regulation.; Choroid: extends from the edge of the ciliary body to the optic nerve at the back of the eye. The choroid is located between the retina on the inside and the sclera on the outside. The choroid contains both pigment cells and blood vessels that nourish the inside parts of the eye, especially the retina.\n\nClassification of uveitis\nPart or all of the uvea may become inflamed. Inflammation limited to a part of the uvea is named according to its location:\nAnterior uveitis is inflammation of the front of the uvea, including the iris.; Intermediate uveitis is inflammation in the middle of the uvea and often involves the egg white-like substance that fills the eyeball (called vitreous bodies).; Posterior uveitis is inflammation of the posterior part of the uvea and may involve the retina and choroid.; Panuveitis is an inflammatory condition that affects the entire uvea.\nAmong the 4 types of uveitis, 3 types of inflammation, namely middle, posterior and total uveitis, can cause more dangerous complications than anterior uveitis.\nSometimes uveitis is called by the name of the specific area affected by iridocyclitis, choroiditis, etc. Uveitis is limited to one eye in many people, but can involve both eyes. .\n\nCauses of uveitis in the eye\nCauses of uveitis may be limited to the eyes or due to disorders that affect the entire body including the eyes. Most people with the disease have no identifiable cause (called idiopathic uveitis or uveitis of unknown cause).\nRed eyes due to uveitis are different from pink eye in that the edge of the black eye is also red\nMany people with uveitis have organ disorders elsewhere in the body. These include inflammatory diseases, such as Behçet syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, sarcoidosis, reactive arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis ), Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease.\nSome people have widespread infections, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, or Lyme disease.\nOther possible causes include infections that may only affect the eyes, such as herpes infections (caused by the herpes simplex virus), shingles (caused by the varicella-zoster virus), toxoplasmosis, and cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus mainly occurs in people with compromised immune systems, such as people infected with the HIV virus or people taking drugs that suppress the immune system.\nEye trauma is a common cause of anterior uveitis.\nAlthough rare, some drugs (such as pamidronate, rifabutin, sulfonamide antibiotics, cidofovir) can cause uveitis. (2)\n\nEye symptoms of uveitis\nInitial symptoms of uveitis can be mild or severe, depending on which part of the uvea is affected.\nThe disease can cause impaired vision and abnormal dark spots\nAnterior uveitis: Severe pain in the eyes, red eyes, more pain when exposed to bright light and decreased vision are typical symptoms. The doctor may see prominent blood vessels on the surface of the eye near the edge of the cornea, cells floating in the front part of the eye (aqueous humor), and deposits on the inner surface of the cornea.\nIntermediate uveitis is usually painless. Vision may be reduced and the patient may see unusual dark spots (floaters).\nPosterior uveitis often causes vision loss and floaters. The optic nerve can become inflamed, causing vision loss, which can vary from a small blind spot to total blindness.\nPanuveitis can combine these symptoms. (3)\nUveitis can quickly damage the eye. It can cause long-term, sight-threatening complications, such as macular edema, retinal damage, glaucoma and cataracts. Many people have just one episode of uveitis, others have periodic recurrences over months to years or chronic inflammation that requires long-term treatment.\n\nHow to treat uveitis\nTreatment for uveitis must start early to prevent permanent damage. Treatment almost always includes corticosteroids, usually given as eye drops. Corticosteroids can also be taken orally or injected into or around the eyes. Mydriatic medications, such as homatropine or cyclopentolate drops, are also used.\nOther medications may be used to treat specific causes of uveitis. For example, if the cause is an infection, medication can be used to eliminate the infectious organism. (4)",
