    "content": "Iritis of the ciliary body: Causes, symptoms and treatment\n\nIritis is the most common uveitis. So what is iridocyclitis, what are the causes, symptoms, treatments and prevention?\n\nWhat is iridocyclitis?\nCiliary iridocyclitis is an inflammation of the anterior part of the uvea (iris), also known as anterior uveitis. The disease is most common in the form of uveitis. [first]\nSpecifically, the uvea is the layer between the retina and the white of the eye. The uvea is composed of the iris in front, the ciliary body in the middle, and the choroid in the back. The iris is located in the front part of the uvea, a pigmented membrane that determines human eye color. The cause of iritis is often unknown.\nIritis of the ciliary body is divided into 2 types:\nAcute (disease progression in less than 3 months); Chronic (illness lasting more than 3 months)\nThe treatment of iritis in general and iridocyclitis in particular needs to evaluate the inflammation location, duration, and accompanying symptoms. A thorough examination of eye indicators will help the doctor narrow down the cause of iridocyclitis.\n\nCause of iridocyclitis\nIritis generally accounts for 10% (3000) of the 30,000 annual cases of blindness seen in the United States [2]. Often, the cause of iridocyclitis cannot be determined. In some cases, iritis may be related to eye injury, genetic factors, or some other disease. Potential causes of iritis include:\nEye injury: mild trauma, non-penetrating trauma, chemical or temperature burns can also cause acute iritis.; Infection: some parts of the face infected with viruses such as ulcers, shingles caused by herpes virus... can cause iritis.; Other infectious diseases caused by viruses and bacteria may also be associated with uveitis. For example, toxoplasmosis is caused by eating raw or undercooked food, lung infection is caused by inhaling fungal spores, tuberculosis, syphilis...; Genetics: people with some autoimmune diseases have inherited genes that affect the immune system, making them susceptible to acute iritis. Some diseases that affect the gene that causes iritis include: ankylosing spondylitis, arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis.; Behcet's disease: chronic vascular damage, damage to many organs combined with mucositis. Recurrent disease of unknown cause, characterized by mouth and genital ulcers, eye inflammation and skin lesions. Patients with Behcet's disease often present with anterior uveitis or posterior uveitis.; Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: chronic iritis may develop in children with rheumatoid arthritis.; Sarcoidosis (full name Sarcoidosis): is an autoimmune disease that involves the development of inflammatory cells in areas of the body including the eyes. This is a multisystem disease of unknown origin, with characteristic signs of granulomatous inflammation. The disease affects the lungs, 50% of sarcoidosis patients affect the eyes.; Lupus erythematosus: is an autoimmune disease, characterized by the production of substances from antibodies against cell nuclei. Lupus erythematosus is often associated with scleritis, scleritis, lupus retinopathy, and chorioretinopathy. Iritis rarely occurs alone in people with lupus erythematosus, often associated with posterior uveitis.; Medications: some medications such as the antibiotic rifabutin and the antiviral drug cidofovir can be a rare cause of iritis. Stop using these medications if iritis occurs.\nTo effectively treat iritis, it is necessary to understand the immune-inflammatory cascade. There are 2 main causes of inflammatory response [3]:\nInnate immune system; Adaptive immune system.\nThe innate immune system uses macrophages, mast cells and neutrophils to destroy invading bacteria, it can immediately recognize some foreign bacteria, viruses and antigens to fight back without No history of previous antigen exposure is required.\nNormal eyes and eyes with iridocyclitis.\nMeanwhile, the adaptive immune system (including B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes and macrophages) can only respond to previously encountered antigens. Repeated exposure to an antigen leads to increased immune responses, enhancing long-term immune protection against foreign antigens.\n\nSymptoms of iridocyclitis\nIritis can occur in one or both eyes. The disease often develops suddenly and can last up to three months. Symptoms of iritis include:\nRed eyes, inflammation.; Discomfort or pain in the eyes; Sensitive to light.; Reduced vision.; Pupils are small or irregularly shaped on both sides.\nSome factors that can make iritis worse include smoking, immunodeficiency diseases, and genetic changes that affect immune system function.\n\nComplications of iritis\nIritis, if not treated properly, can lead to the following complications:\nCataracts: long-term iritis can cause cataracts. Scratched iritis causes scarring, causing the iris to stick to the lens below the cornea, causing the pupil to have an abnormal shape and react slowly to light.; Glaucoma: recurrent iritis leads to glaucoma and possible loss of vision.; Calcium in the eye: causes corneal degeneration and reduces vision; Retinal detachment: iritis causes fluid to develop in the retina, which can blur or reduce central and macular vision.\nSome cases of iridocyclitis tend to recur. Early treatment can shorten treatment time and reduce complications.\n\nDiagnosis of iritis in general\nThe diagnosis of uveitis is multifaceted, and important diagnostic clues lie in the physical examination and clinical presentation. Several important differences are examined further to fully characterize the condition. The examination process is given as a general principle for diagnosing iridocyclitis.\nThe doctor will evaluate the location of inflammation, time, signs and symptoms, then have the patient make some other diagnoses using eye examination meters. When iritis is suspected, the doctor will prescribe the following diagnoses:\nExternal examination: the doctor uses a LED light to observe the pupil, eye inflammation and other signs if any; Vision: your doctor checks your vision using an eye chart.; Slit lamp examination: use a slit lamp to examine the inside of the eye to look for signs of iritis. The doctor prescribed eye drops to dilate the pupils to help you see clearly inside the eye.\nThe doctor may prescribe additional tests to find the cause.\n\nHow to treat iridocyclitis\nTreatment of iritis aims to preserve vision and reduce pain and inflammation. Normally, iritis will be treated as follows:\nEye drops to reduce inflammation.; Mydriatic eye drops help reduce pain caused by iritis. Mydriatic eye drops also protect you from symptoms that affect the function of your pupils.\nIf the symptoms of the disease do not improve and become more severe, the ophthalmologist will prescribe another oral anti-inflammatory medication. Depending on the patient's condition, the doctor will prescribe an appropriate treatment regimen.\nPatients treated with corticosteroids are usually scheduled for a follow-up visit after 1 week. During the second visit, the number of anterior chamber cells must decrease by half compared to the previous visit. If the number of inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber does not decrease, suspect the patient is not using the drops properly or has iridocyclitis caused by another infectious disease. Therefore, during medical examination and treatment at home, patients need to follow the doctor's instructions exactly.\nMaster Doctor Pham Huy Vu Tung is examining a patient's eyes.\n\nHow to prevent iridocyclitis?\nCiliary iridocyclitis often cannot be prevented because the cause is unknown. However, in people with autoimmune diseases, taking good care of the condition can prevent the occurrence of iritis.\nAlthough iridocyclitis is not dangerous, it causes discomfort and reduced vision. To prevent serious complications, when people see signs of eye abnormalities, they should go to the Ophthalmology Department for early examination and timely treatment.",
