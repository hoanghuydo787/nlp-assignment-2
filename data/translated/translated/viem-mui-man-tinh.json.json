    "content": "Chronic rhinitis: Causes, symptoms, treatment and prevention\n\nChronic rhinitis causes reduced work and learning performance and increases the risk of developing asthma, sinusitis, and otitis media. This article is expertly advised by Nguyen Trung Nguyen, M.D., Doctor of Ear, Nose and Throat Department, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City. Chronic rhinitis is becoming more and more common, causing significant impacts on the patient's health and psychology. Persistent nasal dysfunction can significantly affect physical and emotional functioning, leading to reduced work productivity in adults and impaired learning in children. In addition, chronic rhinitis can worsen or lead to the development of asthma, sinusitis, and otitis media. Therefore, treatment of chronic rhinitis is essential to manage a number of respiratory and ENT diseases as well as improve the quality of life for patients.\nChronic rhinitis is increasingly common, causing significant impacts on patients' psychology, work and study performance.\n\nWhat is chronic rhinitis?\nAccording to MSc. Nguyen Trung Nguyen, Department of Ear, Nose and Throat, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, chronic rhinitis is a condition of rhinitis lasting more than 3 months that can be caused by bacterial, chemical or immune agents. , allergy.\nPostnasal drip is one of the common features of chronic rhinitis. Postnasal drip can lead to a chronic sore throat, chronic cough, or throat clearing.\n\nCauses of chronic rhinitis\nChronic rhinitis is caused by many reasons, including allergies, nasal anatomical defects or certain diseases such as:\nBacterial, fungal, parasitic infections; Allergy; Deviated nasal septum, overdeveloped nasal turbinate; Nasal foreign body; Nasal cavity tumor; Asthma and associated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); Hypertrophic adenoiditis; Gastroesophageal reflux\n\nSymptoms of chronic rhinitis\nSymptoms of chronic rhinitis can vary, depending on the specific cause. But the most common characteristics often include:(2)\nNasal congestion leads to having to breathe through the mouth; Sinusitis, sinus pain; Runny nose, postnasal drip; Chronic cough; Pharyngitis, laryngitis; Allergic rhinitis\n1. Chronic rhinitis due to allergies\nIn allergic rhinitis, symptoms often occur as a result of the body's reaction to an allergen. The most common allergens include seasonal pollen, perennial indoor allergens, such as dust mites, pet dander, and some types of mold. Other allergens may include certain workplace irritants such as chalk dust and coal dust.\nIn addition, in young children, food allergies can also cause symptoms of chronic rhinitis including sneezing, runny nose, stuffy nose, and itchy nose and throat. In this case, nasal mucus is often clear and thin.\n2. Chronic non-allergic rhinitis\nChronic non-allergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis is associated with changes in the nervous system that controls blood vessels in the nose. Overactive nerves in the nose will irritate the nasal mucosa causing symptoms of congestion, runny nose and postnasal drip. Therefore, the patient will be more sensitive to various factors including changes in humidity or exposure to chemicals.(3)\n\nDiagnosis of chronic rhinitis\nThe diagnosis of chronic rhinitis is largely based on clinical symptoms. An ENT doctor may order a sinus X-ray or CT scan to see if the patient has a sinus infection. In addition, the doctor may also prescribe additional skin allergy testing and blood tests to determine whether certain allergens are the cause of allergic rhinitis.(1)\nAccording to MSc. Nguyen Trung Nguyen, if a patient only has symptoms at certain times of the year, it is likely that the patient has allergic rhinitis. Besides, if the allergen is animal fur or indoor dust and the patient has symptoms year-round, it will be determined to have chronic allergic rhinitis.\nPeople with non-allergic rhinitis will not respond to allergy treatments and allergy testing will come back negative. Unlike allergic rhinitis, non-allergic rhinitis does not involve the immune system and rarely causes itching in the nose, eyes or throat like allergies do.\nIn a small number of cases of chronic rhinitis, especially those with intellectual disabilities, vegetative states or long-term comas, and young children who are not well cared for, their noses may contain fly larvae inside the nose. . This disease is common in livestock such as sheep, goats, and cows, but sometimes also occurs in humans. When flies lay eggs around the nostrils, the eggs will hatch into larvae. They move throughout the nasal cavity and sinuses feeding on mucus and debris. At this time, the patient will feel ticklish, have an itchy nose and sneeze a lot. Sneezing is the body's reflex to push foreign objects out of the airway.\nDifferential diagnosis\n1. Foreign body\nThe doctor needs to evaluate for foreign objects in the nose if the patient is a child and has symptoms of chronic nasal congestion on one side frequently, with or without foul-smelling secretions and pus. Foreign objects can be a bean, a grain of rice, a piece of a toy or a small battery lodged deep in the nose and cannot always be detected with the naked eye.\n2. Nasal cavity cancer\nNasal cancer is very rare, accounting for 3% of all head and neck cancers, with an incidence of 1 case per 100,000 people. If an elderly person has symptoms of blockage on one side of the nose and gradual onset of bleeding, nasal cancer should be suspected.\n3. Abnormalities in the anatomy of the nose and pharynx\nCertain anatomic abnormalities of the nose and pharynx can cause chronic symptoms of nasal obstruction without other obvious symptoms.\nAbnormalities include:\nConcha bullosa (airy turbinates): The turbinates are a structure formed from bones inside the nose, helping to control the flow of air into the nose, while also cleaning and warming the air before entering the lungs. If one of the nasal turbinates has air sacs that cause enlargement, it will lead to symptoms of blockage on one or both sides of the nose.; Concha bullosa (airy turbinates): The turbinates are a structure formed from bones inside the nose, helping to control the flow of air into the nose, while also cleaning and warming the air before entering the lungs. If one of the nasal turbinates has air sacs that cause enlargement, it will lead to symptoms of blockage on one or both sides of the nose.\nDeviated nasal septum: Deviated nasal septum narrows the airways and can cause nasal symptoms such as stuffy nose, sore nose, runny nose.; Deviated nasal septum: Deviated nasal septum narrows the airways and can cause nasal symptoms such as stuffy nose, sore nose, and runny nose.\nAdenoid tissue hypertrophy: A condition in which adenoid tissue in the nasal dome grows beyond normal, causing symptoms of rhinosinusitis such as stuffy nose, runny nose.; Adenoid tissue hypertrophy: A condition in which the adenoid tissue in the nasal dome grows beyond normal, causing symptoms of rhinosinusitis such as stuffy nose and runny nose.\nDeviated nasal septum also causes chronic rhinitis\n\nHow to treat chronic rhinitis\nAccording to Dr. Trung Nguyen, depending on the severity of chronic rhinitis, the doctor may prescribe treatment methods. For mild conditions, patients can be treated with medication as prescribed by their doctor, combined with home remedies. For severe conditions, nose surgery may be indicated.\n1. Treat chronic rhinitis with medication\nAntihistamines: Often prescribed to treat allergic rhinitis. Antihistamines can be taken as sprays or pills. However, patients should not use it for a long time because it can cause some side effects that are not beneficial for rhinitis recovery.; Antihistamines: Often prescribed to treat allergic rhinitis.

In addition, chronic rhinitis may also improve with treatment with ipratropium spray or steroid medications.\n2. Treat chronic rhinitis at home\nSome measures to help improve symptoms of chronic rhinitis at home that patients can apply include:\nRinsing the nose with physiological saline is a common treatment support method for rhinosinusitis. Patients only need to spray or irrigate saline into both nostrils to clean bacteria and nasal secretions daily, helping to improve the symptoms of the disease.; Rinsing the nose with physiological saline is a common treatment support method for rhinosinusitis. Patients only need to spray or irrigate saline into both nostrils to clean bacteria and nasal secretions daily, helping to improve symptoms of the disease.\nAvoid contact with allergens: For chronic rhinitis caused by allergies, patients need to avoid allergens such as chemicals, dust mites, pollen, animal dander...; Avoid contact with allergens: For chronic rhinitis caused by allergies, patients need to avoid allergens such as chemicals, dust mites, pollen, animal hair, etc.\n3. ClariFix cryotherapy treatment\nIf the above treatments do not respond to chronic rhinitis, the patient may be prescribed ClariFix treatment.\nClariFix is ​​a medical device cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of chronic rhinitis in adults. ClariFix Cryotherapy uses breakthrough cooling technology, targeting inflamed nasal tissue and the underlying nerves. The purpose of this is to cool infected tissue to freezing temperatures to reduce nerve signals and improve nasal symptoms, including runny nose and congestion.\n\nComplications of chronic rhinitis\nChronic rhinitis can cause serious complications that affect the patient's long-term health.\nDirect or indirect complications may include:\nAcute or chronic sinusitis; Purulent otitis media or serous otitis media; Sleep disorders or sleep apnea syndrome; Dental problems; Eustachian tube dysfunction; Nasal polyps; Hearing loss; Abnormal craniofacial development; Makes asthma worse or increases the tendency to develop asthma\n\nHow to prevent chronic rhinitis\nMSc. Dr. Nguyen Trung Nguyen advises that to prevent chronic rhinitis, patients need to manage the causes of the disease well, such as:\nChronic rhinitis due to allergies: Patients need to avoid contact with allergens such as dust, pollen, animal hair, chemicals.; Chronic allergic rhinitis: Patients need to avoid contact with allergens such as dust, pollen, animal hair, and chemicals.\nChronic rhinitis due to foreign objects: Parents need to keep an eye on their children regularly and should not let them play with nuts or toys that are too small. If there are strange signs, take your child to see an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist; Chronic rhinitis due to foreign objects: Parents need to keep an eye on their children regularly and should not let them play with nuts or toys that are too small. If there are strange signs, take your child to see an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist.\nChronic rhinitis due to parasitic infection: Need to clean the living area and personal hygiene every day. People with little or no ability to care for themselves such as vegetative people, newborns, people with intellectual disabilities, people with serious accidents... need to be monitored and well cared for to prevent the risk of infection. parasites.; Chronic rhinitis due to parasitic infection: Need to clean the living area and personal hygiene every day. People with little or no ability to care for themselves such as vegetative people, newborns, people with intellectual disabilities, people with serious accidents... need to be monitored and well cared for to prevent the risk of infection. parasites.\nIn addition, we should avoid catching the flu, recurring rhinitis or ear, nose and throat infections... which can lead to chronic rhinitis by cleaning the nose and throat every day; Wear a mask when leaving the house; Avoid going to crowded places to prevent infectious diseases that can lead to chronic rhinitis. In addition, when there are unusual ear, nose, and throat symptoms that last more than a week and do not go away, we should go to an ear, nose, and throat doctor to find the cause early and get timely treatment.\nWhen ENT symptoms last more than a week and do not go away, the patient should see a doctor to find the cause and receive timely treatment.\n\nFrequently asked questions about chronic rhinitis\n1. Can chronic rhinitis be cured?\nChronic rhinitis can be cured and the sooner it is treated, the fewer complications, the higher the effectiveness, the less expensive and quicker the recovery.\n2. Is chronic rhinitis dangerous?\nChronic rhinitis is not an emergency medical condition, however, if left untreated for too long, it can lead to many complications that affect health, psychology, and in the worst case, it can be life-threatening. patient's life.\nComplications of otitis media: Can lead to hearing loss, temporary deafness or permanent deafness due to perforated eardrum.; Complications of sinusitis: Sinus infection can spread to the tear ducts, causing eyelid swelling and impaired vision. Intracranial invasive infection can cause meningoencephalitis leading to death.\n3. Is chronic rhinitis more dangerous than acute rhinitis?\nChronic and acute rhinitis both cause similar nasal symptoms but differ in the duration of the disease. Specifically, chronic rhinitis lasts more than 3 months. Chronic and acute rhinitis can cause equally dangerous complications, especially complications in the brain.\nDepartment of Ear, Nose and Throat, Tam Anh General Hospital examines, diagnoses, and intensively treats ear, nose, and throat diseases, including chronic rhinitis. With a team of skilled and experienced experts and leading doctors, supported by the most modern medical examination and treatment equipment system and many machines currently only available at Tam Anh General Hospital such as measuring machines. audiology, NATUS vestibule from the US, Xion endoscope from Germany, INTERACOUSTIC audiology function tester from Denmark... along with close cooperation in diagnosis and treatment between ENT and Cardiology specialties , Oncology, Imaging Diagnosis, Nutrition... help provide professional, comprehensive, and highly effective medical examination and treatment.\n“Although chronic rhinitis is not an emergency medical condition, it should be treated early to avoid complications that affect vision, hearing or threaten the patient's life, especially children. The prevention of chronic rhinitis should also receive more attention, especially in people with allergies, sinusitis, asthma, and deviated nasal septum,\" Dr. Nguyen recommended.",
