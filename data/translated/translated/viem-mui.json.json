    "content": "Rhinitis: Signs, classification, treatment and prevention\n\nAlthough rhinitis is not life-threatening, it causes many inconveniences for the patient. In the following article, Specialist Doctor I Tran Phuong Thanh, Department of Ear, Nose and Throat, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, gives patients the most general information about symptoms, types of rhinitis as well as advice on how to treat rhinitis. treat and prevent disease.\nRhinitis can affect people for a short time or on a chronic basis\n\nWhat is rhinitis?\nRhinitis is an inflammation of the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity, leading to symptoms of stuffy nose, runny nose, itching and sneezing. Rhinitis can affect the patient in the short term (acute) or long term (chronic). Acute rhinitis is usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection or allergies, but can also be caused by other causes. Chronic rhinitis often accompanies chronic sinus and pharyngitis diseases.(1)\n\nSymptoms of rhinitis\nSigns of rhinitis can range from mild to severe. They often affect the patient's nasal cavity, throat and eyes, including:\nNasal congestion Runny nose Itchy nose, throat, eyes and ears Postnasal drip Sneezing Cough Sore throat Watery eyes Snoring Headache Facial pain Decreased sense of smell, taste or hearing.; Stuffy nose; Have a runny nose; Itchy nose, throat, eyes and ears; Postnasal drip; Sneezing; Cough; Sore throat; Weep; Sleep; Headache; Facial pain; Reduced sense of smell, taste or hearing.\n\nCommon forms of rhinitis\nRhinitis is divided into two main types: allergic rhinitis and non-allergic rhinitis.\n1. Allergic rhinitis\nAllergic rhinitis is the most common form of rhinitis\nAllergic rhinitis occurs when the body's immune system detects and responds to agents (called allergens) from the environment. These agents are harmless to most people (such as dust, mold, pollen, animal dander, perfume, etc.), but if the patient is allergic to them, the body will react as if they were harmful.\nWhen exposed to allergens, the patient's immune system will produce antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE). This releases chemicals involved in the inflammatory response, including histamine, leading to the uncomfortable symptoms of allergic rhinitis.\n2. Non-allergic rhinitis\nUnlike allergic rhinitis, non-allergic rhinitis is not triggered by allergens and does not involve an immune system response. It is divided into many smaller types depending on the cause of the disease, the most common are:\n3. Viral rhinitis\nThis type of rhinitis occurs due to invasion and attack from viruses, such as cold viruses or flu viruses. Inflammation stimulates mucus production, causing sneezing, runny nose and many other symptoms.\n4. Vasomotor rhinitis\nVasomotor rhinitis is a condition in which the blood vessels in the nose become overly sensitive due to an imbalance in the nervous system that controls the nasal mucosa. When blood vessels are too sensitive, certain environmental factors can cause them to dilate, leading to increased mucus secretion and congestion.\nIrritants can include chemical irritants, perfumes, cigarette smoke, changes in temperature, humidity, drinking too much alcohol, spicy foods, stress, etc.\n5. Atrophic rhinitis\nAtrophic rhinitis is a chronic disease that occurs when the nasal mucosa atrophies and hardens, causing the nasal cavity to expand, become dry and crusty. The proliferation of microorganisms also causes unpleasant odors, but often the patient does not smell it because the sense of smell is also reduced or lost due to mucosal atrophy.\n6. Drug-induced rhinitis\nDrug-induced rhinitis often occurs when there is overuse of over-the-counter decongestants (nasal sprays or drops). At this time, instead of reducing nasal and sinus symptoms, the decongestant will irritate the nasal mucosa and lead to rhinitis.\n\nRisk factors for rhinitis\nPeople with a history of asthma are more susceptible to allergic rhinitis than people without the disease\nPeople with a history of asthma or other types of allergies, or a blood relative (parents, siblings) with allergies or asthma, are at high risk of developing allergic rhinitis. In addition, people who live or work in environments that are frequently exposed to allergens, such as dust mites or animal hair, are also susceptible to the onset of the disease.\nFor non-allergic rhinitis, factors that may increase your risk include:\nAge: Non-allergic rhinitis usually occurs after age 20 Gender: Women are more likely to have rhinitis and nasal congestion that gets worse during menstruation and pregnancy due to hormonal changes. Exposure to irritants: Frequent exposure to irritants such as dust, exhaust fumes or cigarette smoke can increase the risk of disease. Occupation: In some cases, non-allergic rhinitis is triggered when the person is exposed to airborne irritants at work. Some common agents include construction materials, solvents, chemicals, fumes from organic materials, etc. Pathology: Some chronic health conditions can cause or worsen rhinitis. due to allergies, such as hypothyroidism, chronic fatigue syndrome and diabetes.; Age: Non-allergic rhinitis often occurs after age 20; Gender: Women are more susceptible to rhinitis and nasal congestion during menstruation and pregnancy due to hormonal changes.; Exposure to irritants: Frequent exposure to irritants such as dust, exhaust fumes or cigarette smoke can increase the risk of disease.; Occupation: In some cases, non-allergic rhinitis is triggered when the person is exposed to airborne irritants at work. Some common agents include construction materials, solvents, chemicals, fumes from organic materials...; Medical conditions: Certain chronic health conditions can cause or worsen non-allergic rhinitis, such as hypothyroidism, chronic fatigue syndrome and diabetes.\n\nDiagnosis of rhinitis\nTo diagnose rhinitis, the doctor will first check the patient's medical history and ask about the symptoms the patient is experiencing. Because the symptoms of some types of rhinitis are relatively similar, to determine whether the disease is related to allergies or not, the doctor may ask the patient to conduct an allergy test with a blood test or skin test. .\nA CT scan can also be used to confirm the diagnosis and examine changes in the nasal cavity. A CT scan or nasal endoscopy can also rule out sinusitis.\nIn the case of drug-induced rhinitis, the doctor will ask the patient about the use of decongestants as well as other medications.\n\nTreatment of rhinitis\nTreatment for rhinitis depends on the specific cause or diagnosis.\nFor allergic rhinitis, the best way to prevent symptoms is to avoid exposure to allergens as much as possible. If the person is allergic to pet dander, mold or other allergens in the home, find ways to remove those substances from the living area. If you are allergic to pollen, limit time outdoors during seasons with high pollen counts and on windy days. Sick people should also close windows, doors, and car doors to prevent pollen from flying into the house or car.\nHowever, avoiding allergens is sometimes quite difficult. At this time, medication can help reduce symptoms. Your doctor may give you over-the-counter or prescription corticosteroid nasal sprays, antihistamines, decongestants, or other medications. In addition, immunotherapy is also a method that can be considered to reduce the patient's sensitivity to allergens.\nYour doctor may prescribe certain medications to help reduce rhinitis symptoms.\nIf you have non-allergic rhinitis, your doctor may recommend over-the-counter or prescription medications such as corticosteroid nasal sprays, saline drops, antihistamine nasal sprays, or decongestants for treatment.\nIf the cause of your symptoms is an abnormality in the structure of your nasal cavity, your doctor may recommend surgery to correct it.\n\nNutrition for people with rhinitis\nBesides following the doctor's treatment instructions, patients also need to have a scientific diet so that symptoms can soon improve.\n1. What should you eat if you have rhinitis?\nPeople with rhinitis, especially allergic rhinitis, should increase the following foods:\nFoods rich in vitamin C: Vitamin C has the effect of increasing resistance and the immune system, very good for people with allergic rhinitis. Patients can easily supplement this micronutrient through cauliflower, broccoli, bell peppers or citrus fruits such as oranges, grapefruit... Foods rich in omega-3: Some studies show that omega-3 fatty acids ( found in many types of fish: tuna, salmon, mackerel...) can reduce the risk of developing allergies. They also help prevent inflammatory reactions in the respiratory tract. Warm liquids: Warm liquids, broths, and soups help clear congestion in the airways, thin mucus, and aid circulation. Honey, onions, garlic, ginger, mint, coriander... are all beneficial foods for people with rhinitis. Therefore, patients can properly supplement them in their daily diet.; Foods rich in vitamin C: Vitamin C has the effect of increasing resistance and the immune system, very good for people with allergic rhinitis.

What should you avoid eating with rhinitis?\nPeople with rhinitis should be careful when eating allergenic foods such as shrimp, crab, squid, eggs, milk, peanuts... or strange foods such as silkworm pupae. Hot and spicy foods such as chili, pepper, and mustard can also cause patients to cough, runny nose, and sneeze...\nMilk and dairy products can increase mucus secretion, causing airway obstruction. In addition, patients should not drink beer, wine, coffee... because they can dehydrate and make rhinitis more serious.\n\nHow to prevent rhinitis\nThere is no way to prevent allergic rhinitis, as it is an immune system response. However, to avoid symptoms affecting life, patients need to find ways to minimize exposure to allergens and take medication as directed by their doctor.\nIf rhinitis is not related to allergies, here is what you can do to reduce symptoms and prevent recurrence:\nAvoid agents that cause disease or make symptoms worse; Do not abuse decongestants; Contact your doctor again if treatment is not effective. Your doctor can make changes to make your rhinitis treatment more effective.\nDepartment of Ear, Nose and Throat, Tam Anh General Hospital is a leading prestigious address in the examination and treatment of Ear, Nose and Throat diseases.
