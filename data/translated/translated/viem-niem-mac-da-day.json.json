    "content": "Gastric mucosal inflammation: Causes, symptoms and treatments\n\nGastric mucosal inflammation is a common obsession of many people when it appears with many unpleasant symptoms, affecting health, psychology as well as daily activities. The condition can be effectively improved if detected and treated promptly. However, in the opposite case, inflammation can lead to many dangerous complications.\n\nWhat is gastric mucosal inflammation?\nGastritis is an inflammation, irritation, and erosion of the stomach lining (stomach) that occurs because the protective layer (mucosa) is damaged and weakened. The main cause is bacterial infection, painkiller abuse or some other related factors. The disease can occur suddenly or appear gradually over time. Most of the time, this condition can improve quickly with appropriate treatment. However, in some cases, inflammation can also develop into ulcers and increase the risk of stomach cancer.\n1. Acute gastric mucosal inflammation\nThis is a condition in which the stomach lining suddenly becomes inflamed or swollen, causing severe pain and discomfort. The disease can appear due to injury, stress, consumption of stimulants, NSAIDs, steroids, spicy foods, or under the influence of bacteria or viruses. However, most pain only appears temporarily and lasts for short periods at a certain time.(1)\n2. Chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa\nThis is a persistent but low-level inflammation and damage to the stomach lining. At this time, the stomach lining gradually becomes thinner because cells are destroyed by the immune response mechanism, including Lymphocytes. When the chronic condition lasts continuously for many years, inflammation will progress to the stage of mucosal atrophy, metaplasia and dysplasia with an increased risk of stomach cancer.\n\nCauses of inflammation of the gastric mucosa\nGastric mucosal inflammation occurs because the protective barrier of the stomach wall is weakened or damaged by digestive juices. Specifically, some main causes include: (2)\n1. Bacterial infection\nHelicobacter pylori (H.p) infection is one of the most common infections in the world, affecting about 50-70% of the population. However, only a small number of cases develop gastritis or other digestive disorders. Diseases stemming from this group of causes can be genetic or influenced by living and eating habits.\n2. Regularly use pain relievers\nPain relievers or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) can cause acute and chronic gastritis. Caused by excessive or frequent use will reduce the protective ability of the mucosal layer.\n3. Age\nOlder people often face a higher risk of gastric mucosal inflammation than younger people. The reason is that at this stage, the possibility of being attacked by Helicobacter Pylori and autoimmune disorders also increases. From there, the erosion process also becomes faster.\n4. Alcohol abuse\nAlcohol can irritate and corrode the stomach lining, making the organ vulnerable to digestive juices. Therefore, abuse of this type of stimulant is one of the common causes of acute gastritis.\n5. Stress\nPsychological instability can also cause inflammation of the stomach lining. In particular, severe stress after injury, infection, surgery... can easily cause the disease to progress quickly and become complicated.\n6. Cancer treatment\nMany cancer patients have to regularly face gastritis. The cause mostly comes from the chemotherapy or radiotherapy drugs being used.\n7. Autoimmune gastritis\nThis is a condition in which the body attacks the cells in the stomach lining. This reaction accidentally causes the stomach's protective barrier to be eroded. This condition often appears commonly in people suffering from other autoimmune disorders such as Hashimoto's, type 1 diabetes... In addition, Vitamin B12 deficiency in the body can also be the cause of gastritis. autoimmune.\n\nSymptoms of stomach mucositis\nMany cases have inflammation of the stomach lining but do not come with any unusual symptoms. However, in general, some common signs of the disease include:\nBlack stools, with tar.; Nausea.; Abdominal pain recurs many times; Distention.; Undigested.; A burning, gnawing feeling in the stomach appears between meals or at night.; Hiccup.; Loss of appetite; Vomiting blood or coffee-colored substance.\n\nDangerous complications of gastric mucosal inflammation\nGastric mucosal inflammation can be improved quickly if detected and treated promptly. In the opposite case, the patient is at risk of facing many dangerous complications. Specifically includes:\n1. Peptic ulcer disease\nLong-term inflammation of the stomach lining can cause ulcers to appear, causing pain in the epigastric area. This is also the cause of the body's reduced ability to absorb Vitamin B12, leading to anemia.\n2. Stomach bleeding\nStomach ulcers have the risk of puncturing blood vessels, leading to dangerous bleeding. In the long term, the body will face severe anemia due to its inability to produce healthy red blood cells.\n3. Gastric perforation\nWhen the mucosa is damaged, the ulcers will become severe and spread deeply through the stomach wall, causing gastric perforation. This can cause fluid to overflow into the abdomen and spread bacteria, causing peritonitis. In addition, sepsis also has a high risk of appearing and spreading, even leading to death.\n4. Pyloric stenosis\nThis is a condition in which fibrotic tissue develops, causing a narrowing of the intestinal lumen just below the stomach. From there, the movement of food through the digestive tract is hindered.\n5. Stomach cancer\nIf not treated promptly, mucositis can cause stomach cancer cells to grow out of control. This is considered the most dangerous complication, posing a direct threat to the patient's life.\n\nHow to treat gastric mucosal inflammation\nTreatment for gastric mucosal inflammation will vary depending on the cause of the disease and the extent of damage. However, in general, common methods commonly applied include:\n1. Using medicine\nThis is the first and most common treatment solution for inflammation of the stomach lining. Some commonly preferred medications include:\nAntibiotics kill Helicobacter Pylori bacteria\nFor Helicobacter Pylori growing in the digestive tract, the doctor may recommend a combination of antibiotics such as: Tetracycline, Tinidazole, Metronidazole, Levofloxacin... Patients need to make sure to take the full course of medication as prescribed, usually for 10-14 days, along with acid blockers and Bismuth. After treatment, your doctor will test again to make sure Helicobacter Pylori has been destroyed.\nThe drug stops stomach acid production and promotes healing\nProton pump inhibitors have the ability to reduce acidity by blocking the activity of the cells that produce this component. Specifically, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs: Esomeprazole, Omeprazole, Lansoprazole, Rabeprazole, Pantoprazole...\nHowever, using Proton pump inhibitors for long periods of time and at high doses may increase the risk of bone and joint disease and intestinal dysbiosis or some other side effects. Therefore, patients need to consult a doctor to ensure the best solution.\nThe medicine reduces stomach acid production\nAcid blockers or Histamine (H-2) blockers will reduce the amount of acid secreted in the digestive tract to effectively reduce pain caused by inflammation. Commonly used types available by prescription or over-the-counter include: Famotidine, Cimetidine, Nizatidine...\nDrugs that neutralize stomach acid\nThis is a medicine that helps neutralize stomach acid to relieve pain quickly. However, common side effects can be constipation or diarrhea, depending on the main ingredient.\nHowever, even when using any type of anti-inflammatory medication, patients need to carefully consult a specialist. This will help the treatment process achieve positive results as well as minimize unwanted side effects that affect health.\n2. Treatment without using drugs\nIf gastric mucosal inflammation occurs due to pernicious anemia, your doctor may prescribe Vitamin B12 injections to improve the condition. In addition, absolutely avoiding spicy foods, foods containing Gluten from wheat, Lactose from milk... will also bring high efficiency to the treatment process.\n\nHow to prevent stomach lining from becoming inflamed?\nInflammation of the stomach lining can lead to many serious health complications if not treated promptly. Therefore, proactive prevention from the beginning is really important and necessary. Some useful solutions include:\nPrevent the risk of Helicobacter Pylori infection by maintaining daily hygiene habits.; Take good care of your mental health by reducing stress, keeping your mind comfortable and happy.; Divide your daily meals into small portions, eat regularly and more slowly.; Minimize eating foods high in sugar, salt, oil, etc.; Absolutely stop smoking (if you smoke).; Minimize alcohol and caffeine consumption.\n\nNutrition for people with gastric mucosal inflammation\nDaily diet directly affects the process of recovering damage to the stomach lining. Therefore, patients need to pay attention to choosing appropriate foods.\n1. What should you eat if you have inflammation of the stomach lining?\nPatients should prioritize certain foods to help control stomach mucosa inflammation and uncomfortable symptoms. Specifically includes:\nFoods rich in fiber: Whole grains, green vegetables, beans, fruits, vegetables...; Low-fat foods: Fish, green vegetables, lean meat...; Foods containing low acid concentrations: Vegetables, beans...; The drink does not contain gas or caffeine.; Foods containing Probiotics: Yogurt, kimchi, probiotics...\n2. What should you avoid if you have inflammation of the stomach lining?\nAn unhealthy diet will make inflammation of the stomach lining more serious. Specifically, patients should avoid or minimize the consumption of the following harmful foods:\nAcidic foods: Tomatoes, some fruits...; Wine.; Carbonated beverage.; Coffee.; Fatty foods.; Fried foods.; Various types of fruit juices.; Pickled and pickled foods; Spicy and hot food; Tea.\nIn addition, if the patient notices that any certain food or food group makes inflammation symptoms worse, stop using it immediately. This may bring many positive improvements to the medical condition.\nCenter for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City) and Department of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreatic (Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing High-class, effective examination and treatment services for patients with mild to severe liver problems (fatty liver, acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer...).
