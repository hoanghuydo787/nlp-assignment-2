    "content": "Urethritis: Causes, symptoms and treatment\n\nUrethritis can occur in both men and women. In particular, the incidence of the disease is often high in men of reproductive age. The main cause may be related to agents that cause sexually transmitted infections. If not detected and treated promptly, the disease can cause dangerous complications, seriously affecting the patient's health and spirit.\n\nWhat is urethritis?\nUrethritis is an acute or chronic inflammation of the urethra. Urethral discharge and pain during urination are typical signs of this disease. Urethritis is often caused by bacteria and can be cured with antibiotics (1). The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body. In addition, the urethra is also the exit route for semen during ejaculation.\n\nClassification of urethritis\nBacterial urethritis includes two main groups: gonococcal urethritis and non-gonococcal urethritis, specifically:\nGonococcal urethritis: the causative agent is gonococcal, spherical, gram-negative bacteria (Neisseria gonorrhoeae). Gonococcal urethritis accounts for about 20% of all urethritis cases.; Urethritis caused by agents other than gonorrhea bacteria: Chlamydia is the most common agent in this group.\nHowever, urethritis may also be unrelated to sexually transmitted agents. Common cases include urethral trauma; Procedures performed through the urinary tract such as catheterization, cystoscopy..., stones or foreign objects in the urethra.\n\nCauses of urethritis\nMost causes of urethritis are caused by bacteria. Bacteria enter the urethra from the outside, the skin around the opening of the vagina or penis. Causes of urethritis include:\nSexually transmitted bacteria: Gonorrhea bacteria (Neisseria gonorrhoeae), Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis...; Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1, HSV-2) is also capable of causing urethral ulcers; Intestinal gram-negative bacteria such as: E Coli, Klebsiella, Proteus...\nSexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia are usually limited to the urethra. However, the infection can spread to the reproductive organs. In women, causes pelvic inflammatory disease. For men, it can cause prostatitis, orchitis and epididymitis, potentially leading to infertility.\nSexually transmitted infections can cause prostatitis\nUrethritis often appears after unsafe sex due to infection with sexually transmitted bacteria (STIs) such as gonorrhea, chlamydia or herpes simplex virus. These cases are often found in young, sexually active men.\n\nSymptoms of urethritis\nEarly recognition of urethritis symptoms will help prevent and treat the disease effectively. Some symptoms of urethritis:\nUrinating many times a day, the amount of urine is usually not much, there is a burning sensation along the urethra, the urine is mixed with pus or fresh blood.; The urinary tract is red, swollen, itchy, and has white, green, or yellow-green mucus secretions. This condition appears more often in the early morning.; Feeling pain in the genitals: Pain during intercourse, pain in the lower abdomen; Some other symptoms: Fever, nausea, groin lymph nodes, swollen joints...\nWhen noticing these symptoms, patients should see a doctor as soon as possible. (2)\n\nComplications of urethritis\nBacterial urethritis can usually be treated with medication. However, when the disease is not treated promptly and properly, the patient can face serious complications such as urethral stricture, infection spreading to other areas of the urinary tract such as the bladder and kidneys. . Some genital tract complications such as epididymal orchitis... can lead to infertility.\n\nDiagnosis of urethritis\nDiagnosis of urethritis is mainly based on symptoms and urethral fluid testing (3), specifically:\nMain symptoms: Painful urination and urethral discharge; Clinical examination: Check the prostate, testicles, epididymis, spermatic cord, and inguinal nodes. Look for inflammatory lesions and ulcers on the skin to check for other sexually transmitted diseases such as HPV, herpes simplex, syphilis...; Check the prostate, testicles, epididymis, spermatic cord, inguinal lymph nodes; Look for inflammatory lesions and ulcers on the skin to check for other sexually transmitted diseases such as HPV, herpes simplex, syphilis...; Urethral fluid testing: Fresh examination, gram staining or PCR of urethral fluid to look for pathogenic bacteria. In addition, patients also need to check for other agents that cause sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis, hepatitis B, C and HIV.\n\nTreatment of urethritis\nAcute bacterial urethritis will quickly heal with appropriate antibiotic treatment. In addition, risk factors for the disease must also be detected and treated to avoid disease recurrence. If you have phimosis or long foreskin, circumcision can help prevent the infection from spreading.\n\nPrevention of urethritis\nMany bacteria that cause urethritis can be transmitted from one person to another through sexual contact. Therefore, practicing safe sex measures is also the secret to effective disease prevention, specifically:\nAvoid having relationships with many people.; Regularly use condoms every time you have sex.; Protect others: If you discover that you have a sexually transmitted disease, you should notify your partner immediately.\nIn addition, to prevent urethritis, you also need to build a healthy and scientific lifestyle to ensure the safety of your health and that of the community such as:\nEat enough nutrients to supplement energy, increase the body's resistance and immunity.; Add enough water: Every day, you should add about 2 - 2.5 liters of water, to help the body eliminate toxins better; Avoid holding urine too much and for too long: This bad habit will cause bacteria to accumulate inside. This is the common cause of urethritis.; Wear clothes that are loose, comfortable, airy and have good sweat absorption. You need to avoid tightness and humidity in the private area, creating opportunities for bacteria to grow and develop, causing infection; It is necessary to have a plan for regular health examinations to detect early signs of urethritis and other dangerous diseases, thereby taking timely intervention measures to prevent dangerous complications.\nThe Center for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts in internal medicine and surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
