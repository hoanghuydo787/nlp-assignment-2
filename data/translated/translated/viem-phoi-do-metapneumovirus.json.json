    "content": "Metapneumovirus pneumonia: Causes, signs and treatment\n\nMetapneumovirus is a strain of virus that causes respiratory infections in young children. Among them, pneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus is a dangerous disease that needs to be detected and treated early to prevent dangerous complications.\n\nWhat is Metapneumovirus pneumonia?\nPneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus is an inflammatory condition of the lung parenchyma, including alveolitis, alveolar sacs, alveolar ducts, interstitial connective tissue and terminal bronchiolitis due to invasion and rapid spread. of Metapneumovirus.\nChildren under 5 years old, adults over 65 years old and people with weak immune systems are susceptible to Metapneumovirus pneumonia. When a child is infected, he or she can easily spread the disease to others in the family, school, playground, etc., thereby causing an outbreak in the community. Furthermore, when infected, the condition has a higher risk of complications. (first)\n\nSigns of pneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus\nFever, cough, runny nose, and difficulty breathing are common symptoms of pneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus\nSymptoms of pneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus will usually appear after about 3-5 days after being infected with the virus. Initial symptoms are often mild and easily confused with the common flu, such as:\nCough;; Runny nose;; Fever.\nThen, the illness starts to get worse after a few days with symptoms such as:\nHigh fever;; Difficulty breathing, wheezing;; Severe cough, with thick phlegm;; Skin and lips turn purple;; Respiratory failure.\nFever, cough, runny nose, and difficulty breathing are common symptoms of pneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus\n\nThe cause of pneumonia is Metapneumovirus\nThe cause of this pneumonia is the invasion of MetapneumovirusÂ  (Human Metapneumovirus- hMPV).\nMetapneumovirus is a new virus belonging to the Paramyxovirus family discovered in 2001 by scientists in the Netherlands, with many similar epidemiological characteristics to RSV, the respiratory syncytial virus that often causes illness in winter and spring in Vietnam. .\nMetapneumovirus is transmitted from person to person mainly by direct contact with droplets containing the disease-causing virus in the air released by the patient from the body when communicating, coughing, sneezing, etc. In rare cases, patients become infected by contact with surfaces containing disease-causing viruses such as door handles, toys, personal items, etc.\nThis strain of virus can cause acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in all ages. When infected with the virus, the patient develops upper respiratory symptoms such as frequent coughing, difficulty breathing, and fever. The disease then progresses with signs of coughing a lot, feeling short of breath, wheezing, and in some more severe cases there are signs of lung damage on X-ray, pneumonia or bronchiolitis.\nAccording to medical experts, Metapneumovirus is less common and usually does not cause severe symptoms. However, in the North of our country, during the transition period of winter and early spring, the weather changes erratically, with high humidity in the air creating conditions for viruses and bacteria that cause respiratory diseases such as RSV, pneumococcus, and influenza. , Hib, Metapneumovirus... thrive, thereby increasing the number of cases. (2)\nWhen co-infected with Metapneumovirus with other bacteria and viruses, the risk of the disease progressing seriously and causing complications increases. In addition, the increase in the number of severe cases due to Metapneumovirus is caused by \"immune debt\" after social distancing and reduced contact during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHow to diagnose pneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus\nTo diagnose pneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus, in addition to a clinical examination and asking about medical history, the doctor may request additional medical procedures to diagnose the cause of the disease and its severity. of the disease, from there, choose the appropriate treatment method.\nChest X-ray;; Sputum culture;; Blood tests;; Bronchoscopy;; CT scan;; PCR test;; Panel 2 test.\n\nTreatment of pneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus\nChildren with severe pneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus receive special treatment and care at V\nCurrently, there are not many specific studies on specific treatment drugs or complications after Metapneumovirus infection. Available treatments are aimed at treating symptoms, infections and preventing complications, including:\nUse fever-reducing medication (paracetamol or ibuprofen) in appropriate doses when the patient has a high fever;; Drink plenty of water, especially fruit juices or Oresol rehydration and electrolyte solutions to balance electrolytes and supplement the amount of water lost due to fever and vomiting;; Perform the nebulization method when the patient has spasms;; Respiratory support using oxygen and ventilator methods when the patient has respiratory failure;; Adjust nutritional regimen to supplement energy and improve patient's resistance;; Use medications to treat coughs, runny nose, etc. as prescribed by your doctor.\nNormally, cases of pneumonia are mild and will go away on their own after about 7 days if properly cared for and treated. However, in some cases the patient needs to be taken to the hospital for support if the disease does not show signs of improvement after about 7-10 days or unusual signs appear such as:\nContinuous high fever;; Fever above 39 degrees and no signs of hypothermia after using fever-reducing medicine;; Shortness of breath;; Lots of wheezing;; Eat poorly, stop eating, stop breastfeeding;; Purple lips, purple extremities;\nIn addition, when a child has pneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus, mothers can monitor it at home by counting their breathing rate when the child lies still, sleeps peacefully, and does not cry. If the child's breathing rate exceeds the following indicators, parents should take the child to the hospital as soon as possible:\nChildren under 2 months old, breathing rate over 60 times/minute; Children from 2 months - 1 year old, breathing rate less than 50 times/minute.\nChildren with severe pneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus receive special treatment and care at the hospital.\n\nPrevention of pneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus\nCurrently, there is no vaccine to prevent Metapneumovirus, however we can reduce the risk of getting the disease by performing the following preventive measures:\nFollow a scientific, nutritious diet and drink enough water every day;; Wear a mask when going to public places;; Avoid going to crowded places when the disease breaks out;; Avoid contact with people showing signs of respiratory diseases;; Develop the habit of regularly washing your hands with soap or alcohol-based hand sanitizer;; Regularly rinse your mouth with salt water or antiseptic solution;; Keep the house neat and clean;; Regularly disinfect the living environment;; Do not smoke and limit exposure to environments with lots of dust and cigarette smoke;; Limit sharing personal items with others;; Be fully vaccinated as recommended by the Ministry of Health;; Strengthen the immune system by getting enough sleep, staying mentally relaxed, and regularly exercising and playing sports;; Perform preventive treatment when there are signs of pneumonia and go to the hospital as soon as the illness becomes severe or pneumonia is suspected.\n\nComplications of pneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus\nPneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus, if not treated properly, can prolong the disease leading to bacterial co-infection, causing many dangerous complications such as:\nSepsis: occurs when bacteria enter the bloodstream from the lungs, spreading to other organs. This condition can cause organ failure if not detected and treated early.; Respiratory failure: often occurs when the patient has severe pneumonia. The patient needs mechanical ventilation support until the lungs heal.; Pleural effusion: occurs when fluid accumulates inside the space between the tissue lining the lungs and the chest cavity, causing difficulty breathing. When experiencing this complication, the patient may need emergency aspiration or drainage.; Lung abscess: occurs when pus forms in a cavity of the lung. Depending on the severity of complications, patients with lung abscesses may be treated with antibiotics, surgery, or drainage with a needle or long tube.\nFor more information about care and health issues, you can contact the Department of Pediatrics, Tam Anh General Hospital at:\nMost cases of pneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus are mild. However, we should not be subjective because the disease can get worse and leave many serious health consequences if not treated properly.",
