    "content": "Pneumonia: Causes, signs, diagnosis and treatment\n\nAccording to Dr. Nguyen Thi Mong Trinh, respiratory specialist, Department of Examination, Tam Anh General Hospital, pneumonia is a dangerous disease, in which pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus discovered since 2019 has been affecting strong impact on the global economy and life. The number of casualties due to pneumonia is putting pressure on disease control in many countries around the world.\n\n1. What is pneumonia?\nPneumonia is an inflammatory phenomenon of the lung parenchyma including inflammation of the alveoli, alveolar sacs, alveolar ducts, interstitial connective tissue and terminal bronchiolitis. The alveoli, the air passages in the lungs, can fill with fluid or pus, causing a cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills and difficulty breathing. Usually, there are many factors that cause pneumonia, but it is often caused by bacteria, viruses and fungi. Pneumonia has many different levels from mild inflammation to severe pneumonia. The disease is especially dangerous for infants, young children and people over 65 years old with many underlying diseases or weakened immune systems. (first)\nPneumonia can be classified in many different ways depending on the cause and purpose of classification, but in general, pneumonia is mainly classified based on the cause of pneumonia and the source of infection.\n1.1 Classification of pneumonia according to the cause of the disease\nBacterial pneumonia; Viral pneumonia; Fungal pneumonia; Chemical pneumonia\n1.2. Classification of pneumonia according to infectious cause\nHospital pneumonia; Community-acquired pneumonia\nPneumonia is dangerous for children and adults over 60 years old with underlying diseases\n\n2. Symptoms of pneumonia\nSymptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe, depending on factors such as the type of bacteria causing the pneumonia, the patient's age and overall health. Mild signs and symptoms are often similar to those of a cold or flu, but they last longer.\nSigns and symptoms of pneumonia may include:\nChest pain when you breathe or cough; Cough, cough with phlegm; Tired; Fever, sweats, and chills; In the elderly or immunocompromised, fever may not be present; Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea; Shortness of breath; Older people may be confused\nPneumonia in infants and young children may not have any warning signs of pneumonia. However, children may still show signs such as:\nVomiting; High fever, convulsions; Cough; Children are restless and tired; Children have difficulty breathing, stop feeding, and refuse to eat; Paleness, lethargy, chest indentation (2)\n\n3. Cause of pneumonia\n3.1. Bacterial pneumonia\nBacteria are the cause of most cases of community-acquired pneumonia in adults. Bacterial pneumonia is often transmitted through droplets (when healthy people inhale or swallow droplets filled with bacteria after an infected person coughs or sneezes). People with weakened immune systems and people with chronic underlying diseases are more susceptible to bacterial pneumonia than normal people.\nPneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria\n3.2. Pneumonia caused by viral infection\nCurrently, the most dangerous viral pneumonia is the SARS-CoV-2 virus. As of September 4, 2021, pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has attacked the world, infecting 220 million people, of whom over 4.56 million died. In addition, pneumonia can be caused by many other viruses that cause colds and flu. (3)\nPatients with severe pneumonia caused by Corona virus attack\n3.3. Fungal pneumonia\nThis type of pneumonia is caused by inhaling fungal spores and is common in people with chronic health problems or weakened immune systems. Fungal pneumonia develops very quickly, when inhaled fungal spores stick to the lungs. People who smoke and live in dusty, moldy environments are susceptible to fungal pneumonia.\n3.4. Chemical pneumonia\nChemical pneumonia is also known as aspiration pneumonia. This is a very rare, but highly dangerous pneumonia. Chemical pneumonia occurs in many different degrees. The severity of the condition will depend on: type of chemical, duration of exposure, patient's condition, first aid measures taken... In addition, chemicals that cause pneumonia can also harm many people. other agencies.\n3.5. Hospital pneumonia\nPneumonia that occurs 48 hours after admission to the hospital without the patient having had symptoms of pneumonia before. Hospital-acquired pneumonia is often caused by bacteria such as P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp, Enterobacteriacae, Haemophillus spp, S. aureus, Streptococcus spp.\n3.6. Community-acquired pneumonia\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia refers to all types of pneumonia that are not hospital-acquired pneumonia. The causes of community-acquired pneumonia are very diverse, the most common are bacterial and viral pneumonia.\n\n4. Subjects susceptible to pneumonia\n4.1. Children\nChildren under 5 years old, especially those under 2 months old, are the age group at highest risk of contracting and dying from pneumonia. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), each year about 150 million episodes of pneumonia occur in children in developing countries, of which about 11 million are hospitalized. Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of death in children under 5 years old. This organization also estimates that every day about 4,300 children die from pneumonia worldwide. In Vietnam alone, each year about 2.9 million children get pneumonia and about 4,000 children die from pneumonia.\n4.2. Pregnant women\nDuring pregnancy, women's immune system weakens, making them vulnerable to viruses and bacteria. Therefore, pregnant women are susceptible to pneumonia. Pneumonia during pregnancy can seriously affect the health of the pregnant woman and the fetus. The disease will increase the risk of pregnancy complications, premature birth, and can cause miscarriage. In particular, normal people with mild pneumonia can be treated at home, and the disease can be cured in about 2 to 3 weeks. For pregnant women, if suspected of having pneumonia, they should immediately seek medical attention and receive treatment as prescribed by a doctor to avoid affecting the fetus.\n4.3. Elder\nOlder people have weak health and poor adaptability, so during the rainy and sunny seasons, they are susceptible to respiratory diseases, including pneumonia. Elderly people with pneumonia if not treated promptly will lead to many complications, typically respiratory failure.\n4.4. Other risk factors\nHospital patients are at higher risk of pneumonia if you are in a hospital intensive care unit, especially if you are on a breathing machine (ventilator).\nPeople with chronic illnesses are more likely to get pneumonia if they have asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or heart disease.\nSmoking damages the body's natural defense system against bacteria and viruses that cause pneumonia.\nWeakened or suppressed immune systems such as those with HIV/AIDS, who have had an organ transplant, or who receive chemotherapy or long-term steroids are at risk of developing pneumonia.(4)\n\n5. Method of diagnosing pneumonia\nPneumonia can have clear clinical symptoms, but there are also many cases of pneumonia that are asymptomatic. The doctor will base on the medical condition and prescribe laboratory tests for the patient to perform tests to diagnose and find the cause of pneumonia.\n5.1. Clinical examination\nThe doctor will ask your medical history to look for signs of cough, difficulty breathing, fever and other accompanying symptoms. At the same time, look for dangerous signs such as difficulty breathing, paleness, lethargy...; Count breathing rates to monitor how fast or slow the patient is breathing; Listen to the lungs to find abnormal crackles: moist crackles, crackles, etc.\n5.2. Subclinical\nBlood test: Check lung infection through white blood cell count.; Sputum culture: Looks for bacteria or fungi causing lung infections. From there, the doctor finds the best antibiotic to treat the infection.; Chest X-ray: Chest X-ray helps diagnose pneumonia. On X-ray, images of parenchymal damage such as damage to the alveoli and lung interstitium will appear.\nResults of chest X-ray\nCT scan: This method plays a particularly important role in the diagnosis of lung opacities. Find even the smallest or most subtle injuries that X-rays miss.; CT scan: This method plays a particularly important role in the diagnosis of lung opacities. Find even the smallest or most subtle injuries that X-rays miss.\nBronchoscopy: This is a procedure that helps doctors observe the respiratory tract with a flexible scope (bronchoscope) to diagnose lung diseases. Additionally, the procedure allows the doctor to take samples of lung tissue, cells, or fluid.; Bronchoscopy: This is a procedure that helps doctors observe the respiratory tract with a flexible scope (bronchoscope) to diagnose lung diseases. Additionally, the procedure allows the doctor to take samples of lung tissue, cells, or fluid.\nThe combined clinical and paraclinical process helps doctors differentiate pneumonia from other dangerous diseases such as foreign bodies in the airway, asthma, congenital lung disease, or other causes of respiratory failure. such as cardiovascular disease (heart failure, congenital heart disease)...\n\n6. Dangerous complications of pneumonia\nEven with treatment, some people with pneumonia, especially those in high-risk groups, may experience complications, including:\n6.1. Sepsis\nBacteria that enter the bloodstream from the lungs can spread infection to other organs, potentially causing organ failure.\n6.2. Respiratory failure\nIf your pneumonia is severe or you have chronic lung diseases, you may have difficulty breathing and need oxygen. You may need to be hospitalized and use a ventilator (ventilator) until your lungs heal.\n6.3. Pleural effusion\nPneumonia can cause fluid to build up in the thin space between the layers of tissue lining the lungs and the chest cavity (pleura). If the amount of fluid in the pleural space increases and causes difficulty breathing, you may need to have the fluid drained or drained.\n6.4. Lung abscess\nAn abscess occurs if pus forms in a cavity in the lung. Abscesses are usually treated with antibiotics. Sometimes, surgery or drainage with a needle or long tube placed into the abscess is necessary to remove the pus.\n\n7. Treatment methods for pneumonia\nPneumonia treatment involves curing the infection and preventing complications. People with community-acquired pneumonia can usually be treated at home with medication. However, according to doctor Nguyen Thi Mong Trinh, respiratory specialist, Department of Examination, Tam Anh General Hospital: \"All cases of pneumonia in children under 2 months are considered serious and require hospitalization for treatment.\"\n7.1. Treatment at home\nMost symptoms subside within a few days or weeks; the feeling of fatigue may last for a month or more. When treated at home, your doctor will prescribe medication according to the cause of pneumonia. At the same time, get an appointment to go to the hospital for a follow-up examination as directed, or go to the hospital immediately if there are complications such as difficulty breathing, high fever that does not go down...\n7.2. Hospital treatment\nAdults with severe pneumonia with signs of labored breathing should be taken to the hospital for timely treatment. Particularly for infants under 2 months old with symptoms of pneumonia, they must be hospitalized immediately. Children 2-5 years old who do not eat or drink, have convulsions, are lethargic - difficult to wake up, or have whistling breathing must be immediately hospitalized for treatment.\n7.3. Medicines for pneumonia patients\nMedications to treat pneumonia depend on the type of pneumonia and severity of the pneumonia, and the patient's age and overall health. Doctors often prescribe treatment medications including:\nAntibiotics\nThese medications are used to treat bacterial pneumonia. It can take time to determine the type of bacteria causing pneumonia and choose the best antibiotic to treat it. If your symptoms do not improve, your doctor may recommend a different antibiotic.\nFever reducers/pain relievers\nPatients can use these medications when needed to reduce fever. These include medications such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).\n\n8. How to prevent pneumonia\n8.1. Vaccination\nCurrently, vaccines are available to prevent some pneumonia and flu diseases. In particular, vaccines to prevent pneumonia in children are widely used. Doctors recommend other pneumonia vaccines for children under 2 years old, and children 2 to 5 years old are at particular risk for pneumococcal disease. To prevent this disease, there is PCV 10 vaccine, trade name Synflorix, which helps prevent 10 different strains of pneumococcal bacteria. For adult pneumonia, there are currently many types of Covid-19 vaccines such as: AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson's Janssen...\n8.2. Increase hygiene\nTo protect yourself from respiratory infections that sometimes lead to pneumonia, wash your hands frequently or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and wear a mask. You need to rinse your mouth every day with salt water or antiseptic solution. This habit helps kill bacteria in the throat, dilute phlegm, open the airways and minimize complications due to infection.\n8.3. No active or passive smoking\nCigarette smoke has the potential to damage the lungs' natural defenses against respiratory infections.\n8.4. Keep the immune system strong\nWays to strengthen the immune system are: get enough sleep, exercise regularly and eat healthy.\n\n9. How to care for patients with pneumonia\n9.1. Rest\nChildren with symptoms of pneumonia should not go to school. People with viral pneumonia also need to rest, limit communication, and go to work until they recover.\n9.2. Stay hydrated\nDrink plenty of fluids, especially water, to help thin the mucus in the lungs, making it easier to cough up.\n9.3. Take medication as prescribed\nUse correctly and fully according to prescription. Stopping medication too early when symptoms are relieved will cause the lungs to continue to contain bacteria, slowly multiplying and causing a relapse of pneumonia.\n9.4. Ensure a clean living environment\nInfectious pneumonia is very dangerous, so it is necessary to ensure hygiene and prevent infection by regularly changing bedsheets, mats, and blankets for patients. In the case of taking care of an elderly person with acute pneumonia who is in a coma and has to stay in bed for a long time, relatives should let the patient use antibacterial diapers to help ensure better personal hygiene. .\n\nQuestions about pneumonia\n1. Can a blood test tell if you have pneumonia?\nBlood tests can help determine infection through white blood cell counts. The doctor can take blood from the vein for culture, helping to determine the type of bacteria causing the disease in cases of pneumonia complicated by sepsis. However, to determine the type of bacteria causing pneumonia, a sputum test is usually used.\n2. Is a newborn's cough due to pneumonia?\nThe most common symptoms in infants with pneumonia are coughing and coughing up wet mucus or phlegm. However, the initial signs of pneumonia in newborns are often poor and unclear, such as poor feeding or refusal to breastfeed, fever above 37.5 degrees Celsius or hypothermia, rapid breathing over 60 times in 1 minute or difficulty breathing. .\n3. Is bronchiolitis pneumonia?\nBronchiolitis and pneumonia both have some relatively similar symptoms that cause confusion. However, the difference is that bronchiolitis causes inflammation of the small branch tubes in the lungs, while pneumonia is an infection inside the lungs.\n4. Does pneumonia require hospitalization?\nNot all cases of pneumonia in children require hospital treatment. Children can be treated at home if the severity is mild to avoid further infection with bacteria and viruses at the hospital, called nosocomial infections.\n5. Does pneumonia require anything to avoid?\nMany studies have shown that foods high in salt, meat, and starch are the causes of increased phlegm and cough. People who eat a lot of meat, refined starches and sodium have an increased risk of persistent coughs than people who eat a lot of beans and fruit. Therefore, when you have pneumonia, you should limit eating red meat, processed foods, and refined grains.\n6. Does pneumonia require antibiotics?\nNormally, acute pneumonia caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, etc. is usually treated with antibiotics for a period of 7-14 days. For severe cases of pneumonia with symptoms of difficulty breathing and shortness of breath, antibiotic treatment is required for 15 - 20 days.\n7. Can pneumonia go away on its own?\nAccording to statistics, there are more than 50 types of pneumonia ranging from mild to severe. Pneumonia can also go away on its own, but there are also many cases of fatal complications such as pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, people with symptoms of suspected pneumonia need to be examined at reputable medical centers and hospitals. Do not subjectively think that pneumonia can go away on its own without treatment or improper treatment leading to dangerous complications.\n8. Is pneumonia dangerous?\nPneumonia is a relatively dangerous disease with many unpredictable complications. In particular, pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is threatening global health. Currently, the number of people dying from Covid-19 infection still shows no signs of cooling down. Therefore, you should have proactive methods to prevent pneumonia for yourself and your family by maintaining hygiene, wearing a mask, washing your hands regularly, and limiting contact with crowded places when the Covid-19 epidemic is not yet established. controlled.\n9. Can pneumonia be cured?\nPneumonia can be completely treated if detected promptly. Treatment methods need to be appropriate to each symptom and development of the disease. However, in some cases when the disease has become severe, treatment will be extremely difficult.\n10. Are pneumonia and lung cancer similar or different?\nPneumonia and lung cancer both have some similar symptoms such as cough, chest tightness, fatigue, and loss of appetite. Both have the most common symptom of cough, however cough due to lung cancer will be a persistent cough lasting over 2 weeks, using antibiotics but the condition does not improve, especially cough accompanied by blood. alert. Usually, patients with early stage lung cancer often have unclear symptoms, which are easily confused with other diseases. Therefore, patients need to be examined and use additional paraclinical tests for an accurate diagnosis.\n11. Does pneumonia recur?\nNowadays, it is not uncommon for childhood pneumonia to recur many times. Recurrent pneumonia can lead to serious complications, even death.\n12. Does pneumonia cause diarrhea and back pain?\nPneumonia can cause diarrhea and vomiting in adults and children. In addition, pneumonia occurs when the thin membrane that lines and protects the lung cavity is seriously damaged. The disease causes sharp pain in the back behind the lungs, possibly accompanied by high fever and cough.\nTo learn about the cost of examination and treatment of pneumonia, please contact: Tam Anh Hanoi General Hospital System: 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Bo De Ward, Long Bien District, Hanoi City.

            "subsection_content": "1. Can a blood test tell if you have pneumonia?\nBlood tests can help determine infection through white blood cell counts. The doctor can take blood from the vein for culture, helping to determine the type of bacteria causing the disease in cases of pneumonia complicated by sepsis. However, to determine the type of bacteria causing pneumonia, a sputum test is usually used.\n2. Is a newborn's cough due to pneumonia?\nThe most common symptoms in infants with pneumonia are coughing and coughing up wet mucus or phlegm. However, the initial signs of pneumonia in newborns are often poor and unclear, such as poor feeding or refusal to breastfeed, fever above 37.5 degrees Celsius or hypothermia, rapid breathing over 60 times in 1 minute or difficulty breathing. .\n3. Is bronchiolitis pneumonia?\nBronchiolitis and pneumonia both have some relatively similar symptoms that cause confusion. However, the difference is that bronchiolitis causes inflammation of the small branch tubes in the lungs, while pneumonia is an infection inside the lungs.\n4. Does pneumonia require hospitalization?\nNot all cases of pneumonia in children require hospital treatment. Children can be treated at home if the severity is mild to avoid further infection with bacteria and viruses at the hospital, called nosocomial infections.\n5. Does pneumonia require anything to avoid?\nMany studies have shown that foods high in salt, meat, and starch are the causes of increased phlegm and cough. People who eat a lot of meat, refined starches and sodium have an increased risk of persistent coughs than people who eat a lot of beans and fruit. Therefore, when you have pneumonia, you should limit eating red meat, processed foods, and refined grains.\n6. Does pneumonia require antibiotics?\nNormally, acute pneumonia caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, etc. is usually treated with antibiotics for a period of 7-14 days. For severe cases of pneumonia with symptoms of difficulty breathing and shortness of breath, antibiotic treatment is required for 15 - 20 days.\n7. Can pneumonia go away on its own?\nAccording to statistics, there are more than 50 types of pneumonia ranging from mild to severe. Pneumonia can also go away on its own, but there are also many cases of fatal complications such as pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, people with symptoms of suspected pneumonia need to be examined at reputable medical centers and hospitals. Do not subjectively think that pneumonia can go away on its own without treatment or improper treatment leading to dangerous complications.\n8. Is pneumonia dangerous?\nPneumonia is a relatively dangerous disease with many unpredictable complications. In particular, pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is threatening global health. Currently, the number of people dying from Covid-19 infection still shows no signs of cooling down. Therefore, you should have proactive methods to prevent pneumonia for yourself and your family by maintaining hygiene, wearing a mask, washing your hands regularly, and limiting contact with crowded places when the Covid-19 epidemic is not yet established. controlled.\n9. Can pneumonia be cured?\nPneumonia can be completely treated if detected promptly. Treatment methods need to be appropriate to each symptom and development of the disease. However, in some cases when the disease has become severe, treatment will be extremely difficult.\n10. Are pneumonia and lung cancer similar or different?\nPneumonia and lung cancer both have some similar symptoms such as cough, chest tightness, fatigue, and loss of appetite. Both have the most common symptom of cough, however cough due to lung cancer will be a persistent cough lasting over 2 weeks, using antibiotics but the condition does not improve, especially cough accompanied by blood. alert. Usually, patients with early stage lung cancer often have unclear symptoms, which are easily confused with other diseases. Therefore, patients need to be examined and use additional paraclinical tests for an accurate diagnosis.\n11. Does pneumonia recur?\nNowadays, it is not uncommon for childhood pneumonia to recur many times. Recurrent pneumonia can lead to serious complications, even death.\n12. Does pneumonia cause diarrhea and back pain?\nPneumonia can cause diarrhea and vomiting in adults and children. In addition, pneumonia occurs when the thin membrane that lines and protects the lung cavity is seriously damaged. The disease causes sharp pain in the back behind the lungs, possibly accompanied by high fever and cough.\nTo learn about the cost of examination and treatment of pneumonia, please contact: Tam Anh Hanoi General Hospital System: 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Bo De Ward, Long Bien District, Hanoi City.
