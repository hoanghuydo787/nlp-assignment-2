    "content": "Chronic enteritis: Causes, symptoms and treatment\n\nChronic enteritis is the result of an excessive, prolonged immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. The disease needs to be diagnosed and treated early to prevent possible dangerous complications.\n\nWhat is chronic enteritis?\nChronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestinal tract including two main groups: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (regional enteritis). The pathogenesis of chronic enteritis is still unknown. However, interactions between environmental factors, the body's immune factors, the patient's microbiome, and genetics play an important role. In recent years, people have noted abnormalities in the intestinal microflora in Crohn's disease, with an increase in some pathogenic bacteria strains such as E.Coli, proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and a decrease in Firmicutes and Bacteroides strains. (2)\n\nCauses of chronic enteritis\nEnvironmental factors thought to have an impact on the development of the disease include smoking, use of anti-inflammatory NSAIDs, use of immunosuppressive drugs or hormone replacement.\nGenetic factors are highly related to both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease when the incidence of the disease in family members or identical twins is very high, up to 35% of the risk of IBD in family members. and 30% risk in identical twins. The most common age for Crohn's disease is between 20 and 30 years old, and the second age group is usually after 60 years old.\nSmoking increases the risk of Crohn's disease and increases complications of strictures, fistulas, and the need for surgery. A diet high in fiber and fruit reduces the risk of Crohn's disease, while eating a lot of animal fat or unsaturated fatty acids increases the risk of Crohn's disease. Vitamin D deficiency is common in Crohn's disease.(1)\nCurrently, the incidence of IBD is tending to increase in the Asian population, the overall incidence varies from 1 to 16/100,000 people. In Asia, 36% of cases were diagnosed after complications of intestinal stricture or perforation compared to only 5% in Australia.\n\nSymptoms of chronic enteritis\nUlcerative colitis has a common symptom of bleeding. In addition, patients may have mild fever, urgent diarrhea, tenesmus, bowel movements at night, weight loss, and abdominal cramps. Lesions in ulcerative colitis are often continuous, superficial ulcers and spread from the rectum up.\nCrohn's disease has common symptoms of diarrhea lasting more than 6 weeks, and continuous diarrhea, in some cases more than 20 times a day, causing weight loss. Some other common symptoms are abdominal pain of varying nature, weight loss, and mild fever. Common location of damage in intermittent Crohn's disease: 75% in the ileum (last part of the small intestine), 30 - 40% of the small intestine alone, 15 - 25% only in the colon, 40 - 55% distributed both in the small intestine and colon. Up to 40% of CROHN patients have perianal manifestations such as excess skin folds, prolapsed hemorrhoids, and anal fistula. 35% may have fistulas between the digestive tract and organs in the body (bladder and vaginal fistulas) or leak into the skin, abdomen, or retroperitoneal space.(3)\nIn children, the disease often causes slow growth and delayed puberty. In addition, up to 25% of IBD cases manifest through non-gastrointestinal symptoms. Symptoms that may occur or affect patients outside the gastrointestinal tract include joint pain. A common case is pain in peripheral joints such as ankles, knees or small joints in the fingers. Men often have pain and limited movement of the spine. Other organs can occur in the eyes causing episcleritis and uveitis, in the skin causing erythema nodosum, dermatitis gangrene, leg ulcers, hepatobiliary manifestations causing obstructive jaundice, and hematologic manifestations. causes anemia…\n\nDiagnosis of chronic inflammatory bowel disease\nThere is currently no gold standard for diagnosing IBD. The doctor needs to combine clinical examination, colonoscopy, computed tomography or MRI and histological results from endoscopic biopsy. In addition, increased inflammatory markers in the blood such as CRP and calprotectin in the blood are also a sign that helps point to the disease. It is necessary to differentiate chronic colitis from acute inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal tuberculosis or irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nTreatment of chronic enteritis\nTreatment of IBD is challenging and complex. IBD is a progressive, relapsing disease. Particularly for Crohn's disease, more than 80% of cases require hospitalization. More than 50% of cases require intestinal resection surgery within the first 10 years of disease detection.\nCurrently, there is still no evidence of clinical cure. The risk of colon cancer also increases after 8-10 years of disease. This risk is 6 times greater than that of people without IBD.\nRegarding treatment, it is necessary to identify risk factors, evaluate clinical and endoscopic transcripts to group mild or severe forms to help guide treatment and patient prognosis. High-risk patients are diagnosed at a young age (<30 years old), are current smokers, have increased CRP and/or increased fecal Calprotectin.\nCalprotectin >100 ug/gr indicates the possibility of endoscopic recurrence with a sensitivity of 89%; >160 ug/gr predicts recurrence when patients are in clinical regression while on anti-TNF treatment with a sensitivity of 91.7% and specificity of 83%; ≥350 ug/gr helps predict relapse in stable Crohn's disease patients who have stopped anti-TNF.\nOn the other hand, deep or long ulcers on endoscopy, presence of perianal pathology, extra-gastrointestinal manifestations such as lesions in the skin, joints, iris, history of bowel surgery, corticosteroid dependence or corticosteroid resistance are factors. poor prognostic factor for the disease. Smoking increases disease activity and increases the relapse rate after stopping anti-TNF. Therefore, stopping smoking is very important.\nNSAIDs have been associated with disease onset and should be avoided in patients with IBD. Anxiety, stress, and depression affect quality of life and hinder treatment compliance. Therefore, physicians need to fully assess anxiety and neuropsychiatric disorders in the care and management of this patient group.\nTreatment of chronic enteritis, specifically:\nIn mild cases, doctors may only be able to use topical corticosteroids or Sulfasalazine to control symptoms.; Moderate and severe cases require individualized treatment. In young patients with extensive lesions, deep ulcers, corticosteroid dependence or corticosteroid resistance, early treatment with biological drugs combined with immunomodulators (Azathiopurine, methotrexate) is needed.\nCurrently, in Vietnam, anti-TNF (including two drugs Adalimumab and Infliximab) is used quite commonly in severe cases. When using biological drugs, it is necessary to pay attention to the risk of outbreaks of infection, latent tuberculosis and viral hepatitis. Therefore, screening and treatment to prevent reactivation of tuberculosis and viral hepatitis is essential before treating IBD with biological drugs. Anti-adhesion drugs or anti-Interleukin 12/23 play a role in cases of anti-TNF resistance, promising many options in the future.\nPatients with chronic colitis often have intestinal ulcers, reduced absorption and decreased appetite with protein loss through the digestive tract. It is necessary to ensure reasonable nutritional needs, correct micronutrient deficiencies and improve digestive symptoms. Intravenous nutrition is not recommended, total nutrition is indicated in cases of intestinal obstruction, short bowel syndrome or after surgery. Limit hard-to-absorb fibers, coffee, and alcohol. Patients in the advanced stage with fistula lesions and diarrhea causing a lot of protein loss need to provide a lot of protein in their diet, 1-1.5 grams/kg. Supplement micronutrient deficiencies such as iron, Vitamin B12, folic acid, vitamin D, magnesium, zinc.\nCenter for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City) and Department of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreatic (Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing High-end, effective examination and treatment services for patients with mild to severe liver and intestinal problems (fatty liver, acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer, enteritis , gastroenteritis, intestinal bleeding...). Tam Anh General Hospital system brings together a team of highly specialized and experienced Internal Medicine - Surgery - Gastrointestinal Endoscopy doctors, in addition to the support of a modern medical equipment system imported from abroad. in addition, serving the maximum examination and treatment needs of customers.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of liver diseases with gastroenterology specialists of Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nChronic enteritis is a disease that needs to be treated as soon as possible. Patients should go to reputable medical facilities for diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",
