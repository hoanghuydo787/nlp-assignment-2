    "content": "Acute appendicitis: Causes, signs and prevention\n\nAcute appendicitis is the most common emergency condition in abdominal surgery and needs to be detected and treated early to avoid dangerous complications. Typical signs include pain in the right iliac fossa and symptoms that vary widely depending on each patient. In almost all cases, appendectomy is the most optimal solution to avoid organ rupture or necrosis.\n\nWhat is acute appendicitis?\nAcute appendicitis is a condition of bacterial infection in the lumen of the appendix, which can be caused by: Hyperplasia of the appendix, fecal stones, parasites (roundworms burrowing into the appendix), foreign objects (fruit seeds). )… This is a medical emergency and needs to be treated promptly to avoid dangerous complications. If inflammation persists, the infection can spread into the abdominal cavity - the area of ​​the body containing the liver, pancreas, intestines... seriously threatening life. Accordingly, the optimal treatment method is to use antibiotics combined with surgical excision.\nAcute appendicitis can occur at any age but is most common between 10 and 20 years old. Among them, men predominate, with a male/female ratio of 1.4:1.\nAcute appendicitis is caused by an infectious agent\n\nCause of acute appendicitis\nAcute appendicitis often occurs due to a blockage of the appendix, increasing internal pressure and circulatory stagnation. At this time, bacteria begin to multiply and accumulate pus, thereby further damaging the intestinal wall, leading to pain and irritation. If the inflammation does not improve, part of the intestinal wall may become necrotic, leading to the formation of a hole, at which point pus and fecal fluid flow into the abdomen. This is a medical emergency, requiring urgent treatment intervention.(1)\nBesides the cause of obstruction due to fecal stones, infection can also occur due to a number of other factors such as:\nParasites (Roundworms burrow into the intestines).; Foreign bodies in the intestines, typically fruit seeds; Regional lymphatic hyperplasia, more common in people with disorders that lead to intestinal inflammation, such as: Diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.; Tumors in the appendix (this is very rare).\nBacteria multiply in the inflamed appendix\n\nSymptoms of acute appendicitis\nSymptoms of acute appendicitis often appear quickly and suddenly, starting with abdominal pain in the right iliac fossa, initially in the area above the umbilicus or around the umbilicus and then gradually localized in the right iliac fossa. The appendix can become necrotic or rupture within 24 - 72 hours, so timely treatment is required to avoid danger to life. Some recognizable signs include: (3)\nNausea and vomiting (especially in children).; Digestive disorders such as: anorexia, constipation, diarrhea...; Patients may feel tired and have a fever; Dry lips, dirty tongue.\n1. Symptoms of acute appendicitis during pregnancy\nIn the first 6 months of pregnancy, symptoms of acute appendicitis are not much different from normal women, typically:\nNausea.; Vomiting.; Cramp.\nIf nausea, vomiting and cramps persist, the person should seek emergency medical attention. In addition, the uterus can also push the appendix several centimeters into the upper abdomen, especially in the last 3 months. In this case, the pain from appendicitis often occurs in the upper right side of the abdomen and behind the back, instead of just appearing in the usual location (lower right side of the abdomen).\nDuring the last 3 months of pregnancy, acute appendicitis is often difficult to diagnose because of reduced abdominal wall sensitivity and effects on female hormones. It is especially important to note that appendicitis progresses very quickly in pregnant women, leading to necrosis, so correct diagnosis and early intervention are essential to protect the lives of the mother and fetus.\n2. Symptoms of acute appendicitis in children and adolescents\nChildren are more likely to get acute appendicitis, especially between the ages of 10 and 16. Young children experiencing this condition often have difficulty describing specific symptoms. Therefore, parents should monitor closely to easily recognize through the following signs:\nAbdominal pain, bending the right leg to the abdomen.; Fever.; Diarrhea, vomiting.; Tossing and turning and crying; Abdominal bloating\nAcute appendicitis in children is often confused with gastroenteritis. Misdiagnosis can increase the risk of necrosis and rupture of the appendix.\nAbdominal cramps with acute appendicitis\n\nDiagnosis of acute appendicitis\nSigns of acute appendicitis can easily be confused with other medical conditions, such as:\nUrinary tract infection (UTI).; Gastric and duodenal ulcer; Cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis; Intestinal infections, diverticulitis; Right lower lobe lung inflammation; Women may be confused with gynecological diseases: Adnexitis, ruptured corpus luteum, torsion of ovarian cysts...; Children: Intussusception.; Elderly people: Intestinal obstruction, cecal tumor.\nIn addition, the exact location of appendicitis is different in each case, so it is difficult to distinguish. To make a clear diagnosis, doctors will often prescribe many different tests, including:\nPhysical examination of the abdomen.; Rectal examination; Blood test to determine the number of white blood cells, thereby helping to detect infection.; Diagnostic imaging tests: Abdominal ultrasound, CT scan, abdominal MRI.; Urine test, to rule out urinary tract infection.\n\nComplications of acute appendicitis\nAcute appendicitis is an emergency condition that can lead to death if not treated promptly. Some dangerous complications that need to be warned include:\n1. Perforation of the appendix\nWhen the appendix is ​​blocked, the fluid and mucus inside cannot escape, but instead accumulate, increasing pressure inside the organ. This leads to swelling and stimulates harmful bacteria to multiply. From here, the blood supply to the appendix is ​​inhibited. In the long term, reduced blood flow and untreated wounds will lead to cell death, tissue becoming spongy or holes forming. This condition is called a ruptured or perforated appendix.\nThe most worrying consequence is the leakage of bacteria and pus out of the organ and into surrounding tissues, leading to peritonitis. This is a very serious condition, causing pain to the patient and requiring urgent medical intervention. In addition to peritonitis, abscesses and gangrene are also dangerous complications.\nSymptoms of appendicitis perforation have the risk of getting worse over time. Severity also varies between cases. However, all patients need professional medical care for reasonable and effective treatment solutions.\n2. Peritonitis\nPeritonitis is not common, but if it occurs, it is a medical emergency because of the danger it causes. This is an infection that spreads from the appendix to the lining of the abdominal cavity. A typical symptom is pain, the level of pain becomes more severe as the infection spreads.\nNormally, a perforated appendix will cause pain to the peritoneum closest to the appendix, then spread further. Symptoms become worse when the patient bends the hip, coughs, or is subjected to pressure or touching. Some other accompanying signs include:\nFever, body temperature of 38 degrees C / 100.4 degrees F or higher; Chills.; Diarrhea or decreased intestinal motility (ileus).; Low blood pressure.; Heart beating fast.; Low urine output.; Sepsis.; Abscess around the appendix\nThis is the most common complication that occurs due to a perforated appendix. Specifically, an abscess is a collection of pus that forms in a tissue, space, or organ in the body. People experiencing this condition may have abdominal pain and high fever, but because they are quite common symptoms, it is difficult to diagnose accurately with a regular medical examination. Accordingly, abdominal ultrasound or CT scan is commonly prescribed to determine whether an abscess has formed.\nIf the abscess is small, the patient will be injected with antibiotics intravenously to reduce its size. Surgery to remove the appendix was also performed a few weeks later. During this time, the doctor will closely monitor the condition.\nIf the abscess is larger or has many different pockets of pus, the doctor will perform drainage and inject intravenous antibiotics. If the condition improves, the drain will be reinserted until the abscess is cleared. Surgery to remove the appendix continued a few weeks later. In the case of a large, multi-compartment abscess, surgical drainage needs to be performed quickly. Surgical excision can also be performed at the same time if it is safe for the patient.\n\nTreatment of acute appendicitis\nFor acute appendicitis, the patient will need immediate surgery to remove the organ. If left for too long, the risk of rupture will be very high. Accordingly, two commonly applied surgical methods include: (2)\nLaparoscopic surgery: The doctor will make a small cut in the abdomen to remove the appendix.; Open surgery: The doctor will make a single incision in the lower right side of the abdomen to remove the appendix.; If the appendix ruptures, at risk of causing serious infection in the abdomen, the surgeon will perform a parallel operation to remove the appendix and clean the abdomen.\n\nDoes acute appendicitis require surgery?\nIn rare cases, antibiotics can effectively treat mild acute appendicitis. However, most patients need urgent surgical intervention to avoid dangerous complications.\nSurgery to remove the appendix is ​​necessary to prevent dangerous complications\n\nHow to prevent acute appendicitis\nAcute appendicitis cannot be prevented. This condition can occur when a piece of food, stool or foreign object gets stuck in an organ, causing irritation or infection. Bacteria grow rapidly, leading to infection.\nThe Center for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City) and the Department of General Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing medical examination services. and advanced, effective treatment for patients with mild to severe liver problems (fatty liver, acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer...). Tam Anh General Hospital system brings together a team of highly specialized and experienced Internal Medicine - Surgery - Gastrointestinal Endoscopy doctors, in addition to the support of a modern medical equipment system imported from abroad. in addition, serving the maximum examination and treatment needs of customers.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of liver diseases with gastroenterology specialists of Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nAbove is a summary of all information related to acute appendicitis, causes, typical symptoms and effective treatment methods. Hopefully through these shares, you will have more useful updates to proactively monitor and detect diseases early.",
