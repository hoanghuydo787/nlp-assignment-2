    "content": "Appendicitis: Causes, signs and prevention\n\nAppendicitis can occur at any age, typically with pain appearing around the navel and gradually spreading to nearby locations. This is an emergency condition that needs to be treated promptly to avoid spreading and life-threatening infection. In necessary cases, surgical intervention will be indicated to remove the damaged area.\n\nWhat is appendicitis?\nAppendicitis is a condition in which the appendix becomes inflamed due to a number of typical causes, such as: invasion of microorganisms, tumors, waste obstruction... This leads to pain around the navel. and gradually spread to neighboring locations.\nAccordingly, the appendix is ​​a thin tube connected to the large intestine, located in the lower right part of the abdomen. For young children, this organ is part of the immune system, helping to protect the body against disease. For adults, the appendix has completely stopped this task; its exact function is still being researched.\nAppendicitis can occur in anyone, with the most common being people between the ages of 10 and 30 years old. Up to now, the standard treatment is surgical excision of the affected area. (first)\nInflammation of the appendix in the digestive system\n\nWhat causes appendicitis?\nAppendicitis can occur due to the following typical causes:\nInvasion of viruses, bacteria or parasites in the digestive tract.; The tube connecting the large intestine and appendix is ​​blocked by feces/; Tumor.\nAll of these factors can cause the appendix to become inflamed and painful. The process of transporting blood to the organ will stop when the swelling becomes more severe. When blood flow is insufficient, the appendix begins to die. In addition, the organ is also at risk of rupturing or forming holes or tears in the intestinal wall. This causes feces, mucus, viruses, bacteria... to leak into the abdominal cavity, leading to a series of other dangerous problems such as peritonitis, spreading infection...\nHarmful microorganisms invade and lead to appendicitis\n\nSigns of appendicitis\nTypical signs of acute appendicitis are abdominal pain, nausea and fever. When swelling and inflammation become more severe, the adjacent abdominal wall will be irritated, leading to pain localization in the right lower quadrant. This symptom is often not noticed in children under 3 years old.\nSpecifically, the initial sign is a dull pain around the navel, which after a few hours will move to the right lower quadrant. The abdominal wall has now become very sensitive to light pressure. If the appendix is ​​located behind the cecum, palpation in the right lower quadrant will not cause pain. Similarly, if the appendix is ​​completely located in the pelvis, the patient will not notice any stiffness in the abdomen at all, only feeling pain at McBurney's point when coughing. In such cases, digital rectal examination will often reveal damage to the rectal sac.(2)\n\nMethods of diagnosing appendicitis\nTo diagnose appendicitis, the doctor will initially review your medical history, typical symptoms and conduct some abdominal examinations as follows:\nPhysical exam to evaluate pain: The doctor may apply gentle pressure to the painful area. When pressure is applied suddenly, appendicitis pain tends to get worse, a sign that the neighboring peritoneum is also inflamed.; Physical exam to evaluate pain: The doctor may apply gentle pressure to the painful area. When pressure is suddenly applied, appendicitis pain tends to get worse, a sign that the neighboring peritoneum is also inflamed.\nCheck the stiffness of the abdomen: In this case, the patient tends to tense the abdominal muscles to react to the pressure exerted on the inflamed appendix area.; Check the stiffness of the abdomen: In this case, the patient tends to tense the abdominal muscles to react to the pressure exerted on the inflamed appendix area.\nExamination of the lower rectum: The doctor may use a lubricated gloved finger to examine the lower rectum.; Examination of the lower rectum: The doctor may use a lubricated gloved finger to examine the lower rectum.\nPelvic examination for women of reproductive age to check for painful gynecological problems (if any).; Pelvic examination for women of reproductive age to check for painful gynecological problems (if any).\nIn addition, some testing methods that may also be performed include:\nBlood test: This method will help the doctor check the number of white blood cells to detect infection (if any).; Blood test: This method will help the doctor check the number of white blood cells to detect infection (if any).\nUrine test: Your doctor may order a urine test to rule out a urinary tract infection or kidney stones as the cause of your pain.; Urine test: Your doctor may order a urine test to rule out a urinary tract infection or kidney stones as the cause of your pain.\nImaging tests: Your doctor may also recommend an abdominal X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to accurately determine appendicitis or detect other causes of pain; Imaging tests: Your doctor may also recommend an abdominal X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to accurately determine appendicitis or Identify other causes of pain.\nThe ultrasound doctor diagnosed inflammation in the appendix\n\nCommon forms of appendicitis\nTypes of appendicitis are classified as follows:(3)\n1. Based on the cause of blockage\nInfectious appendicitis: Obstruction of the lumen of the appendix due to infection; Fibrosing appendicitis: Scar tissue from previous surgery leads to blockage.; Appendicitis due to waste: Hard stool blocks the exit of the appendix; Neoplastic appendicitis: Carcinoid, adenocarcinoma or mucinous tumor are the cause of increased fluid secretion leading to obstruction of the appendix, causing inflammation.; Parasitic appendicitis: Obstruction of the appendix due to parasite invasion, causing inflammation; Appendicitis with stones: Obstruction of the intestinal lumen due to cell hyperplasia, leading to inflammation.\n2. Based on the degree of perforation\nPerforated appendicitis: The wall of the appendix has been damaged by pressure and inflammation, causing contents to leak into the peritoneal cavity. The incidence of the disease often tends to increase with age and is related to the infiltration of the following bacteria: Escherichia coli, streptococcus, Bacteroides fragilis, Pseudomonas.; Perforated appendicitis: The wall of the appendix has been damaged by pressure and inflammation, causing contents to leak into the peritoneal cavity. The incidence of the disease often tends to increase with age and is related to infiltration by the following bacteria: Escherichia coli, streptococcus, Bacteroides fragilis, Pseudomonas.\nNon-perforated appendicitis: Inflammation occurs only inside the appendix, there is no leakage.; Non-perforated appendicitis: Inflammation occurs only inside the appendix, without leakage.\n3. Based on the time of progression of symptoms\nAcute appendicitis: Symptoms of inflammation have occurred and have lasted less than 48 hours.; Chronic appendicitis: Symptoms have persisted for days, weeks, or have recurred multiple times.\n\nComplications of appendicitis\nIf appendicitis is not treated promptly, it can lead to serious complications as follows:\nRupture of the appendix: A ruptured appendix will spread infection throughout the abdomen, leading to peritonitis, which is life-threatening. This condition requires immediate surgery to remove the damaged area and clean the abdominal cavity.; Rupture of the appendix: A ruptured appendix will spread infection throughout the abdomen, leading to peritonitis, which is life-threatening. This condition requires immediate surgery to remove the damaged area and clean the abdominal cavity.\nAbscess: This is a condition where a pocket of pus forms in the abdomen. In most cases, the doctor will drain the abscess by placing a tube through the abdominal wall into the affected area. The tube is left in place for about two weeks and the patient is also given a combination of antibiotics to eliminate the infection. Surgical excision will then be indicated.; Abscess: This is a condition where a pocket of pus forms in the abdomen. In most cases, the doctor will drain the abscess by placing a tube through the abdominal wall into the affected area. The tube is left in place for about two weeks and the patient is also given a combination of antibiotics to eliminate the infection. Surgical excision will then be indicated.\nIf left untreated, appendicitis can lead to many dangerous complications\n\nTreatment of appendicitis\nThe doctor will base on the severity of the inflammation to prescribe appropriate treatment. As follows:\n1. Surgery to remove the appendix\nThis method can be performed as open surgery with an incision on the abdomen about 5 - 10cm long or laparoscopic surgery with a smaller incision. For the second procedure, the doctor will insert special instruments and a video camera into the abdomen to remove the damaged appendix. This method is often preferred because of its quick recovery time, less pain and scarring. Endoscopy is also more suitable for the elderly and obese people.(4)\nHowever, if the appendix has ruptured, the infection has spread or an abscess has appeared, the patient must undergo open surgery to clean the abdominal cavity. After surgery, the doctor will prescribe you to stay in the hospital for 1-2 days for monitoring and care.\n2. Drain the abscess before appendectomy\nIf the appendix has ruptured and an abscess has formed around it, the doctor will drain it by placing a tube through the skin into the pus. Organectomy is also performed several weeks later once the infection is controlled.\n3. Home care\nAfter an appendectomy due to inflammation, the patient needs to take the following care measures to ensure effective wound recovery:\nIn the early stages after surgery, patients need to avoid strenuous activities (about 3 - 5 days for laparoscopic surgery and 10 - 14 days for open surgery).; Place a pillow on your stomach and apply gentle pressure before coughing, laughing or moving to help relieve pain.; Contact your doctor if pain relievers are not effective to avoid slowing the wound healing process.; After the prescribed rest period, the person should begin light activity, such as short walks.; As your body recovers, the feeling of sleepiness will increase. At this time, rest comfortably as needed.\n\nPrevention of appendicitis\nThere is no absolute solution to prevent appendicitis. However, research shows that a diet rich in fiber may reduce the risk of disease. This food group includes:\nFruit.; Vegetable.; Beans (lentils, split peas...).; Oatmeal.; Brown rice.; Whole wheat and other whole grains.\n\nFrequently asked questions about appendicitis\n1. Is appendicitis dangerous?\nIf the inflammation is not treated, the appendix will burst, spreading harmful bacteria into the abdominal cavity, including the central part that contains the liver, stomach, and intestines. This leads to peritonitis, even death. However, the disease can be well controlled with prompt treatment with strong antibiotics and surgery.\n2. Caring for patients after appendicitis surgery\nLaparoscopic appendectomy usually has a quick recovery time. Patients can be discharged from the hospital after just a few days of treatment, even within 24 hours. With open surgery, the time can last up to a week.\nDuring the first few days after surgery, the patient will feel pain and show signs of bruising. This condition will improve over time, but pain relievers can also be used if necessary. Patients may also experience constipation for a short time after treatment. Helpful care solutions include taking codeine pain relievers, eating lots of fiber and drinking enough water.(6)\nBefore leaving the hospital, the doctor will advise you in detail about the wound treatment process as well as activities to avoid. Relatives need to pay attention to know how to properly care for them.\n3. How long is the incubation period for appendicitis?\nFor acute appendicitis: This is a case of serious inflammation, often occurring suddenly, most commonly between the ages of 10 and 30, especially in men. The pain tends to get worse within 24 hours.(5)\nFor chronic appendicitis: Symptoms may be relatively mild, often occurring after an acute case of inflammation. Accordingly, signs of pain tend to disappear before reappearing over a period of weeks, months or even years. This type of appendicitis can be difficult to diagnose, sometimes only being discovered when it develops acutely.\n4. Does appendicitis go away on its own?\nAppendicitis cannot go away on its own and must be surgically removed as soon as possible to avoid dangerous complications. This method is also often recommended when inflammation cannot be clearly diagnosed.(7)\nThe Center for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City) and the Department of General Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing medical examination services. and advanced, effective treatment for patients with mild to severe liver problems (fatty liver, acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer...). Tam Anh General Hospital system brings together a team of highly specialized and experienced Internal Medicine - Surgery - Gastrointestinal Endoscopy doctors, in addition to the support of a modern medical equipment system imported from abroad. in addition, serving the maximum examination and treatment needs of customers.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of liver diseases with gastroenterology specialists of Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nAbove is a summary of all information related to appendicitis, causes, symptoms, diagnosis and effective treatment methods.
