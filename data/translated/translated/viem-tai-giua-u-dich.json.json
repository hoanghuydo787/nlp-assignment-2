    "content": "Otitis media with effusion: Causes, symptoms and treatment\n\nOtitis media with effusion causes mild to moderate conductive hearing loss, ear pain and decline in learning and work. MScNT Nguyen Thi Huong, Department of Ear, Nose and Throat, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, said that otitis media with effusion is more common in children than in adults, especially in young children. Incidence varies by geographic location and race, environmental and socioeconomic factors. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the middle ear, often due to dysfunction of the Eustachian tube or the ciliary system or both. The most common presenting symptoms are mild to moderate conductive hearing loss, ear pain, and learning loss. Understanding otitis media with effusion, knowing how to prevent, detect early and treat the disease promptly will help patients avoid long-term consequences that can affect hearing and speech functions or slow development. in children.\nOtitis media with effusion is more common in children than adults\n\nWhat is otitis media with effusion?\nOtitis media with effusion (O.M.E), also known as otitis media with effusion. This is a condition of fluid accumulation in the middle ear due to incomplete treatment of acute otitis media or blockage of the ear canal without infection.\nThe eustachian tube, also known as the eustachian tube, is a tube that carries fluid from the ear to the back of the nose and throat. If the flow is blocked, fluid can become trapped in the middle ear cavity, leading to fluid retention.\n\nSubjects susceptible to otitis media with effusion\nDr. Huong said that anyone can have fluid retention in the ear, but the risk of it occurring in children is higher. This is because a child's Eustachian tube is smaller and tends to lie more horizontally than an adult's ear.\n\nCauses of otitis media with effusion\nFluid retention in the ear is caused by some form of Eustachian tube dysfunction. Common causes may include:(1)\nCold virus infection leads to ear infections;; Excessive VA;; Nearby tumors develop and block the Eustachian tube;; Chemical irritants such as cigarette smoke;; Radiation therapy in patients with head and neck cancers;; Trauma to the ear area, mainly caused by rapid changes in ambient air pressure, such as flying or scuba diving;; Have Down syndrome or cleft palate.\n\nSymptoms of otitis media with effusion\nAccording to Dr. Huong, the most common symptom of otitis media with effusion is mild to moderate conductive hearing loss. Earaches often accompany upper respiratory tract infections. Older children and adults can easily recognize hearing loss, but young children cannot recognize or describe the condition they experience.\nDue to hearing loss or impairment, patients tend to listen to the radio or television at a higher volume than usual. Patients may be stressed, distracted, and their speech, communication, and cognitive functions may also be affected. All of these can lead to a decline in work and study.\nIn addition, patients may feel heavy ears or ringing in the ears when swallowing or have eye pain, but cases of eye pain are very rare.\nVarious changes can also occur to the tympanic membrane (TM) including an amber or gray color of the eardrum, mild to severe shrinkage, etc. When the tympanic cavity is filled with fluid, the tympanic membrane may not move during surgery. tests and the level of air fluid or air bubbles can be seen through the eardrum.\n\nDiagnosis of otitis media with effusion\nDoctors can diagnose otitis media with effusion using the following methods:\n1. Otoscopy\nThis method uses an otoscope or endoscope to detect changes in the eardrum such as amber or opaque yellow color, increased blood vessels of the hammer head; The eardrum has shrinkage; stretch membrane has the shape of a bag; abnormally transparent eardrum; The tympanic cavity contains fluid, has a slightly watery level or air bubbles appear in the ear fluid; blue eardrum, especially in otitis media with mucus secretion.(4)\n2. Tympanometry\nMay be done to confirm the presence of middle ear fluid (i.e., by showing an immobile eardrum). This is the most reliable objective test to diagnose otitis media with effusion at any age. In addition, this method also helps screen and monitor treatment progress.\n3. Audiometry\nAudiometry is applied to children over 4 years old and adults, helping to assess the severity of the disease. This method can also be used to monitor the progress and effectiveness of treatment. The average hearing loss for mild otitis media with effusion is 23dB, for moderate it is 29dB and for severe it is 34dB.\nCurrently, Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City is using the Danish Interacoustic audiological function tester and the Danish Interacoustic cochlear sound measuring hearing loss diagnostic machine in medical examination and treatment. These are the two leading modern machines in the world today for accurate diagnosis, thereby greatly supporting doctors in providing effective, targeted treatment for otitis media with effusion and other diseases. Ear diseases in general.\nIn addition, Dr. Huong recommends that adults and adolescents need a nose and throat examination to rule out malignant tumors. There should be special suspicion for nasopharyngeal malignancy in cases of unilateral otitis media with effusion. If malignancy is suspected, imaging tests and pathologic biopsy should be performed next.\nOtitis media with effusion can be diagnosed using otoscopy\n\nHow to treat otitis media with effusion\nAccording to Dr. Huong, treatment of otitis media with effusion needs to be individualized. This depends on the causative agent, the duration of the disease, the severity of the hearing loss and the impact of the hearing loss.\nMild, uncomplicated otitis media can be treated conservatively with medications. For chronic or recurrent otitis media and severe hearing loss affecting language and speech, the treatment for otitis media with effusion is surgery, which should be prescribed early, especially in children.\n1. Conservative treatment\nTreatment with drugs is indicated for cases of otitis media with effusion after upper respiratory tract infection or in combination with upper respiratory tract infection caused by viruses, bacteria, adenoiditis, tonsillitis and other infections. sinus infection.\nAntibiotics\nFor chronic otitis media with effusion, long-term antibiotic treatment may help manage the infection.(2)\nAntihistamines and decongestants\nCommonly used in the treatment of otitis media with effusion. Patients can use it alone or in combination to reduce blockage of the Eustachian tube.\nMucus thinning medication\nIn cases of otitis media with purulent fluid, mucus thinners are very beneficial for clearing fluid through the Eustachian tube.\nSteroids\nIf otitis media with effusion is diagnosed as being caused by allergies, steroid medication may be prescribed for the patient.\nDr. Huong further recommends that, for patients without upper respiratory tract infections, practicing nasopharyngeal exercises in the form of \"chewing gum\" and \"blowing balloons\" can facilitate Facilitates the opening of the Eustachian tube, thereby increasing the ventilation rate of the middle ear.\n2. Surgical treatment\nSurgical treatment is indicated for cases that have been treated conservatively but without results; suffering from chronic otitis media with effusion, recurring many times and severe hearing loss.\nEndoscopic surgery to treat otitis media - Exclusive photo of Tam Anh General Hospital\nAdenoid curettage surgery\nAdenoid curettage or combined with ventilation tube placement is a common surgery in the treatment of otitis media with effusion. If there is evidence of adenoid hypertrophy or localized infection, adenoid curettage surgery can effectively improve the patient's hearing.\nPlace ventilation tube\nSurgical treatment is the most effective treatment for otitis media with effusion, often indicated for chronic cases that do not respond to conservative treatment. The main function of this method is to ventilate the middle ear, thereby reducing fluid accumulation in the middle ear.\nThe procedure is usually performed in the lower quadrant of the eardrum. If placed properly, the catheter will usually stay in place for about 6-12 months before being expelled naturally. With this treatment method, patients do not need to combine antibiotics.\nDr. Huong warned that placing a ventilation tube can cause some serious complications. Therefore, it requires surgeons to be highly skilled, experienced and preferably equipped with modern technology and machinery to provide optimal results.\nOther procedures and surgeries\nIn cases of otitis media with effusion causing complications, sinus surgery or mastoidectomy may be indicated.\nFirst, otitis media with effusion needs to be treated with medications such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, antihistamine... If the patient does not respond to treatment, surgery may be indicated.\n\nComplications of otitis media with effusion\nAccording to Dr. Huong, otitis media with effusion that is not treated well can easily become chronic. Long-term fluid retention and recurrent infections not only cause many serious complications in adults but also affect development and behavior in children.\nEffects on children:\nDelayed speech and language development; Poor learning; Reading disorder; Difficulty in education; Experiencing behavioral problems\nGeneral effects in both adults and children:\nDeformed eardrum; Osteonecrosis of ossicles; Atrial fibrosis; Cholesterol granuloma, cholesteatoma; Sensorineural hearing loss\n\nPrevention of otitis media with fluid retention\nIn preventing otitis media with effusion, Dr. Huong advises people to:\nKeep ears dry and clean; Avoid letting water, foreign objects, and insects get into your ears; Avoid getting ear, nose, and throat diseases, especially sinusitis, tonsillitis, and adenoiditis; Avoid catching flu and other contagious diseases, which can cause otitis media; When the ear, nose, and throat have unusual symptoms that do not go away for more than a week, you need to go to the hospital for specialized examination, especially in children.\nYou should not remove earwax with hard objects, especially at barbershops because it can increase the risk of infection with pathogens including bacteria, viruses, fungi and the risk of ear damage leading to infection. .(3)\n\nFrequently asked questions about otitis media with effusion\n1. Is otitis media with effusion contagious?\nOtitis media with effusion can be contagious if it is caused by a virus.\n2. What medicine should I take for otitis media with effusion?\nAntibiotics, antihistamines, mucus thinners, and steroids are often used to treat otitis media with effusion. However, patients need to take medication when prescribed and directed by an ENT specialist; You should not buy medicine to use on your own because it can cause adverse side effects to treatment.\n3. Is otitis media with effusion common in adults?\nOtitis media with effusion is more common in children, especially children under 2 years old, than in adults. The disease also affects children more than adults because hearing loss or reduction can easily lead to slow development in both language and cognition.\nOtitis media with effusion is a common disease that affects hearing, especially in 2-year-old children, the most important age for language development. Hearing plays an important role in children's language and cognitive development. Therefore, otitis media with effusion should be considered a serious disease and should be detected early through regular health examinations. At the same time, Dr. Huong also noted that patients need to be treated according to the doctor's regimen to avoid complications affecting physical and mental health.\nDepartment of Otorhinolaryngology, Tam Anh General Hospital examines, diagnoses, and intensively treats ear, nose, and throat diseases, including otitis media with effusion. With a team of skilled and experienced experts and leading doctors, supported by the most modern medical examination and treatment equipment system along with close combination in diagnosis and treatment between specialties.
