    "content": "Laryngitis: Causes, complications and treatments\n\nThe larynx is likened to a \"voice box\" that helps us perform communication states of speaking, singing, whispering or shouting. Laryngitis occurs when the \"voice box\" and vocal cords become inflamed, causing problems such as hoarseness, sore throat, and even a state of \"appearing but losing sound\". So what are the causes, signs, treatments and complications of this condition?\n\nWhat is laryngitis?\nLaryngitis is inflammation of the larynx due to overuse, irritation or infection.\nInside the larynx are the vocal cords – two folds of mucous membrane – that cover muscle and cartilage. Normally, the vocal cords open and close rhythmically, creating sound through their movement and vibration.\nLaryngitis makes the throat easily irritated\n“When the larynx is inflamed, the vocal cords easily fall into a state of irritation. Causes swelling in the vocal cords, distorting sound when air passes through. As a result, the voice becomes changed and weakened. In some cases, people with laryngitis may lose their voice,\" said Dr. Tran Thi Thuy Hang, Head of the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City.\nLaryngitis can be short-term (acute) or long-lasting (chronic). Most cases of laryngitis are caused by a temporary viral infection and are not serious. However, persistent hoarseness is sometimes seen as signaling a more serious underlying medical condition. (first)\n\nCauses of laryngitis\n1. Acute laryngitis\nAcute laryngitis is a temporary health problem. The cause may be due to overuse of the vocal cords or infection. Treating the root cause will help clear laryngitis. Accordingly, acute laryngitis can be caused by:\nViral and bacterial infections; After respiratory infections: rhinosinusitis, tonsillitis, adenoiditis in children; Using a strenuous voice: talking a lot, shouting, singing loudly; Drink too much alcohol\n2. Chronic laryngitis\nChronic laryngitis occurs due to long-term exposure of the larynx to irritants. This condition usually lasts longer than acute laryngitis.\nChronic laryngitis can be due to the following causes:\nFrequent exposure to toxic chemicals or allergens; Acid reflux from the stomach; Frequent sinusitis; Smoking or being around people who smoke; Voice abuse; Fungal infections due to regular use of inhalers to treat asthma; Changes in vocal cord shape due to aging can also cause persistent hoarseness (2)\n\nSymptoms of laryngitis\nLaryngitis often comes suddenly and becomes severe in the first 5-7 days. Common signs are:\nHoarse voice, shortness of breath, weak voice; Occasional loss of voice; An annoying cough that doesn't go away; Frequent need to clear throat; Sore throat, difficulty swallowing\nIn addition, inflammation of the epiglottis (glottitis), an inflammation of the tissue at the base of the tongue, can also occur. The epiglottis is the tissue that covers the larynx and trachea (breathing tube), located at the bottom of the tongue, and is responsible for protecting the airway when swallowing. When epiglottitis occurs, the tissue swells, causing narrowing of the airways, leading to the risk of death if not treated.\nTherefore, go to the doctor immediately if you see your child showing signs of:\nDifficulty swallowing, painful swallowing; Difficulty breathing (needing to lean forward to breathe); Excessive salivation (drooling); When breathing, make a wheezing or hissing sound; The voice seemed muffled; Fever appears\nLaryngitis may also be associated with influenza infection. Therefore, symptoms of viral infection may also appear. (3)\n\nSubjects at risk of laryngitis\nAdults and children are both at risk of laryngitis. At different ages, risk factors will be different. Specifically:\nFor adults:\nPeople who are often exposed to toxic chemicals and allergens; People with stomach acid reflux; People with repeated episodes of rhinosinusitis; People who regularly smoke or are near smokers; People who use their voice too much such as teachers, singers, MCs, businessmen, traders...; People get fungal infections because they often use asthma inhalers\nFor young children:\nChildren often have nasopharyngitis, then laryngitis; Children often scream or sing too much, causing swelling of the vocal cords\n\nDiagnosis of laryngitis\nViral laryngitis usually goes away within a few weeks, and you may not need to see a doctor. However, if the condition lasts longer and there is a risk of affecting the vocal cords and larynx, you need to see a doctor. (4)\nLaryngoscopy technique helps detect signs of laryngitis\nThe doctor may prescribe diagnostic imaging or perform laryngoscopy by inserting a soft, small diameter tube with a tiny camera attached into the mouth or nose to see if there are signs of inflammation. larynx:\nVocal cord edema, congestion, mucus and pus; The vocal folds are too loud and cover the vocal cords during pronunciation; In severe cases, the vocal cords become hyperplastic, round like a rope, and lose their luster; Signs of gastric reflux causing damage to the larynx\nIf a suspicious lesion or lump appears, your doctor may order a biopsy to rule out nasopharyngeal cancer. During a biopsy, your doctor will take a small sample of tissue to test in the lab. Your doctor may also do skin allergy tests or X-rays to rule out other problems.\n\nComplications and transmission routes\nLaryngitis in adults is not serious, but you should see a doctor if you have hoarseness lasting more than 2 weeks, fever, cough, or difficulty breathing.\nFor children, laryngitis can cause serious health problems. Therefore, you need to monitor fever and take your child to the doctor if the following cases occur:\nChildren cry without making a sound or have a very hoarse voice; Difficulty swallowing or breathing, making a wheezing sound when inhaling, or drooling more than usual\nNote, complications of laryngitis in children can cause narrowing of the airways, bronchopneumonia, etc., which can be more dangerous and life-threatening. Therefore, seek emergency treatment if your child has laryngitis and shows signs of panting or difficulty breathing. (5)\n\nTreatment of laryngitis\nThe best way to treat laryngitis is to let this part \"rest\", reduce vocal cord activity, so that the disease gradually improves. If the disease shows no signs of deterioration, you can apply the following methods:\n1. Using medicine\nThe use of medication also requires the advice of a specialist. Medications commonly used to treat laryngitis include:\nCorticosteroids: This is a group of anti-inflammatory drugs that help reduce swelling; Antibiotics: Used when the cause is bacterial; Analgesic. You can use acetaminophen or ibuprofen to relieve pain, but the frequency and amount of use should follow your doctor's instructions.; Throat laryngeal spray.\n2. How to care and treat at home\nSome home treatments to help treat the disease you can apply:\nDrink plenty of water, avoid alcohol and caffeine; Use a humidifier; Rinse mouth with antiseptic solution; Use topical lozenges; Avoid being in dry, smoky or dusty environments; Limit talking too much, talking loudly, talking continuously\n3. Other methods\nVoice therapy: Your therapist will teach you how to care for and reduce excessive activities that damage your vocal cords.\n\nPrevention of laryngitis\nTo prevent laryngitis, you need to follow these prevention rules:\nDo not use hot and spicy foods to avoid aggravating laryngitis\nAvoid smoking and stay away from secondhand smoke; Limit alcohol and caffeine; Drink plenty of water, about 2 liters of water per day; Avoid spicy and sour foods, avoid eating late at night, to avoid gastroesophageal reflux; Use healthy foods: eat lots of fruits, vegetables and whole grains; Avoid clearing your throat, limit talking too much, talking loudly, talking continuously, shouting; Avoid upper respiratory infections: Wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people who are infected with the virus.\nIn addition to ways to prevent laryngitis, to improve the disease, patients need to know what to eat and what to avoid with laryngitis.
