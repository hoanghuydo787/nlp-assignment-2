This is a dangerous disease that can cause many acute complications such as organ failure, infectious necrotizing pancreatitis, sepsis with a high risk of death or chronic complications with long-term health effects such as diabetes. , exocrine dysfunction, pancreatic cancer - said Dr. Huynh Van Trung.\nPancreatitis is very common and is mainly caused by alcohol abuse, gallstones, hyperlipidemia...\n\nWhat is pancreatitis?\nPancreatitis is a condition in which the pancreas becomes inflamed and red due to digestive fluids or enzymes attacking the pancreas.(2)\nThe pancreas is a gland located behind the stomach, on the left side of the abdomen, close to the first part of the small intestine. The pancreas performs two main tasks, which are:\nCreate enzymes to supply the small intestine to break down food; Produces the blood hormones insulin and glucagon to control blood sugar levels.\nPancreatitis is often divided into 2 types:\nAcute pancreatitis: Is a condition in which the pancreas suddenly becomes inflamed and swollen, occurring in a short period of time. The disease can progress to organ failure, sepsis, pancreatic necrosis... if not treated promptly, it can lead to dead. The main causes are gallstones, alcohol abuse, and increased blood fat; Acute pancreatitis: Is a condition in which the pancreas suddenly becomes inflamed and swollen, occurring in a short period of time. The disease can progress to organ failure, sepsis, pancreatic necrosis... if not treated promptly, it can lead to dead. The main causes are gallstones, alcohol abuse, and increased blood fat.\nChronic pancreatitis: A condition in which the pancreas is inflamed for a long time. The main cause of acute pancreatitis is alcohol, which recurs many times. There are often chronic complications such as diabetes, exocrine dysfunction, pancreatic cancer... (3); Chronic pancreatitis: A condition in which the pancreas is inflamed for a long time. The main cause of acute pancreatitis is alcohol, which recurs many times. There are often chronic complications such as diabetes, exocrine dysfunction, pancreatic cancer... (3)\n\nSymptoms of pancreatitis\nMost people with acute or chronic pancreatitis have the following symptoms:\n1. Symptoms of acute pancreatitis\nPain that starts slowly or suddenly in the upper abdomen, may spread to the back; The pain can last several days (1); Fever; Nausea; Vomiting; Distention; Fast heart beat\n2. Symptoms of chronic pancreatitis\nPain in the upper abdomen, often occurring after eating, can spread to the back; Diarrhea; Nausea; Vomiting; Weight loss; Fatty stools\nPancreatitis often has pain that starts slowly or suddenly in the upper abdomen\n\nCause of pancreatitis\nThe most common causes of pancreatitis include:(4)\nGallstone disease (most common); Alcohol abuse (second cause); Blood fat (blood triglycerides) (third common cause); Abdominal trauma or surgery; Calcium content in blood is very high; Use of certain medications such as estrogens, steroids, and thiazide diuretics; Infection, such as mumps, hepatitis A or B, or salmonella; Certain genetic defects; Congenital abnormalities of the pancreas\n\nComplications of pancreatitis\nDr. Trung said that pancreatitis, especially acute pancreatitis, if not treated promptly, can cause serious complications leading to death.\nComplications may include:\nAcute pancreatitis can cause dangerous complications such as: organ failure, infectious necrotizing pancreatitis, and even death; Chronic pancreatitis can lead to: Pancreatic cancer, Malnutrition, Diabetes, exocrine pancreatic dysfunction\n\nMethods of diagnosing pancreatitis\nTo diagnose pancreatitis, the following methods can be applied.\nBlood tests: to help support the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (lipase or amylase), diagnose the cause (blood triglyceride, blood calcium...) or help assess the severity of acute pancreatitis (urea, red blood cell count). demand, CRP..); Blood tests: to help support the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (lipase or amylase), diagnose the cause (blood triglyceride, blood calcium...) or help assess the severity of acute pancreatitis (urea, red blood cell count). demand, CRP..)\nAbdominal X-ray: helps differentiate acute pancreatitis from other surgical diseases such as intestinal obstruction, perforated viscus, etc. in the case of patients with acute abdominal pain admitted to the hospital; Abdominal X-ray: helps differentiate acute pancreatitis from other surgical diseases such as intestinal obstruction, perforated viscus, etc. in the case of patients with acute abdominal pain admitted to the hospital.\nAbdominal ultrasound is the first choice to help suggest a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, diagnose the cause of acute pancreatitis (gallstones) as well as differentially diagnose other intra-abdominal causes of abdominal pain such as appendicitis, cholecystitis…; Abdominal ultrasound is the first choice to help suggest a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, diagnose the cause of acute pancreatitis (gallstones) as well as differentially diagnose other intra-abdominal causes of abdominal pain such as appendicitis, cholecystitis…\nCT scan: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen with contrast is highly accurate in diagnosing acute pancreatitis. Abdominal CT is often recommended in cases where the diagnosis is unclear (on admission) but pancreatitis is suspected or in cases where the patient shows no clinical improvement. In cases where patients are allergic to contrast agents or have kidney failure or are pregnant women, abdominal MRI is an alternative; CT scan: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen with contrast is highly accurate in diagnosing acute pancreatitis. Abdominal CT is often recommended in cases where the diagnosis is unclear (on admission) but pancreatitis is suspected or in cases where the patient shows no clinical improvement. In cases where patients are allergic to contrast agents or have kidney failure or are pregnant women, abdominal MRI is an alternative.\nMagnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS): If the cause of pancreatitis cannot be found, especially in cases where pancreatitis recurs many times, the doctor may use this method. to diagnose disease.; Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS): If the cause of pancreatitis cannot be found, especially in cases where pancreatitis recurs many times, the doctor may use this method. to diagnose disease.\nBlood tests are one of the basic methods to help diagnose pancreatitis\n\nMethods of treating pancreatitis\nThe treatment of pancreatitis will be based on two types of inflammation: acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis.(6)\n1. Treatment of acute pancreatitis\nDr. Trung said that in the management of acute pancreatitis due to any cause, pain relief and fluid replacement are the two most important fundamental principles. Next is to address the cause (if any) such as reducing blood fat (triglycerides), gallstone intervention, trauma... Antibiotic treatment if there is evidence of infection. And especially consider feeding patients early within 24-72 hours after admission depending on the severity of pancreatitis as well as the ability to tolerate food by mouth or through a gastric tube.\n1.1 Pain relief, fluid replacement\nPain relief: Patients receive active pain relief with painkillers; Fluid replacement: Depending on the severity and accompanying pathology, the patient may be given Ringer lactate solution or Sodium chloride 0.9%. Note, patients need to closely monitor urine output, vital signs, and blood tests such as red blood cell volume and blood urea concentration to determine the exact amount of fluid needed, avoiding too much or not enough fluid.\n1.2 Feed early\nDepending on the severity and tolerability, patients with acute pancreatitis are recommended to be fed early within 24-72 hours after admission. If the patient cannot tolerate oral intake, feeding can be done through a nasogastric tube. In cases where early feeding is contraindicated, such as paralytic ileus, intestinal obstruction, etc., intravenous feeding can be used instead.\nDr. Trung said that \"early feeding helps prevent dangerous complications such as multi-organ failure and acute necrotizing pancreatitis, which would not be possible if the patient received enteral feeding too late.\"\n1.3 Antibiotics\nOveruse of antibiotics in acute pancreatitis without evidence of infection sometimes delays fluid resuscitation and treatment of the primary cause in acute pancreatitis emergency. All recommendations for the treatment of acute pancreatitis do not agree on the use of antibiotics for the purpose of preventing infection.\n2. Treatment of chronic pancreatitis\nPatients with chronic pancreatitis often have symptoms and/or complications such as chronic abdominal pain, malnutrition, steatorrhea due to pancreatic enzyme deficiency, diabetes due to endocrine pancreatic enzyme disorders, and even pancreatic cancer.\nTherefore, treatment of chronic pancreatitis focuses mainly on improving symptoms, helping to prevent disease progression as well as promptly detect and treat complications of pancreatic cancer.\nTreat the cause such as stopping alcohol, smoking, gallstones, hypertriglyceridemia... to prevent recurrence of pancreatitis.; Pain relief if patients with chronic pancreatitis have a lot of pain. You can use medicine or endoscopy to remove pancreatic stones, or even surgically intervene with pancreatic stones if necessary to reduce pain.; Supportive treatment of pancreatic enzymes in patients with evidence of exocrine pancreatic enzyme deficiency.; Treat with insulin if the patient has diabetic complications, and periodically monitor to detect pancreatic cancer early.\n\nMethods to prevent pancreatitis\nTo prevent pancreatitis, doctors advise people to:\nLimit drinking alcohol, beer, and tobacco; Eat scientifically and cleanly to avoid parasitic infections; Limit salty foods, fast foods, and fatty foods; If you have diabetes, blood fat, or gallstones, you need to manage your underlying disease well and have regular check-ups to avoid complications that cause pancreatitis.\n\nFrequently asked questions about pancreatitis\n1. Is pancreatitis dangerous?\nPancreatitis can be considered a dangerous disease, especially acute pancreatitis because it can quickly lead to death if not promptly intervened.\n2. Can pancreatitis be cured?\nAcute pancreatitis can be treated completely and the earlier it is treated, the higher the effectiveness, the less expensive it is and the patient can avoid complications that affect their health.\n3. What should you avoid eating with pancreatitis and what should you eat with pancreatitis?\nDr. Trung said that a balanced, low-fat diet plays an important role in recovery from pancreatitis. Therefore, people with chronic pancreatitis especially need to monitor the amount of fat in their daily diet and try to limit or avoid the following foods:\nRed meat; Fried foods; Full-fat milk; Sugary desserts; Soft drink; Caffeine; Alcohol\nBesides, patients should eat many small meals a day to reduce the burden on the digestive system; eat foods rich in protein and antioxidants; Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.\nIn addition, patients can take vitamin supplements to receive the necessary nutrients. However, this requires a doctor's instructions.\n4. Does pancreatitis recur?\nPancreatitis is not difficult to treat, but it is also very easy to relapse. Therefore, it is important that after treatment, patients continue to maintain their doctor's recommendations to avoid recurrence.\nFor advice on the cost of examination and treatment of pancreatitis or other gastrointestinal diseases, please contact: TAM ANH GENERAL HOSPITAL SYSTEM Hanoi: 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Ward.
