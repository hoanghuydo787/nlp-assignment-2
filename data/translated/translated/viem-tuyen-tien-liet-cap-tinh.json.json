    "content": "Acute prostatitis: Causes, symptoms and diagnosis\n\nAcute prostatitis is a medical problem that can occur in adult men of any age but is more common in people under 50 years old. Symptoms of the disease appear suddenly, in many cases causing serious health effects due to not being diagnosed promptly. Therefore, to minimize dangerous complications, patients should proactively follow up and check for early treatment.\n\nWhat is acute prostatitis?\nAcute prostatitis is a condition in which the gland becomes inflamed and suddenly swollen, causing pain, painful urination, frequent urination, difficulty urinating, painful ejaculation, and possibly cloudy fluid or pus in the urethra. In most of these cases, the cause usually comes from a type of bacteria that causes urinary tract infections or sexually transmitted diseases. (first)\nSpecifically, the prostate is a small, walnut-shaped organ that hugs the neck of the male bladder. This gland has the function of secreting fluid to transport sperm during ejaculation. When the prostate is inflamed, the process does not function normally, the patient will encounter many serious problems related to sexual function, urination...\n\nWhat causes acute prostatitis?\nThe most common cause of acute prostatitis is bacteria.(2) Specifically, these include:\nBacteria that cause UTIs that can cause prostatitis include: Proteus, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli.; Some bacteria cause gonorrhea and Chlamydia.\nIn addition, a number of other common medical conditions can also lead to this serious condition, including:\nUrethritis.; Epididymitis.; Phimosis.; Perineal trauma.; Bladder outlet obstruction (may occur due to an enlarged prostate or stones in the bladder).; Damage caused by using a urinary catheter or cystoscopy.\n\nSymptoms of acute prostatitis\nAcute prostatitis often occurs suddenly with serious symptoms as follows:\nUrine has a foul smell; Decreased urine flow.; Burning pain when urinating; Chills.; Fever.; Pelvic pain; Appearance of blood in urine.; Increased frequency of urination; Pain during ejaculation.; Appearance of blood in semen; Difficulty starting urination; Pain in the genitals, rectum or testicles.\n\nWho is at risk of acute prostatitis?\nFactors that increase the risk of urinary tract infections, diseases related to the sexual tract, and urethritis also increase the risk of acute prostatitis. Specifically, people belonging to the following target groups:\nNot drinking enough water; Use a urinary catheter.; Having sex with multiple people; Unprotected vaginal or anal sex; Adult male.; Having a urinary tract infection; Pelvic injury; Suffering from orchitis, HIV/AIDS.; Psychology is always stressful.\n\nAre complications of acute prostatitis dangerous?\nAcute prostatitis, if not detected and treated early, can lead to many dangerous complications, including: (3)\nSepsis.; Epididymitis.; Abscess.; Chronic prostatitis.; Chronic pelvic pain.\n\nMethods of diagnosing acute prostatitis\nFor acute prostatitis, your doctor will initially ask some questions regarding your medical history and conduct a physical examination, to determine the underlying cause. Some diagnostic methods that can then be performed include:\nRectal prostate examination: During this procedure, the doctor will wear gloves and gently insert a lubricated finger into the rectum to feel the prostate located in front. If this area is inflamed due to bacteria, easily recognizable signs are swelling, tenderness, and pain. During the examination, the doctor may also massage the prostate to force a small amount of fluid into the urethra. In addition, the fluid can also be taken for testing to check for signs of infection (stained, examined, or cultured to look for pathogenic bacteria); Blood test: Blood test is done to determine bacteria in the blood (if high fever is present).; Urine sediment analysis: This method will help doctors detect blood, white blood cells or bacteria in urine.; Fresh examination of urethral fluid: This method is performed to identify some types of bacteria, fungi, protozoa... that commonly cause diseases in the genital and urinary organs.; Urodynamic testing: The goal is to identify some problems related to the bladder.; Cystoscopy: The doctor performs a cystoscopy to examine the inside of the urethra and bladder to identify specific lesions that cannot be seen through external examination.\n\nTreatment methods for acute prostatitis\n1. Antibiotics\nYour doctor will likely prescribe antibiotics to treat acute bacterial prostatitis. The course of use usually lasts 4-6 weeks or longer if the condition shows signs of recurrence. In addition, depending on the type of bacteria causing the disease, the doctor will prescribe different medications.\n2. Alpha blockers\nAlpha blockers relax bladder muscles, helping to reduce unpleasant symptoms when urinating. Some commonly used types include: Doxazosin, Terazosin and Tamsulosin. In many cases, your doctor may also prescribe over-the-counter pain relievers, such as Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen.\n3. Adjust daily habits\nUncomfortable inflammation symptoms can be effectively improved when patients change their eating and living habits to be healthier. Some useful solutions can be referred to as:\nAvoid cycling to limit pressure on the prostate.; Avoid drinking alcohol and drinks containing caffeine; Avoid eating spicy, acidic foods; You should sit on a pillow or cushion.; Bathe with warm water.\n\nPreventive measures for acute prostatitis\nAcute prostatitis often occurs suddenly and can lead to many serious complications if not treated early. However, patients can completely proactively prevent it from the beginning with some positive solutions as follows: (4)\n1. Maintain hygiene\nMen need to clean their genitals and surrounding areas every day to prevent the penetration and growth of harmful bacteria. This is a simple solution but brings many positive benefits, helping to minimize the common condition of prostatitis.\n2. Avoid habits that harm the prostate\nCycling or sitting in one place for too long will put pressure on the prostate, over time leading to inflammation. Therefore, here are two habits that need to be changed to minimize this serious condition.\n3. Exercise\nThe habit of exercising at least 3 times a week will help improve physical and mental health, especially reducing stress and balancing emotions. This is also a solution to maintain a healthy prostate, minimizing acute inflammation.\n4. Add enough water to the body\nAcute prostatitis can occur due to bacterial invasion in the urinary tract, causing infection. Therefore, adding enough water every day is really necessary to help the urine excretion process go smoothly.\n5. Eat lots of green vegetables and fruits\nGreen vegetables and fruits are ideal nutritional supplements for the body, helping to effectively fight inflammation and infection. For men, to prevent prostatitis, the daily menu should contain the following foods:\nTomato.; Berries (strawberries, raspberries, blueberries...).; Broccoli.; Green tea.; Pomegranate Juice.; Beans (peanuts, soybeans, lentils...).; Citrus fruits.\n6. Maintain a reasonable weight\nBeing overweight puts pressure on the body, including the prostate, and in the long run can lead to infection. Therefore, exercising and building a healthy diet to maintain a reasonable weight is really necessary.\n7. Manage stress\nMen who are often stressed and anxious will face a higher risk of acute prostatitis. So stress management is really important. Men should practice whole-body relaxation exercises, meditation, yoga... to balance their emotions or contact a doctor immediately if they cannot solve the problem.\n8. Have safe sex\nSexually transmitted infections are also one of the causes of prostatitis. This condition often occurs when not using safe measures during sex (wearing condoms), causing bacteria to move into the urethra, causing infection.\nThe Center for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts in internal medicine and surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
