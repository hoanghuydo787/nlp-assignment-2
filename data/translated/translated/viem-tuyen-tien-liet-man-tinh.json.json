    "content": "Chronic prostatitis: Classification, causes & prevention\n\nChronic prostatitis is a urinary disease in men. Although the disease does not increase the risk of prostate cancer, when the disease progresses to chronicity, there are many other potentially dangerous complications for the patient. The effects of chronic prostatitis will reduce the patient's quality of life if not treated and maintained in urinary health.\n\nWhat is chronic prostatitis?\nChronic prostatitis is an infection in the prostate that causes pelvic pain, reduced reproductive function and other problems that cause disruption in life. (first)\nThe prostate is a small gland located below the bladder and in front of the rectum. This part of the urinary system is only found in men. A healthy prostate will be the size of a chestnut and weigh between 20-30 grams. The main function of the prostate is to produce fluid, called prostatic fluid, which makes up 70% of semen.\nThe prostate is surrounded by connective tissue consisting of smooth muscle fibers and elastic connective tissue. Smooth muscle cells also appear inside the prostate, which has a mechanism to contract and force prostate fluid into the urethra during ejaculation.\nThe prostate is divided into 3 main regions: (2)\nAnterior region: This is the smallest part, accounting for only 10% of the prostate.; Peripheral region: Peripheral region accounts for the majority of the prostate with 70%; Central region: This is the location connecting the prostate with the vas deferens and seminal vesicles\nProstatitis is an inflammation of the prostate gland that causes symptoms such as genital pain, pain in the perineum and low back. The disease can also cause other problems that reduce quality of life such as urinary disorders and sexual dysfunction.\nAs for chronic prostatitis, there are two common clinical forms. One is the manifestation of urination disorders and ejaculation disorders such as (painful urination, frequent urination, urethral burning or pain during ejaculation), urine culture finds the cause of the disease is bacteria.\nThe second is chronic pelvic pain (pain in the lower abdomen, burning sensation in the suprapubic area or pain in the perineal area), urine culture may or may not find bacteria, usually the result of inflammatory episodes. previous acute. Depending on the clinical condition, there will be a suitable treatment regimen. However, chronic prostatitis is difficult to treat completely, especially with prostatitis for chronic pelvic pain syndrome.\nPeople with chronic prostatitis will have symptoms similar to acute prostatitis. Therefore, the treatment regimen for chronic prostatitis is mainly to minimize symptoms and impact on the patient's life. At the same time, relieve psychological stress for patients so that the treatment process can achieve optimal results.\n\nClassification of chronic prostatitis\n1. Due to bacteria\nChronic bacterial prostatitis often results from repeated recurrences of acute prostatitis or prolonged untreated disease.\nAcute prostatitis can be completely treated. However, if the patient does not take good care of their urinary health, allows the disease to recur many times or does not treat the disease for a long time, it will progress to chronic prostatitis.\n2. Chronic pelvic pain syndrome\nChronic pelvic pain syndrome is recognized by persistent pain in the pelvic area. A patient can be diagnosed with chronic pelvic pain if the pelvic pain lasts more than 6 months. However, these pains do not need to appear continuously every day for the disease to be considered chronic. (3)\nChronic pelvic pain causes pain in regular or irregular cycles. History may include episodes of urinary tract infections, painful urination, frequent urination or hematuria.\n\nWhat causes chronic prostatitis?\n1. Chronic prostatitis caused by bacteria\nChronic bacterial prostatitis is caused by the development of acute bacterial prostatitis. (4)\nAfter bacteria enter the human prostate through the genital tract, urethra or changes in the immune system. Bacteria will begin to attack the prostate wall, causing swelling and inflammation. Because symptomatic prostatitis is unlikely to go away on its own.\nThe disease will develop into chronic prostatitis if the patient does not receive timely treatment, prolonging the duration of the disease. In addition, chronic bacterial prostatitis can also be caused by repeated acute illness. Continuous, repeated damage will weaken the prostate's function.\nChronic prostatitis can originate from cystitis, urinary catheter inflammation or infection from other nearby organs.\nCauses of chronic prostatitis include:\nBacterial infections such as E.coli, cholera proteus, mycoplasma fungus, etc. Normally, bacteria will enter the prostate through the urinary tract. This is an organ with many bacteria that are harmful to human health.; Immune system reactions or sudden changes in the immune system can cause infections in humans. From there, it leads to urinary tract infections, prostatitis and chronic prostatitis; Damage caused by surgery, specifically post-operative or endoscopic infection. This is a complication that occurs in patients undergoing surgery or endoscopy, although there are very rare cases of complications after surgery. Infection is the most common complication in the above cases. And urinary tract infection is one of the complications after surgery. This causes reverse infection and chronic prostatitis.\n2. Chronic prostatitis with chronic pelvic pain syndrome\nChronic prostatitis with pelvic pain syndrome is considered a type of prostatitis of unknown cause. Because the direct cause of pelvic pain syndrome has not yet been determined.\nAnd because the cause cannot be identified, chronic prostatitis with pelvic pain syndrome is also more difficult to treat.\nCauses of chronic pelvic pain may be related to the following health conditions:\nPsychological stress; Neurological disorders; Immune disorders; Urinary tract infections; Complications of lower abdominal surgery; Endocrine disorders\n\nSymptoms of chronic prostatitis\nChronic prostatitis is a long-term urinary disease that is difficult to completely treat. Patients will experience symptoms similar to acute prostatitis with greater intensity. Besides, they also have to deal with erectile dysfunction and reduced fertility.\nThese symptoms may appear continuously or in certain cycles. Symptoms of chronic prostatitis include:\nPain in the area between the scrotum and anus; Pain in the lower back, penis, testicles, rectum, or inner thighs; Burning pain when urinating, unusual changes in urination frequency (more or less); Pain during ejaculation; Fever in case the patient has chronic prostatitis caused by bacteria\n\nDiagnosis of chronic prostatitis\nBefore performing an in-depth diagnosis, the doctor will collect information about the clinical symptoms the patient is experiencing as well as his or her health condition. From there, get an overview of the patient's prostatitis condition. If one of the symptoms belongs to chronic prostatitis, the doctor will continue the diagnosis by ordering additional appropriate paraclinical tests. (5)\nSome commonly used methods for diagnosing chronic prostatitis include:\nTransrectal prostate examination: With this method, the doctor will use a finger to insert into the patient's rectum and determine whether the prostate is large or not, hard or soft, more or less painful. , the boundary of the route with its surroundings. The method may cause temporary pain or discomfort to the patient; Doppler ultrasound of the prostate using a 2-plane rectal probe: allows assessment of parenchymal density, calcification, cysts, hypoechoic foci, suspected malignant lesions of the prostate and the condition of the prostate. seminal vesicle condition on both sides; MRI resonance imaging. The purpose of this method is to identify areas of prostatitis based on imaging results. Besides, MRI is also a way for doctors to rule out the possibility of prostate cancer in patients.\nOther tests that the patient may need to perform as prescribed by the doctor to find the cause of the disease include:\nUrine test; Prostate fluid testing; Urine culture to look for pathogenic bacteria; Blood tests (assess inflammation, if any); Immunoassay: total PSA, free PSA, free PSA/total PSA ratio to assess cancer risk or to monitor during prostatitis treatment; Endoscopy of the bladder and urethra\n\nHow to treat chronic prostatitis?\nIn general, chronic prostatitis is very difficult to treat completely. Patients can maintain and improve symptoms by taking medication and combining a suitable diet and lifestyle. And the treatment regimen will depend largely on the cause and type of bacteria the patient has.\n1. Treatment with medication\nFluoroquinolone is a common drug used to treat chronic prostatitis. This is an antibiotic used to inhibit the growth of bacteria. This method is mainly used for people with chronic prostatitis caused by bacteria. The drug regimen usually lasts 12 weeks.\nIn addition, your doctor may also prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs such as NSAIDs and alpha blockers such as Flomax. These two medications are effective in reducing inflammation and certain urinary symptoms.\nFor people with chronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome, doctors will focus on relieving the patient's symptoms. Besides using antibiotics, some medications that can be used include:\nMuscle relaxants; Diuretic; Pain relievers, anti-inflammatory drugs; Anti-anxiety medication\n2. Other methods\nPeople with chronic prostatitis need to combine medication with lifestyle measures such as diet and habits to optimize the process of improving prostate health.\nSome highly effective methods to support the treatment of chronic prostatitis include:\nTake a hot bath or soak the genital area with warm water every day at night before bed.; Limit or stop consuming foods that are spicy or have the potential to increase acid secretion in the body\n\nPrevention of chronic prostatitis\nA highly effective method of preventing chronic prostatitis is to maintain good body hygiene, especially the genitals. Because the common cause of chronic and acute prostatitis is infection. Keeping the body and penis clean will minimize the risk of bacteria entering the body through the urethra.\nFor people who are suffering from or have a history of acute prostatitis, they need to pay more attention and protect their urinary health to limit the recurrence of the disease many times.\nIn addition, medical experts encourage men to regularly drink water and not hold urine to prevent diseases related to the kidneys, bladder, and urinary tract, one of the risk factors for glandular infections. prostate.\nCenter for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology - Urology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts, Internal Medicine and Surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
