    "content": "Prostatitis: Causes, signs and diagnosis\n\nProstatitis does not usually increase the risk of prostate cancer. However, this condition can recur many times, affecting mental health and causing complications of sexual dysfunction, infertility, sepsis...\n\nWhat is prostatitis?\nProstatitis is the medical term used to refer to an infection in the prostate. The prostate is a structure in the genitourinary system, found only in men. This gland is located under the bladder, surrounding the posterior urethra, weighs about 20 grams, has the role of secreting fluid in semen and supporting ejaculation in men. (first)\nThe disease manifests in acute or chronic form. The causative agent may be bacterial or non-bacterial. The usual age for prostatitis is middle-aged men around 50 years old or younger (under 40 years old).\nIf not detected and treated promptly, the disease can cause serious health and mental complications and affect men's fertility.\n\nWhat causes prostatitis?\nAccording to urology experts, Center for Urology and Nephrology, Tam Anh General Hospital, there are many causes of prostatitis.\n1. Microorganisms\nThe urinary tract is one of the organs that contains a lot of bacteria such as E.coli, Proteus, Mycoplasma fungus, Enterobacter... These bacteria can enter the prostate through the urethra, causing acute prostatitis. acute and chronic. Sometimes, bacteria can also travel back up the spermatic duct causing orchitis, epididymitis...\n2. Immune system response\nProstatitis can also be an immune system response to a urinary tract infection.\n3. Damage caused by procedures\nSome cases of prostatitis are not related to a bacterial cause. Patients have inflammation  due to procedures related to the urethra, after prostate biopsy, due to injury or trauma when playing sports, vigorous exercise...\n4. Unknown cause\nSometimes prostatitis has no specific cause.\n\nSigns of prostatitis\nSymptoms of prostatitis vary depending on the condition and cause of inflammation. In general, when prostatitis occurs in men, the patient will have the following signs:\nBurning pain when urinating; Difficulty urinating, dribbling, hesitant urination; Frequent urination, nocturia; Feeling of constantly needing to urinate; Cloudy and/or bloody urine; Abdominal pain, groin pain, lower back pain; Pain in the perineum area such as in the middle of the scrotum and rectum; Pain in the penis and testicles; Pain during ejaculation; Muscle aches, chills, fever\nSymptoms of prostatitis\n\nTypes of prostatitis\nBased on the cause of the disease, experts classify prostatitis into 4 types:\n1.

Chronic non-bacterial prostatitis\nMen with non-bacterial prostatitis are often associated with chronic pelvic pain syndrome, recurrent pelvic pain... The disease has urinary tract symptoms, but is not related to bacterial factors. When tested, no bacteria were found.; People with chronic nonbacterial prostatitis have symptoms similar to chronic bacterial prostatitis. The patient has painful urination, frequent urination, and pus cells in the urine.\n4. Asymptomatic prostatitis\nAnother form of prostatitis has no symptoms. Patients often do not realize they have the disease until they discover it accidentally when examining other diseases.; In this case, patients usually do not need treatment, just pay attention to health care and go to the hospital when symptoms become more obvious.\n\nWho is at risk of prostatitis?\nRisk factors for prostatitis in men recommended by urologists include:\nAge: Young or middle-aged male over 50; History of prostatitis; People who have had urinary tract or genital infections; People with Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS); Catheters to diagnose and treat urinary tract diseases; People who have had a biopsy to diagnose cancer risk; People who drink less water cause less urine to be expelled, causing bacteria to remain; People often become dehydrated due to work characteristics, illness, etc.; People doing jobs often experience shaking and concussion\nAdditional risk factors for prostatitis may include: psychological pressure, people who have had nerve damage in the pelvic area due to surgery or injury from exercise, etc.\nIn addition, people with phimosis or at risk of urinary tract infections are also more susceptible to prostatitis than others.\n\nComplications of prostatitis in men\nAcute or chronic prostatitis can cause many complications (2) related to the patient's physical and mental health such as:\nSepticemia; Epididymitis; Prostate abscess; The infection spreads to nearby areas such as the pelvis and spine; Sexual dysfunction, typically erectile dysfunction; Changes in sperm and semen can cause infertility; Anxiety, depression; Death, in severe cases\nWhen suffering from prostatitis, the patient may or may not have symptoms. However, if you notice the following symptoms, you should immediately go to medical authorities:\nBleeding, especially after sex; Abnormal ejaculation, ejaculation mixed with blood; Severe pain appears in the pelvis and lower back\n\nDiagnostic measures for prostatitis\nA specialist diagnoses prostatitis based on medical history and health status.

Urine test\nUrine analysis looks for bacteria, blood, and other factors that are at risk for prostatitis or are caused by prostatitis.\n2. Urine culture\nUrine culture in the laboratory helps find the type of bacteria that has attacked the prostate and predict the appropriate antibiotic to treat.\n3. Rectal examination\nThis examination is performed by a specialist to evaluate the size, density, and elasticity of the prostate. In some cases, the doctor may aspirate pus from the prostate for culture and antibiotic testing.\n4. Urethral fluid culture\nSimilar to urine culture, urethral fluid culture in the laboratory also helps identify bacterial strains and develop appropriate treatment regimens.\n5. Cystoscopy\nCystoscopy helps doctors examine the lower urinary tract to screen, diagnose, monitor the situation and evaluate treatment results. Or the abscess can be ablated and destroyed if the prostatitis is abscessed.\n6. Transrectal ultrasound\nThis is one of the popular imaging diagnostic methods, helping to determine prostate size, condition of parenchymal tissues, tumors, inflammation... In addition to helping determine the risk of prostatitis, ultrasound can also help determine the risk of prostatitis. can help detect the early signs of cancer in this part.\n7. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nMagnetic resonance imaging allows a comprehensive examination of the prostate, in order to assess the risk of infection for appropriate intervention.; In some cases, the doctor may prescribe the patient to perform urodynamics, blood tests to find prostate-specific antigen (PSA), etc. to serve the diagnosis of prostatitis.\n\nTreatment of prostatitis\nDepending on the cause of prostatitis, patients may be prescribed treatment with the following appropriate methods:\n1. Treatment with medication\nAntibiotics: Antibiotics such as Levofloxacin, Ciprofloxacin... are often prescribed by doctors for patients with prostatitis caused by bacteria. People using antibiotics must strictly follow the treatment regimen to kill bacteria, avoid the risk of relapse and drug-resistant bacteria.; Most of these antibiotics are taken orally, but can also be given by injection to shorten treatment time.; Alpha blockers: This group of drugs helps relax the muscles of the prostate and bladder neck to resolve symptoms of burning, painful urination, frequent urination...; A side effect of alpha blockers is low blood pressure, so doctors will consider using this drug for people with low blood pressure or taking antihypertensive drugs.; Anti-inflammatory and pain relievers: Ibuprofen, Piroxicam, Diclofenac, Paracetamol... help reduce unpleasant symptoms of prostatitis such as pain, fever...\n2.
