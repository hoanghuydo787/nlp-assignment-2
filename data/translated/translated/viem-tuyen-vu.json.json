    "content": "Mastitis: Causes, signs, diagnosis and prevention\n\nMastitis is not dangerous but causes pain and fever, affecting the mother's health while raising the baby. The article below shares the causes, symptoms, diagnosis and prevention of mastitis.\n\nWhat is mastitis?\nMastitis is an inflammation of the mammary tissue that is sometimes associated with infection. This inflammation causes the breasts to become swollen, hot, red and painful, and can sometimes cause fever and chills. [first]\nMastitis most commonly occurs in women who are breastfeeding (lactational mastitis), but can also occur in women who are not breastfeeding and in men.\nMastitis caused by breastfeeding can make you feel tired and exhausted, making it difficult to care for your baby. Sometimes mastitis causes the mother to wean her baby before planned. Continuing to breastfeed even while taking antibiotics for mastitis may be better for both mother and baby.\nMastitis is an inflammation of the mammary tissue that is sometimes associated with infection.\n\nSigns of mastitis\nSigns and symptoms of mastitis can appear suddenly, including [2]:\nThickening of breast tissue or lumps in the breast; Breasts are swollen; Touching the breast feels warm and hot; A red patch of skin, often wedge-shaped; Pain or burning sensation that occurs continuously or while breastfeeding; Fever from 38.5 degrees Celsius\n\nCauses of mastitis in women\nClogged milk ducts. If the breast is not completely empty after feeding, the residual milk clumping can cause one of the milk ducts to become clogged. This blockage further causes milk to stagnate, leading to mastitis. [3]\nDue to bacteria entering the mammary gland. Bacteria from the surface of your skin and your baby's mouth can enter the milk ducts through a crack in the nipple or through the opening of the milk duct. Milk that stagnates in the breast and is not expressed cleanly, creating conditions for bacteria to multiply.\n\nFactors that increase the risk of mastitis\nHave had mastitis before while breastfeeding.; Sore or cracked nipples – mastitis can even develop without a crack in the nipple or skin [4].; Wearing a tight bra or putting pressure on your breasts when using a seat belt (in a car) or when carrying a heavy bag, can restrict milk flow.; Improper care techniques; Too stressed or tired; Poor nutrition.; Smoke.\n\nDoes mastitis increase the risk of breast cancer?\nMastitis does not increase the risk of breast cancer. However, the symptoms of mastitis are similar to those of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). This is a rare and dangerous type of cancer, with a rash on the chest. Like mastitis, one or both breasts may be red and swollen. Inflammatory breast cancer usually does not cause a lump in the breast. [5]\nYour doctor may recommend an ultrasound or mammogram or both. If signs and symptoms persist even after you complete a course of antibiotics, you may need a biopsy to make sure you do not have breast cancer.\n\nHarmful complications can include mastitis\nMastitis that is not adequately treated or is due to a blocked milk duct can cause a collection of pus (abscess) to develop in your mammary gland. Abscesses often require surgical drainage. To avoid this complication, talk to your doctor as soon as you develop signs or symptoms of mastitis. [6]\n\nMethod of diagnosing mastitis\nYour doctor will do a complete physical examination and ask about your signs and symptoms. A breast milk bacterial culture can help your doctor determine the best antibiotic for you, especially if you have a severe infection. [7]\nWhen you have mastitis, your breasts are swollen, hot, red and painful, and sometimes you may have fever and chills.\n\nHow to treat the disease\nTreatment for mastitis may include [8]:\nAntibiotics. If there is an infection, you may need to take a long course of antibiotics. It is important to take the full dose of medication to minimize the possibility of relapse. If mastitis does not go away after taking antibiotics, contact your doctor again.; Analgesic. Your doctor may recommend pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol or others) or ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin IB or others).; You can continue to breastfeed if you have mastitis. Breastfeeding actually helps get rid of infections. Weaning your baby suddenly is likely to worsen your signs and symptoms.; Your doctor may refer you to a lactation consultant for ongoing help and support. Suggestions for adjusting breastfeeding technique may include:; Avoid leaving your breasts full of milk for a long time before breastfeeding.; Try to make sure your baby latches on properly – this can be a bit difficult when your breasts are engorged. Expressing a small amount of milk by hand before breastfeeding may be helpful.; Massage the breasts while breastfeeding or expressing milk, starting from the affected breast area and working your way up to the nipples.; Make sure your breasts have no excess milk after breastfeeding. If you have difficulty expressing part of your breast, apply a warm compress to the breast before breastfeeding or expressing milk.; You should breastfeed your baby on the breast with clogged milk ducts first because at this time, when the baby is hungry, he will suck harder to suck the breast milk, thereby clearing the clogged milk ducts.; Change breastfeeding positions.\nLifestyle and home remedies\nTo relieve your discomfort:\nAvoid leaving your breasts full of milk for too long before breastfeeding; Apply cold compresses or ice packs to your breasts after breastfeeding; Wear a supportive bra; Rest as much as possible\n\nPrecautions\nTo get the best start to breastfeeding for your baby and to avoid complications like mastitis, consider seeing a lactation consultant for advice on proper breastfeeding techniques. . [9]\nBreastfeeding properly helps prevent mastitis.\nYou can reduce your chances of getting mastitis by following these tips:\nSuck all the milk out of your mammary glands every time you finish breastfeeding.; While breastfeeding, let your baby finish drinking one breast before switching to the other breast.; Change the position you use to breastfeed from one feeding to the next.; Make sure the baby is properly latched onto the breast while feeding.; If you smoke, ask your doctor about quitting smoking\n\nWhen to see a doctor ?\nWhen symptoms appear: breast pain, nipple discharge, worsening sensation after 24 hours of taking antibiotics or a few days of self-treatment at home, you should see a doctor. [ten]\n1. What can you prepare?\nWrite down your symptoms, including any that seem unrelated to the reason for your appointment.; Make a list of all the medications, vitamins and supplements you are taking.; Write down important medical information, including other diseases.; Write down important personal information, including any recent changes or stressors in your life.; Write down questions to ask your doctor. Here are suggested questions to ask your doctor: Will my mastitis go away on its own or do I need treatment? What can I do at home to reduce my symptoms? How can my condition affect my baby? If I continue to breastfeed, is the medication my doctor prescribes safe for my baby? How long will I have to take the medicine? What risk factors can cause the infection to recur? How to reduce the risk of recurrence? In addition to the questions you have prepared to ask your doctor, don't hesitate to ask other questions that come up during your appointment.; Will my mastitis go away on its own or do I need treatment?; What can I do at home to relieve my symptoms?; How may my condition affect my baby?; If I continue to breastfeed, is the medicine my doctor prescribes safe for my baby?; How long will I have to take the medicine?; What risk factors can cause the infection to recur? How to reduce the risk of recurrence?; In addition to the questions you've prepared to ask your doctor, don't hesitate to ask other questions that come up during your appointment.\n2. What will the doctor ask?\nYour doctor may ask you some questions. Having your answers ready can help you save time for the things you want to spend more time on. You may be asked:\nHow long have you had the signs and symptoms? Are they in one or both breasts?; How severe is your pain?; In what position do you breastfeed your baby?; Have you ever had mastitis before?\nIn short, mastitis is not the cause of breast cancer but causes pain and exhaustion for breastfeeding mothers. This condition is also easily confused with inflammatory breast cancer. Therefore, when suffering from mastitis, the patient should see a doctor for examination, treatment, and determination of whether it is breast cancer or not.\nThe Department of Breast Surgery masters the most advanced techniques with the support of modern machinery and imaging diagnostic equipment systems such as: Mammomat Inspiration 3D digital mammography (DBT) system; GE Logiq E10S ultrasound machine, with probe that supports breast elastography, microvascular survey and biopsy orientation support under ultrasound; The new generation Magnetom Amira BioMatrix 3-tesla MRI machine... will help detect early and have safe and effective treatment plans for diseases related to the mammary gland.\nIn addition, at Tam Anh General Hospital there is close coordination between specialties such as: Diagnostic Imaging, Laboratory Testing, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Endocrinology, Anesthesiology, Nutrition, Psychology, Physics therapy... helps make treatment planning for patients comprehensive, multi-modal and individualized to shorten time and increase treatment effectiveness.\nTo schedule an appointment for mastitis examination and treatment with leading experts at the Department of Breast Surgery, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nMastitis causes pain and discomfort, but with proper home care, it will go away on its own. When the condition does not improve, even pain, causing fever... you should be examined at a general hospital for proper and effective treatment coordination.
