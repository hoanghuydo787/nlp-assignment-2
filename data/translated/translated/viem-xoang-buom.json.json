    "content": "Sphenoid sinusitis: Causes, symptoms and treatment\n\nSphenoid sinusitis is a rare disease with potentially dangerous complications such as cranial nerve damage, brain abscess, and meningitis. Sphenoid sinusitis accounts for about 2.7-3% of sinus infections. This is a rare disease with no specific symptoms so it is difficult to recognize. Misdiagnosis leads to off-target treatment, causing patients to face many serious, even life-threatening complications. Meningitis, osteomyelitis of the skull base, cranial nerves... are the most dangerous complications of this disease.\n\nWhat is the sphenoid sinus?\nThe sphenoid sinuses are paranasal sinuses located in the skull and facial bones, hollow, filled with air. The sphenoid sinus has many different functions, including:\nHumidifies and warms inhaled air; Increase the resonance of speech; Acts as an elastic zone to protect vital structures in the event of facial trauma.\nThe sets of sinuses on both sides of the nasal cavity include the maxillary, ethmoid, frontal, and sphenoid sinuses.\nA large sinus may exhibit a number of ridges and depressions associated with adjacent structures. These may include the pituitary gland, optic nerve, and internal carotid artery.\nThe sphenoid sinuses are paranasal sinuses, located in the skull and facial bones, hollow and filled with air.\n\nWhat is sphenoid sinusitis?\nSphenoid sinusitis is a group of diseases characterized by mucosal inflammation of one or both sphenoid sinuses. This disease is also known as isolated sphenoid sinusitis (ISS).\nAs a rule, such changes in the sphenoid sinus are often combined with another nasal pathology. From all paranasal sinus pathologies, isolated sphenoid sinusitis occurs in 1-3% of all inflammatory cases.\n\nSymptoms of sphenoid sinusitis\nSymptoms of sphenoid sinusitis are diverse, similar to the symptoms of typical sinus infections. However, the commonly reported symptoms of patients with sphenoid sinusitis are:\n1. Headache\nSphenoid sinusitis often presents with atypical headaches of varying intensity and location. In particular, the patient does not respond to pain medication and the pain gets worse when moving the head.\nHeadaches can be located in the parietal, forehead, temporal, periorbital and occipital regions. The most common are headaches in the retroorbital and occipital areas, accounting for 72%.\nThese different locations are due to the sensory innervation of the sphenoid sinus, which is innervated by the trigeminal nerve and afferent fibers from the sphenopalatine ganglion.\n2. Visual disorders\nLocal visual disturbances such as double vision, progressive unilateral vision loss and reduced visual field on the damaged side. Ophthalmic symptoms are present in approximately 21% of patients with isolated sphenoid sinusitis.\n3. Rhinitis\nNasal manifestations of the disease include postnasal drip and nosebleeds.\n4. Earache\nEar pain, drowsiness, and meningitis-like symptoms may also occur. However, sphenoid sinusitis can be completely asymptomatic until complications appear.(1)\n\nCauses of sphenoid sinusitis\nAcute sphenoid sinusitis is often associated with bacterial infections, such as Haemophilus influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (strep throat). These types of infections often develop as a result of a pre-existing sinus condition, starting from a viral infection, such as the common cold or flu.\nSphenoid sinusitis can also be triggered by allergens or a fungal infection that develops into a sinus infection, spreading into the sphenoidal cavities.\nIf left untreated, the irritated tissues in the sinuses can provide an ideal environment for bacteria to grow.\n\nComplications of sphenoid sinusitis\nWith respect to the skull base, the sphenoid sinus structure is located centrally, at the junction of the anterior and middle cranial fossae, surrounded by important vascular and neural structures.\nAlthough relatively rare, complications of inflammation and infection from sphenoid sinusitis result from the direct spread of the disease to surrounding tissues. Or it results from thrombophlebitis spreading through valveless veins connecting the paranasal sinuses to the orbit, cavernous sinus, and intracranial cavity.\nThe spread of inflammation and/or infection from the sphenoid sinus to the orbit and cavernous sinus causes 5 complications including:\nOrbital cellulitis;; Subdural abscess;; Orbital abscess;; Cavernous sinus thrombosis.\nIn cavernous sinus thrombosis, infected aneurysms account for only about 2-5% of all intracranial aneurysms. Intracranial aneurysms can also be caused by fungal infections, causing “mycotic” or true fungal aneurysms, although the causative agent is usually bacterial.\nIntracranial and vascular complications of sphenoid sinusitis are rare, accounting for less than 1% of cases, but have a high incidence.\nAccording to the International Classification of Diseases, intracranial complications include:\nEpidural abscess;; Brain abscess;; Meningitis;; Cavernous sinusitis, other intracranial venous sinusitis, or osteomyelitis.\nMost intracranial complications are completely reversible with effective treatment. However, the risk of death can still occur in cases of intracranial complications due to bacterial sinusitis.\n\nDiagnosis of sphenoid sinusitis\nWhen patients present with atypical headaches, doctors can conduct laboratory testing to diagnose sphenoid sinusitis to avoid serious complications.\nTechniques commonly performed to diagnose sphenoid sinusitis include:\n1. Nasal endoscopy\nNasal endoscopy is an important diagnostic tool for paranasal sinus diseases. However, findings in patients with isolated sphenoid sinus disease may be unclear.\n2. CT scan\nCT scanning is an important tool in diagnosing patients with suspected sphenoid sinus disease. Often, isolated sphenoid sinus disease is an incidental finding during radiological workup for atypical headaches.\nCT scan diagnoses sphenoid sinusitis. Photo: Tam Anh Hospital\n\nHow to treat sphenoid sinusitis\nIf initial assessment via CT-scan shows complete opacification of the sphenoid bone with clinical manifestations, the patient can be treated medically. The most common medical method of treating sphenoid sinusitis is using saline, antibiotics, and topical corticosteroids. Surgical intervention in cases where medical treatment is ineffective.\n1. Medical treatment\nSphenoid sinusitis is typically treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to fight infection by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is often at the root of the condition. Many patients also use over-the-counter medications, nasal sprays, and decongestants to help relieve symptoms of sphenoid sinusitis, such as headaches, postnasal drip, and sinus pressure.\nSome symptoms of sphenoid sinusitis, such as postnasal drip and sinus congestion, can be treated with a nasal nebulizer. Nasal nebulizers help deliver prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, and saline solutions deep into the sinuses to treat, improve symptoms, and reduce pain and irritation.\nBecause sphenoid sinusitis has the potential to develop serious neurological symptoms and physical complications, it is important to be diagnosed early and begin treatment immediately.\nWhen detected early, most patients with sphenoid sinusitis respond well to treatment. However, if the infection does not improve or becomes severe, it may be necessary to switch to surgical treatment to prevent dangerous complications.\n2. Surgery\nThere are several approaches to treating sphenoid sinusitis. The most popular among them are transnasal endoscopy, transseptal endoscopy and transethmoid endoscopy.(2)\nIn cases of isolated pathology of the sphenoid sinus, the first two methods are considered the most optimal, since this method does not require opening of other sinus structures.\nThere is a rare group of patients with isolated sphenoid sinusitis who have a high rate of recurrence, even when surgical interventions have been successful. For this group of patients, it is necessary to expand the sphenoid bone and remove all fungal tissue, polyps or mucus.\nSurgery to treat sphenoid sinusitis at Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City\n\nHow to prevent sphenoid sinusitis?\nReducing exposure to harmful bacteria, viruses, allergens and other agents that can irritate and inflame the sinus cavities is the best way to prevent sphenoid sinusitis from developing.\nBelow are some measures to help maintain healthy, well-functioning sinuses:\nAvoid exposure to smoke, dust and other airborne irritants;; Practice daily nasal hygiene;; Maintain allergy prevention habits;; Wear a mask when necessary;; See an Ear, Nose and Throat doctor if your sinus disease does not go away after 3-5 days.\nAdditionally, daily sinus irrigation with a nasal nebulizer can help reduce exposure to viruses, bacteria, and risk factors for allergies.\nPatients can use saline solution to clean and remove particles and irritants trapped inside the sinuses. In addition, the moisturizing solution also helps restore the sinuses and provide more comfort.\n\nFrequently asked questions about sphenoid sinusitis\n1. Can sphenoid sinusitis be cured?\nSphenoid sinusitis can be cured with medications or surgery.\nMedical treatment with nasal irrigation, antibiotics and anti-inflammatories. If medical treatment does not respond, the patient will have endoscopic sinus surgery to treat this disease.\n2. Does sphenoid sinusitis recur?\nSphenoid sinusitis is a disease that is not easy to treat and often has a high recurrence rate, even after successful surgery. The more severe the disease is treated, the higher the recurrence rate, especially for patients with complications. Therefore, early treatment with appropriate methods will bring the highest effectiveness.\nBecause of the ease of recurrence, Dr. Hang advises that patients should have follow-up examinations according to the doctor's appointment, then continue to have annual examinations to monitor and prevent recurrence of sphenoid sinusitis.\n3. Is sphenoid sinusitis dangerous?\nSphenoid sinusitis is a benign condition until complications occur. Complications of neuritis and intracranial complications can be life-threatening such as meningitis and skull base bone inflammation.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with experts at the Department of Ear, Nose and Throat, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nSphenoid sinusitis has no specific symptoms so patients can self-identify. However, severe and persistent headaches are the most common symptom. Besides, other symptoms of rhinosinusitis are also common in sphenoid sinusitis. Therefore, Dr. Hang advises that when experiencing nasal and sinus conditions that do not improve for more than 1 week, the patient should see an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist to find the cause and receive timely treatment.",
