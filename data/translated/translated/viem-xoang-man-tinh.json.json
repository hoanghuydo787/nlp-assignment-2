    "content": "Chronic sinusitis: Causes, symptoms and prevention\n\nChronic sinusitis is one of the most common chronic diseases, causing a lot of trouble and ranking 5th among the diseases that use antibiotics the most. There are pairs of sinuses connected to the nasal cavity: ethmoid sinus, sphenoid sinus, frontal sinus and maxillary sinus. These sinuses allow air to be filtered and humidified during inhalation. In order for pathogens to be filtered and eliminated, the fluid in the sinuses needs to be drained. There are many factors that hinder nasal drainage, creating conditions for bacteria to accumulate. Ciliary dysfunction or structural nasal abnormalities can aggravate this process.\nChronic sinusitis is one of the most common chronic diseases and uses antibiotics the 5th most among infectious diseases.\n\nWhat is chronic sinusitis?\nChronic sinusitis is sinusitis or rhinitis that occurs for more than 12 weeks. Chronic sinusitis can manifest as chronic sinusitis without nasal polyps, chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps, and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis.\n\nSymptoms of chronic sinusitis\nMSc.BSc.CKI Nguyen Thi Huong, Department of Ear, Nose and Throat, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, said that people with chronic sinusitis often have main symptoms of sinusitis including:\nCloudy nasal discharge: Green or yellow nasal discharge; Maxillofacial pain: Aches or pain in the maxillofacial area like pressure; Nasal congestion: It may be difficult to breathe on one or both sides of the nose, causing the patient to have to breathe through their mouth.\nIn addition, signs of chronic sinusitis may also include: (1)\nDecreased sense of smell, headache, earache, bad breath, cough or fatigue.; Fever has only a 50% sensitivity but is an important factor determining the severity of sinusitis.; Symptoms occurring for more than 12 weeks do not resolve; Recurrent sinusitis is defined as having at least 4 episodes of sinusitis within a year.\n\nCauses of chronic sinusitis\nViruses and bacteria are the most common causes of sinusitis. Among them, Streptococcus, pneumococcus, Hemophilus and Moraxella are the most common bacteria.\nChronic sinusitis has many triggering factors and may include factors such as infection, inflammation, or sinus structural abnormalities. Other causes such as allergic rhinitis (dust, mold), exposure (irritants in the air, cigarette smoke or other toxins), structural abnormalities (nasal polyps, deviated nasal septum), Immunodeficiency and fungal infections may also be considered.(2)\nOtitis media, asthma, AIDS are other medical conditions that may be associated with chronic rhinosinusitis.\nStreptococcus is the most common known cause of sinusitis.\n\nComplications of chronic sinusitis\nChronic sinusitis may be a benign disease, but has a large morbidity rate. If left untreated, quality of life will be affected.\nThis pathology can worsen asthma and can even lead to meningitis and brain abscess formation, increasing morbidity and mortality.\nIn rare cases, chronic sinusitis can cause complications of orbital infection, leading to vision and optic nerve impairment.\n\nDiagnosis method of chronic sinusitis\nChronic sinusitis is diagnosed when at least two of the following four symptoms are present and occur for more than 12 weeks: including cloudy nasal discharge, facial pain, nasal congestion, and decreased sense of smell.\nChronic sinusitis is less common than acute sinusitis. Acute sinusitis can last up to 4 weeks. However, chronic sinusitis lasts 12 weeks or longer. Therefore, other causes also need to be investigated such as gastroesophageal reflux, anatomical variations or structural problems of the nasal cavity. History of immunodeficiency and history of fungal infections are also factors to be considered next.\nIn diagnosing chronic sinusitis, paraclinical tests are often ordered including.\nCT scan or nasal endoscopy: To determine the presence of inflammation. CT is more sensitive but also more expensive than nasal endoscopy. Nasal endoscopy has lower sensitivity and is not of sufficient use in identifying chronic sinusitis.; Bacterial cultures: May be useful during treatment, assisting in providing appropriate antibiotic therapy. If culture fluid is taken, the doctor will perform it through endoscopy to get the most accurate results.\n\nTreatment of chronic sinusitis\nAccording to Dr. Nguyen Thi Huong, sinusitis treatment will focus on adjusting trigger factors, reducing the inflammatory process and eliminating infection. Depending on the patient's condition, the doctor will prescribe medical or surgical treatment.\n1. Medical treatment of chronic sinusitis without nasal polyps\nReduce triggers: Allergy tests can help identify triggers that patients should avoid.; Steroid nasal spray: Should be used with or without saline nasal irrigation. Treatment should only last at least 8-12 weeks according to your doctor's instructions.; Rinsing the nose with saline: Although it is inferior to nasal steroid spray, however, rinsing the nose with saline can help support treatment. Nasal rinsing with large volumes of saline is said to be more effective than nasal sprays.; Antihistamines: Your doctor may prescribe antihistamines if allergic rhinitis is suspected.; Decongestants: May be used for symptom relief.; Antibiotics: Can be used for an appropriate period of time. Oral anti-inflammatory drugs: Can be used, but should not be used regularly.\nNasal corticosteroids should only be used for 8-12 weeks according to your doctor's instructions.\n2. Medical treatment of chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps\nNasal sprays: Chronic sinusitis with polyps is treated with nasal sprays containing corticosteroids.; Oral anti-inflammatory drugs: If severe or unresponsive to treatment after 12 weeks, your doctor may consider a short course of oral steroids.; Leukotriene antagonists: May be considered for treatment.(4)\n3. Surgical treatment\nEndoscopic sinus surgery may be considered for patients who do not respond to medical treatment.\nThe goal of this surgery is to remove abnormal structures, restore drainage and mucus clearance, and widen and clear the sinus openings.\nIf the patient has underlying diseases such as immunodeficiency diseases, diabetes, etc., treatment of the underlying disease is given priority first.(3)\nEndoscopic sinus surgery helps treat chronic sinusitis effectively at Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City\n4. Supports treatment of chronic sinusitis at home\nIn addition to treatment prescribed by the doctor, patients can use measures to help improve sinusitis symptoms at home such as:\nEssential oil steaming: Essential oil steaming therapy is useful for sinusitis patients. However, for patients with sinusitis caused by allergic rhinitis, caution should be exercised when using the therapy. When steaming essential oils, you also need to pay attention to cleaning and changing the water every day to avoid the risk of infection and mold.; Warm compresses: Warm compresses help reduce sinus pain, clear the airways and help dissolve mucus, making it easier to drain.; Yoga: Some yoga therapies are also helpful in supporting the treatment of chronic sinusitis. Bhramari pranayama is a breathing exercise that has been proven effective in supporting the treatment of sinusitis, and patients can apply it.\n\nHow to prevent chronic sinusitis\nTo prevent chronic sinusitis, you need to proactively prevent the etiological factors that lead to this disease, such as:\nAvoid getting sinusitis or avoid letting sinusitis last for a long time.; Avoid being infected with viruses and bacteria such as Streptococcus, pneumococcus, Hemophilus and Moraxella.; Avoid prolonged flu infection.; Always wear a mask and keep your body warm when leaving the house.; Avoid contact with allergens such as dust, pollen, animal hair and feces.; Avoid eating foods suspected of causing allergies such as seafood, larvae, some nuts, etc.\n\nFrequently asked questions about chronic sinusitis\n1. Is chronic sinusitis dangerous?\nChronic sinusitis is a benign disease, but its complications can become serious, sometimes life-threatening, if not treated promptly. Complications of orbital and intracranial infection can lead to blindness, or death in rare cases.\n2. Can chronic sinusitis be cured?\nPatients with chronic sinusitis who receive treatment often have positive results. Symptom relief can be achieved after functional endoscopic sinus surgery in approximately 75% of patients who do not respond to medical therapy.\n3. Is sinusitis a chronic disease?\nSinusitis is a chronic disease that lasts more than 12 weeks and does not go away with specific symptoms as mentioned above.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with experts at the Department of Ear, Nose and Throat, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nThe sooner chronic sinusitis is treated, the more effective it is, the lower the treatment cost and vice versa. Therefore, as soon as there are symptoms suspected of chronic sinusitis, patients should see an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist for timely diagnosis and treatment, avoiding dangerous complications.",
