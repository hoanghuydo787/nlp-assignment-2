    "content": "Gastric antrum congestion: Causes, symptoms and prevention\n\nGastric antrum congestion is one of the common digestive problems in people who do not pay attention to eating, are stressed or have poor hygiene, leading to HP infection.\n\nWhat is gastric antral congestion?\nThe mucosa is a mucous membrane that protects the stomach from stomach acid. When certain factors damage or weaken this protective layer, the mucosa will become inflamed. Gastric antral congestion is a term that refers to a condition in which the lining of the gastric antral area becomes infected and the blood vessels become congested (dilated blood vessels).\nThe disease is closely related to stomach pain; If not treated promptly, it can lead to complications. The disease can occur suddenly (acute) or last long (chronic).\nCongestive inflammation of the gastric antrum can cause blood vessels in the antral area to bleed\n\nCauses of gastric antral congestion\nThere are many causes of irritation leading to gastric antrum congestion. The disease can originate from one of the following reasons:\nHelicobacter pylori (HP) infection: HP bacteria is a type of bacteria that lives in the mucus layer on the surface of the stomach mucosa. Many people are infected with HP but do not know it because this infection usually does not cause many symptoms. Stomach infections caused by HP bacteria often occur at a young age in areas with high rates of HP infection.(5); Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection: HP bacteria is a type of bacteria that lives in the mucus layer on the surface of the stomach mucosa. Many people are infected with HP but do not know it because this infection usually does not cause many symptoms. Stomach infections caused by HP bacteria often occur at a young age in areas with high rates of HP infection.(5)\nMedication use: If you regularly use medications such as aspirin, ibuprofen or other pain relievers classified as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), etc., you are also at risk of experiencing stomach problems. thickening, including antral congestion; Medication use: If you regularly use medications such as aspirin, ibuprofen or other pain relievers classified as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), etc., you are also at risk of experiencing stomach problems. thickening, including antral congestion.\nDrinking a lot of alcohol and stimulants: Alcoholic drinks and stimulants when used for a long time or used too much at once will cause significant harm to the stomach. Alcohol causes the stomach to secrete more acid than usual, which can gradually \"erode\" the stomach lining and cause inflammation.; Drinking a lot of alcohol and stimulants: Alcoholic drinks and stimulants when used for a long time or used too much at once will cause significant harm to the stomach. Alcohol causes the stomach to secrete more acid than usual, which can gradually \"erode\" the stomach lining and cause inflammation.\nOther causes: Some less common causes but also at risk of causing antral congestion include bile reflux, old age, smoking, cancer treatment, autoimmune gastritis (the body attacks the stomach lining cells), other medical conditions (such as HIV/AIDS, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, sarcoidosis and parasitic infections, etc.)(2); Other causes: Some less common causes but also at risk of causing antral congestion include bile reflux, old age, smoking, cancer treatment, autoimmune gastritis (the body attacks the stomach lining cells), other medical conditions (such as HIV/AIDS, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, sarcoidosis and parasitic infections, etc.)(2)\n\nSymptoms of antrum congestion\nThe majority of patients are asymptomatic. If you experience one or more of the following symptoms, there is a high possibility that you are having symptoms of antral congestion.\nBurning pain in the epigastric area: When there are stomach problems such as gastric antrum congestion, burning pain and discomfort in the epigastric area are quite common symptoms. Epigastric pain can appear in single episodes or last a long time.; Burning pain in the epigastric area: When there are stomach problems such as gastric antrum congestion, burning pain and discomfort in the epigastric area are quite common symptoms.

Patients will often have a burning or gnawing feeling in the stomach between meals or at night.; Heartburn: Many people often ignore this sign. Patients will often have a burning or gnawing feeling in the stomach between meals or at night.\nNausea: There are many diseases with symptoms of nausea, including antral congestion. When the lining of the stomach antrum is inflamed, it will hinder digestion and food breakdown. This causes people with stomach problems to feel nausea, vomiting and reflux.; Nausea: There are many diseases with symptoms of nausea, including antral congestion. When the lining of the stomach antrum is inflamed, it will hinder digestion and food breakdown. This causes people with stomach problems to experience nausea, vomiting and reflux.\nBurning pain in the epigastric area is a common sign of stomach-related problems\nIn some cases, symptoms such as indigestion and stomach upset last only a short time and do not require medical attention. However, you need to see a doctor as soon as possible if these symptoms recur and last for a week or more. If you have severe stomach pain, vomiting blood, or your body feels dizzy/severely dizzy, you need to go to the hospital immediately.\n\nIs antral congestion dangerous?\nAnswer: most cases are not dangerous. Congestive inflammation of the gastric antrum in some cases can lead to consequences.\nComplications of gastric antral congestion\nHemorrhage: Congestion causes blood vessels to rupture, leading to gastric hemorrhage - gastrointestinal bleeding. When bleeding like that, the patient will have black stools or vomit blood. This is a dangerous complication that can threaten the patient's life.; Hemorrhage: Congestion causes blood vessels to rupture, leading to gastric hemorrhage - gastrointestinal bleeding. When bleeding like that, the patient will have black stools or vomit blood. This is a dangerous complication that can threaten the patient's life.\nCases of congestive inflammation caused by HP bacteria become chronic over time, leading to atrophic gastric mucosal inflammation, dysplastic intestinal metaplasia and stomach cancer. However, not everyone with gastric congestion necessarily leads to stomach cancer; Cases of congestive inflammation caused by HP bacteria become chronic over time, leading to atrophic gastric mucosal inflammation, dysplastic intestinal metaplasia and stomach cancer. However, not everyone with gastric congestion necessarily leads to stomach cancer\n\nHow to treat gastric antral congestion\nAfter diagnosing and confirming that you have gastric antral congestion (through symptom examination, family history, digestive endoscopy, etc.), the doctor will advise on treatment.(1 )\nTreatment of gastric antrum congestion depends on the specific cause of the disease. For example, for acute cases caused by taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or abusing alcohol, to help the disease get better, the patient needs to reduce or stop using drugs/alcohol.\nSome medications used to treat gastric antral congestion may be:\nAntibiotics kill HP bacteria: only treat HP when prescribed, by a doctor.; Antibiotics kill HP bacteria: only treat HP when prescribed, performed by a doctor.\nMedications that block acid production: histamine (H-2) blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and acid reducers work by stopping the activity of cells that make acid. These medications may be prescription or over-the-counter medications.; Medications that block acid production: histamine (H-2) blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and acid reducers work by stopping the activity of cells that make acid.

Compared to drugs that block acid production, they are not as effective, but have a quick pain relief effect. The drug is usually taken about 2 hours after eating to help neutralize the excess of acid after it has been neutralized with food.; Acid neutralizers: Helps relieve stomach pain.

You can reduce stress through regular exercise, meditation or yoga.\n\nPrevention of antral inflammation and gastric congestion\nGastric antral congestive gastritis can occur in many subjects.
