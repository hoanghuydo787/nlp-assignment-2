Of these, about 15% of people with ruptured brain aneurysms die before reaching the hospital. Most deaths are due to brain damage due to rapid and massive brain hemorrhage.\n Is a ruptured blood vessel in the brain dangerous?\n? The answer is yes\".\nCerebral aneurysm rupture\n Can lead to dangerous complications, even death, if not treated promptly. The following article will help you better understand these\nsigns of ruptured cerebral blood vessels\n,\nCauses of rupture of blood vessels in the brain\n as well as the way\nTreatment of cerebral vascular rupture\nto have the right prevention and intervention direction, proactively protect health and life.\n\nWhat is cerebral vascular rupture?\nPairs of carotid and vertebral arteries carry blood, oxygen and nutrients to the brain to feed brain cells. Every minute, about 600-700 ml of blood flows through the carotid arteries and their branches to the brain, while about 100-200 ml of blood flows through the vertebral artery system.\nWhen the cerebral blood vessels are damaged, there is atherosclerosis, trauma, or microscopic damage to the arterial wall, abnormal flow appears at the division of the arteries, etc. The blood will form an aneurysm - that is, an abnormally enlarged area on the brain's blood vessels (like thinned rubber on the wall of a car intestine).\nThese aneurysms are at risk of rupture at any time (the risk of rupture is high or low depending on the pressure on the aneurysm and their location in the brain), and leads to cerebral aneurysm rupture. At this time, blood flow will stimulate brain activity, causing increased intracranial pressure. (first)\nNot only that, when a patient has a ruptured blood vessel in the brain, blood begins to spread and irritate the meninges, releasing harmful products and damaging brain cells. At the same time, there will be a vasoconstriction reflex at the rupture site, (spasm) causing ischemia in the brain area behind the rupture, leading to cerebral infarction. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is life-threatening with a 40% risk of death.\nRupture of blood vessels in the brain causes brain cells to die en masse\nPatients with ruptured blood vessels in the brain can lose consciousness, brain cells and brain tissue die en masse, leading to paralysis of limbs, speech disorders, disability, vegetative life... even can cause death.\nSome statistics show that women and especially those over 55 years old are 1.5 times more likely to have a ruptured cerebral blood vessel than men.\n\nSigns of ruptured cerebral blood vessels\nTo identify a patient with a ruptured cerebral aneurysm, you can rely on the following signs: (2)\nThe headache appears suddenly and is severe, and does not improve despite the use of painkillers; Convulsions of limbs appear; Weakness in all four limbs, even paralysis of half the body; Numbness of limbs; Stiff neck and nape; Nausea, vomiting; Decreased vision, eyes more sensitive to light, blurred vision or double vision; Difficulty speaking, language disorders; Difficulty swallowing; Lightheadedness, dizziness and loss of balance; Loss of consciousness, confusion, coma; Dead\nThe symptoms of a cerebral blood vessel rupture are almost similar to the symptoms of a patient having a stroke because a cerebral blood vessel rupture is one of the causes of stroke.\nPeople with a ruptured brain aneurysm may have sudden and severe headaches\n\nCauses of rupture of blood vessels in the brain\nAneurysms in arteries and blood vessels become thin, weakened, enlarge and burst, leading to cerebral blood vessel rupture. Previously, it was thought that ruptured cerebral aneurysms were hereditary. However, today, based on clinical cases and previously conducted research, it can be seen that aneurysm rupture occurs due to the impact of a number of factors such as: (3)\nHypertension: High blood pressure, especially when it increases suddenly, will affect the aneurysm sacs, causing them to burst. People who eat a lot of salt, have dyslipidemia, are often stressed and anxious, stay up late, don't get enough sleep, etc. are often at higher risk of ruptured brain aneurysms.; Due to cerebral aneurysm: In case of cerebral aneurysm, the aneurysm sac becomes larger, thinner, weaker, has poor elasticity and pressure resistance, so it bursts on its own, leading to rupture of the cerebral blood vessel, threatening the patient's life.; Congenital vascular malformations: Rupture of cerebral blood vessels may appear in children with congenital cerebral vascular malformations, which have abnormalities at the connection sites between cerebral veins and arteries.; Due to vascular disease: Patients using anticoagulants, drugs to treat brain tumors, etc. or other vascular diseases may be at higher risk of cerebral blood vessel rupture. In addition, people with a history of cerebrovascular amyloidosis or cerebral hemorrhage are also more susceptible to cerebral vascular rupture.; Other causes: Besides the above causes, there are many other factors that can increase the risk of cerebral vascular rupture including unhealthy eating habits, use of stimulants, and abnormal changes in blood vessels. weather,â€¦\n\nIs a ruptured blood vessel in the brain dangerous?\nAccording to the Brain Aneurysm Foundation (American Brain Aneurysm Association), about 50% of brain aneurysm ruptures are fatal. Those who survived also encountered serious complications. Of these, 66% of people who lived through a critical brain aneurysm rupture suffered permanent nervous system damage. (4)\nComplications that patients with ruptured blood vessels in the brain may face include:\nLoss of language, slurred speech, difficulty in communication; Paralysis of arms, legs or all four limbs, paralysis of half the body; Muscle stiffness, difficulty moving arms and legs; Loss of mobility; Swallowing disorders; Collapsed lung, pneumonia; Urinary tract infections; Anxiety, excessive stress, depression...; Severe cases will lead to death or vegetative state\nRupture of blood vessels in the brain leaves serious complications for the patient\n\nHow to diagnose cerebral vascular rupture\nTo diagnose ruptured cerebral aneurysm as well as prognosis, it is necessary to rely on the patient's health status, clinical signs, location of the sac, bleeding condition, etc. Through this, the doctor can know Whether treatment is still possible and if treatment is possible, appropriate treatment for cerebral vascular rupture should be chosen.\nClinical examination\nTo be able to diagnose a ruptured cerebral aneurysm, the doctor will rely on the patient's medical history as well as the onset of clinical symptoms to diagnose the possibility of the patient having a ruptured cerebral aneurysm.\nThe doctor can conduct an examination and evaluate the symptoms to see if the patient has a distorted mouth, slurred speech, weak limbs, impaired vision, severe headaches, etc. In addition, the doctor will also perform an examination and ask about the medical history of the person brought into the emergency room as well as the medications the patient is using, family medical history, etc.\nLaboratory and diagnostic imaging measures\nImaging diagnosis is a highly applicable and effective method in diagnosing cases of ruptured cerebral blood vessels. Accordingly, patients may be prescribed computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebral angiography (CTA), DSA or lumbar puncture, blood tests, etc. (5)\nCT scan: This non-invasive imaging technique helps quickly detect hematomas in the brain parenchyma or meningeal cavities. Thanks to that, the doctor can evaluate whether the patient has a ruptured brain aneurysm or not. In addition, brain CT scan results also help evaluate anatomical structures inside the brain to find appropriate treatment for patients with ruptured cerebral blood vessels. Tam Anh General Hospital system owns the most modern 768-slice CT machine, actively supporting this diagnosis.; CTA: Cerebral angiography is a diagnostic method that helps detect ruptured blood vessels or evaluate atherosclerosis.; MRI scan: MRI scan can examine the brain parenchyma in detail and evaluate the condition of blood vessels in the brain to know whether the patient has a ruptured blood vessel in the brain or not, as well as the severity of the disease. Currently, Tam Anh General Hospital System owns a 3 Tesla MRI machine which is the newest and most modern generation, actively supporting this diagnosis.; Lumbar puncture: A lumbar puncture will show whether the cerebrospinal fluid is mixed with blood or not, thereby considering the possibility of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm or meningeal hemorrhage.\nLumbar puncture helps detect whether cerebrospinal fluid is mixed with blood or not\n\nHow to treat ruptured blood vessels in the brain\nRupture of a cerebral aneurysm is a neurological disease with a high risk of death. Therefore, the earlier the prognosis and emergency treatment, the more complications and mortality due to damaged brain cells will be minimized, helping to improve the effectiveness of treatment and increase the possibility of recovery.\nThe goal of treating a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is to repair the broken blood vessel and the resulting bleeding to save the patient's life and prevent and minimize possible complications. Currently, the two main methods for emergency treatment of patients with ruptured cerebral blood vessels are endovascular intervention and microsurgery. In addition, medical treatment is also needed in cases of cerebral vascular rupture to help patients stabilize their health condition, treat complications and minimize long-term complications.\nDrug treatment\nDrug treatment is often combined before and after surgical methods or endovascular intervention. The patient will be given painkillers to reduce headache symptoms caused by a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.\nIn addition, to limit serious bleeding as well as help control intracranial pressure, the doctor will give the patient medication to control blood pressure before performing surgery. If the patient has a history of epilepsy or is at risk of seizures, antiepileptic drugs may be needed.\nSurgery\nIn cases of ruptured blood vessels in the brain, surgery is needed as soon as possible. The best time is 24 hours before the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm and at the latest within 72 hours. The doctor will rely on the current state of cerebral vascular rupture and cerebral hemorrhage, the patient's age, health condition prognosis and recovery ability to prescribe the appropriate surgical method.\nSurgical methods to treat cerebral vascular rupture include:\nCraniotomy: This technique is performed by cutting the skull bone to create a small hole in the skull. Using a microsurgical microscope, determine the location of the broken blood vessel and use a titanium clip attached to the neck of the aneurysm, removing the aneurysm from the blood flow, helping the blood no longer flow into the aneurysm but can circulate in the aneurysm. normal vascular lumen. The titanium clip is fixed in the patient's brain for life and cannot be removed.\nIn particular, the most modern brain surgery technique today is the Modus V Synaptive robot application. Licensed for the first time in Vietnam, Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City owns this most modern brain surgery robot, combined with nerve bundle MRI (DTI) technique, allowing doctors to see See images of nerve conduction bundles that correlate with the brain area that is hemorrhaging or damaged. Accordingly, from the simulated surgery using the Robot, the surgeon will avoid damaging nerve conduction bundles during surgery, preserve nerve fiber bundles and healthy brain tissue, and avoid neurological complications. during and after surgery.\nCerebral artery bypass: With cerebral artery bypass, the doctor takes a small vessel in the patient's body (usually from the lower leg or temporal artery) to bypass the ruptured artery, from That creates a new path for blood. A craniotomy to completely block the flow of the artery and the aneurysm and then a cerebral artery bypass will be performed in cases where the ruptured artery is severely damaged or the aneurysm is large and inaccessible.\nCerebral vascular intervention\nPatients with ruptured blood vessels in the brain can receive vascular intervention by:\nCoil button: The doctor will insert the catheter into the artery in the groin and into the blood vessels in the brain to the location of the broken blood vessel. Through it, platinum coils will be inserted to fill the aneurysm. As the aneurysm fills, the flow will gradually decrease and a blood clot will appear and seal the aneurysm.; Placing a cerebral vascular stent: Another technique for treating ruptured cerebral blood vessels is placing a stent in the blood vessel, creating a shelf in the vessel, occluding the aneurysm, and adjusting the flow in the cerebral vessel.\nIn addition, the doctor may give the patient injections of drugs that relax constricted blood vessels to prevent vasospasm. The rate of patients with vasospasm after cerebral vascular rupture is up to 70%. Therefore, to limit the patient's drowsiness, confusion, weakness, etc. when suffering from blood vessel spasm, the doctor will proactively inject blood vessel dilators early.\nDepending on the patient's health condition, the location of the ruptured blood vessel, the size of the ruptured aneurysm and the conditions of the medical facility, the doctor may consider choosing an appropriate treatment method for ruptured cerebral blood vessels. Treatment time depends on the patient's ability to recover, but usually, for the first 10 to 14 days, the patient will have to stay in the intensive care room so that the doctor can closely monitor symptoms and take action. promptly intervene if any abnormalities occur.\nSee more:Â What is cerebrovascular intervention? What diseases are treated?\nDepending on the case, the doctor will consider choosing an appropriate method of intervention for cerebral vascular rupture\n\nHow to prevent cerebral vascular rupture\nTo prevent rupture of blood vessels in the brain leading to stroke, preventive measures can be taken such as:\nExercise regularly, at least 2-3 times/week for at least 30 minutes each time; Maintain a healthy diet, limit salty foods, foods containing saturated fat and cholesterol. Eat lots of vegetables and fruits.; Do not smoke, limit alcohol consumption; Maintain blood pressure at a stable level; Get reasonable rest, get enough sleep 7-8 hours a day, avoid excessive stress.; Proactively examine and screen for neurological diseases.\n\nFrequently asked questions when a brain aneurysm ruptures\nCan a ruptured blood vessel in the brain be saved (or cured)?\nIf patients with a ruptured cerebral aneurysm receive timely emergency treatment and have appropriate treatment methods, they can minimize complications and increase the likelihood of successful treatment. Therefore, cases of cerebral vascular rupture should be taken to emergency intervention as soon as possible.\nHow long can you live with a ruptured blood vessel in your brain?\nHow long a patient with a ruptured cerebral aneurysm can live depends on whether the patient receives timely emergency treatment, the severity of the brain damage, the patient's physical condition, nutrition, and the patient's condition. Whether the disease is properly cared for or not,...\nAccordingly, if the patient receives emergency treatment during the golden time, the chance of survival and recovery will be higher. In addition, patients with mild brain damage have a longer survival time.\nIn particular, an important factor for patients to prolong their life is to maintain optimism and actively coordinate treatment.\nHow long does it take to recover from a ruptured blood vessel in the brain?\nRecovery time for a patient with a ruptured cerebral blood vessel also depends on the level of brain damage, the time it takes to receive emergency treatment, and whether the patient is treated with appropriate methods.\nAfter treatment, a person with a ruptured blood vessel in the brain can take from 3 months to several years to recover their health and completely treat possible complications.\nWhen to see a doctor?\nAs soon as the first signs of a cerebral blood vessel rupture appear, the patient should see a doctor for examination, diagnosis to determine health status and timely treatment and intervention.\nTo schedule an examination and consultation on health issues at Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nRupture of a blood vessel in the brain is a life-threatening condition. You should not be subjective but need to proactively screen periodically, take preventive measures as well as go to the hospital as soon as the first signs appear.",

            "subsection_string": "How to treat ruptured blood vessels in the brain\nRupture of a cerebral aneurysm is a neurological disease with a high risk of death. Therefore, the earlier the prognosis and emergency treatment, the more complications and mortality due to damaged brain cells will be minimized, helping to improve the effectiveness of treatment and increase the possibility of recovery.\nThe goal of treating a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is to repair the broken blood vessel and the resulting bleeding to save the patient's life and prevent and minimize possible complications. Currently, the two main methods for emergency treatment of patients with ruptured cerebral blood vessels are endovascular intervention and microsurgery. In addition, medical treatment is also needed in cases of cerebral vascular rupture to help patients stabilize their health condition, treat complications and minimize long-term complications.\nDrug treatment\nDrug treatment is often combined before and after surgical methods or endovascular intervention. The patient will be given painkillers to reduce headache symptoms caused by a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.\nIn addition, to limit serious bleeding as well as help control intracranial pressure, the doctor will give the patient medication to control blood pressure before performing surgery. If the patient has a history of epilepsy or is at risk of seizures, antiepileptic drugs may be needed.\nSurgery\nIn cases of ruptured blood vessels in the brain, surgery is needed as soon as possible. The best time is 24 hours before the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm and at the latest within 72 hours. The doctor will rely on the current state of cerebral vascular rupture and cerebral hemorrhage, the patient's age, health condition prognosis and recovery ability to prescribe the appropriate surgical method.\nSurgical methods to treat cerebral vascular rupture include:\nCraniotomy: This technique is performed by cutting the skull bone to create a small hole in the skull. Using a microsurgical microscope, determine the location of the broken blood vessel and use a titanium clip attached to the neck of the aneurysm, removing the aneurysm from the blood flow, helping the blood no longer flow into the aneurysm but can circulate in the aneurysm. normal vascular lumen. The titanium clip is fixed in the patient's brain for life and cannot be removed.\nIn particular, the most modern brain surgery technique today is the Modus V Synaptive robot application. Licensed for the first time in Vietnam, Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City owns this most modern brain surgery robot, combined with nerve bundle MRI (DTI) technique, allowing doctors to see See images of nerve conduction bundles that correlate with the brain area that is hemorrhaging or damaged. Accordingly, from the simulated surgery using the Robot, the surgeon will avoid damaging nerve conduction bundles during surgery, preserve nerve fiber bundles and healthy brain tissue, and avoid neurological complications. during and after surgery.\nCerebral artery bypass: With cerebral artery bypass, the doctor takes a small vessel in the patient's body (usually from the lower leg or temporal artery) to bypass the ruptured artery, from That creates a new path for blood. A craniotomy to completely block the flow of the artery and the aneurysm and then a cerebral artery bypass will be performed in cases where the ruptured artery is severely damaged or the aneurysm is large and inaccessible.\nCerebral vascular intervention\nPatients with ruptured blood vessels in the brain can receive vascular intervention by:\nCoil button: The doctor will insert the catheter into the artery in the groin and into the blood vessels in the brain to the location of the broken blood vessel. Through it, platinum coils will be inserted to fill the aneurysm. As the aneurysm fills, the flow will gradually decrease and a blood clot will appear and seal the aneurysm.; Placing a cerebral vascular stent: Another technique for treating ruptured cerebral blood vessels is placing a stent in the blood vessel, creating a shelf in the vessel, occluding the aneurysm, and adjusting the flow in the cerebral vessel.\nIn addition, the doctor may give the patient injections of drugs that relax constricted blood vessels to prevent vasospasm.
