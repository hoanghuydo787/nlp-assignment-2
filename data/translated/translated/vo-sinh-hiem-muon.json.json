    "content": "What is infertility? Causes, signs and treatments\n\nInfertility is becoming a disease of the times. It is alarming that the current infertility rate in Vietnam is up to 7.7%, of which more than half comes from couples under 30 years old. This condition not only hinders the dream of parenthood, but society faces a population shortage as the birth rate declines.\n\nWhat is infertility?\nInfertility according to the definition of the World Health Organization (WHO) is a condition in which a couple lives together and has regular sexual intercourse without using any contraceptive method but after 1 year (with the wife under 35 years old) and after 6 months (with wife over 35 years old) but still not pregnant naturally.\nThe Asia-Pacific region is the region with the lowest fertility and highest infertility rates. This trend is increasing the number of women who are having fewer and fewer children, delaying the age of childbearing or not having children at all. (first)\nIn Vietnam, the birth rate has been steadily decreasing for two decades. According to some studies in 8 provinces representing 8 ecological regions of our country, there are from 700,000 to 1 million couples experiencing infertility.\n\nSigns of infertility\nInfertility can progress silently. The disease is often discovered when a couple is expecting a child but after a period of time still unable to conceive naturally, they visit a specialist and discover the problem. Besides, there are some signs that can warn of infertility in men and women such as: (2)\nIn men\nReduced sexual desire, erectile dysfunction, reduced erection phenomenon;; The testicles are swollen and painful, lumps or lumps appear in the testicles;; The testicles atrophy or become smaller;; Achieving orgasm but not ejaculating...\nIn women\nAbnormal menstruation in terms of menstrual flow and cycle length (too little, too much, too long or too short);; Reduced sexual desire;; Amenorrhea;; There are changes in weight such as uncontrolled weight gain or loss;; Hormonal changes, skin acne, hair loss;; Pain in the lower abdomen;; Vaginal discharge is profuse, has an unusual color and odor.\n\nCauses of infertility and subfertility\n40% of infertility causes come from men, 40% come from women, and the remaining 20% ​​come from both sides or have unknown causes. (3)\nCauses of infertility in men include:\nSperm abnormalities: weak, few, non-mobile, and highly deformed sperm all affect the ability to get pregnant naturally.; Diseases affecting reproductive health: varicocele, testicular atrophy, undescended testicles, tumors, urinary tract infections, cancer, retrograde ejaculation, celiac disease, anti-sperm antibodies... ; History of previous surgery such as vasectomy, surgery in the inguinal and scrotal area...; Working in environments exposed to chemicals, radioactive substances, electromagnetism, high temperature places...; Lifestyles include smoking, drinking alcohol, using stimulants, banned substances and fast food...\nCauses of infertility in women include:\nUterine diseases such as: chronic endometritis, uterine septum, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, uterine polyps, uterine deformities, thin uterine lining...; Premature ovarian failure;; Abnormalities in the fallopian tubes such as fluid retention, inflammation, strictures, previous surgery to remove both fallopian tubes;; Pelvic inflammatory disease, chlamydia fungal infection, sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea, syphilis...; There is hyperprolactinemia.\n\nMethods of diagnosing infertility\nThere are many methods to diagnose infertility in men and women. Depending on each case, medical history and time of pregnancy, the doctor will conduct a number of different tests and indications. Examination methods for men and women are different, so to effectively assess the couple's reproductive health and optimize treatment time, the couple should visit each other for examination.\nTo diagnose infertility in men, the doctor will conduct some necessary tests and ultrasounds such as:\nSemen test: this is the first test in checking male reproductive health.; Immunoassay: to rule out sexually transmitted diseases that may affect fertility.; Endocrine testing: to evaluate reproductive function and related issues; Post-ejaculation urine test: often indicated when retrograde ejaculation is suspected; Genetic testing: genetic abnormalities that can lead to infertility such as Klinefelter syndrome 47XXY, AZF deletion, gene mutation...; Sperm DNA breakage test: if the rate of sperm DNA breakage is too high above 30%, it will reduce the chance of natural pregnancy.; Some necessary ultrasounds include: testicular ultrasound and abdominal ultrasound.\nTo diagnose infertility in women, doctors will prescribe tests, ultrasounds and surveys such as:\nAMH test: to check ovarian reserve, predict the number of eggs remaining in the ovaries.; Immune test: to check for diseases that affect the ability to get pregnant such as HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis B...; Chlamydia test: Chlamydia infection can lead to infection, causing inflammation of organs such as fallopian tubes, pelvic adhesions, adnexa...; Thyroid test: to screen for thyroid disease, which can affect pregnancy, increase the possibility of premature birth, low birth weight, stillbirth or miscarriage.; Endocrine tests FSH, LH, prolactin, P4, E2; Breast and cervical cancer screening tests; Gynecological ultrasound to evaluate reproductive organs.; Ultrasound to count secondary follicles to evaluate ovarian reserve.; Ultrasound monitors the development of ovarian follicles to assess whether the ovaries respond to the ovarian stimulation regimen being used or not; Ultrasound of uterine pumping.; X-ray of uterus and fallopian tubes; Diagnostic hysteroscopy.\n\nHow to treat infertility\nHow infertility treatment is performed and what methods are used in infertility treatment is something that many couples are interested in. Currently, there are many treatment methods with high success rates, helping couples to welcome their own children. Depending on the cause of infertility, there will be different treatment methods. (4)\nInfertility treatments for men include:\nSurgery: surgery is often indicated for cases such as: patients with varicocele, vas deferens reconstruction, patients with azoospermia due to blockages in the testicles, in the epididymis...; Treatment of diseases that affect sexual ability such as erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation...; Using drugs and hormones to stimulate testicular activity, treat spermatogenesis abnormalities due to hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction; Treatment of infections in cases of urinary tract infections, genital infections...; Assisted reproductive techniques such as IUI artificial insemination, IVF in vitro fertilization, ICSI sperm injection...; Cryopreserve sperm.\nInfertility treatments for women include:\nSurgery: In cases where women have abnormalities in the uterus such as polyps, fibroids, cysts, uterine adhesions, septa or fallopian tube blockage, fluid retention, surgery will be indicated; Using medication: if infertility is due to hormonal disorders that affect the ovulation process, the doctor will use some ovulation-stimulating drugs to regulate the ovulation cycle.; Assisted reproductive techniques such as IUI artificial insemination, IVF in vitro fertilization, ICSI sperm injection, IVM immature egg maturation...; Freezing eggs, using donated eggs or surrogacy...\nInfertility can still have children if you closely cooperate and comply with the treatment regimen of the doctors.\n\nMeasures to prevent infertility\nConsidered a disease of the times, how to prevent infertility is a concern of many people. In addition to unpreventable genetic diseases that can lead to infertility, changing lifestyle and daily habits is said to contribute to preventing infertility such as:\nPractice a healthy lifestyle, do not smoke, limit alcohol, do not use stimulants or banned substances; Practicing sports as a habit to improve health, husband and wife should choose simple, gentle exercises such as yoga, swimming, walking... and should not overuse sports.; Maintain a reasonable weight, have a nutritious diet, eat lots of vegetables, fruits, protein supplements... limit processed foods, fried foods, and foods containing many additives.; Healthy sex, monogamy.; Do not abuse abortion; See an infertility doctor as soon as you encounter reproductive health warning problems.\nTam Anh General Hospital's Fertility Support Center brings together a team of doctors and nurses who are leading experts in the field of infertility treatment, possessing modern machinery and equipment systems.
