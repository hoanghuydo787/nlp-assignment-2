    "content": "Cosmetic (silicon) breast implant rupture: causes, signs and treatment\n\nBreast implants are not guaranteed to last a lifetime, breast implants can still burst. The average lifespan of a breast implant is about 10 years. If the breast implant ruptures silently, it is difficult for the patient to detect. So what are the causes, signs and complications of breast implant rupture (silicon)?\n\nWhat is a ruptured breast implant?\nBreast Implant Rupture is a condition in which the breast implant is cracked, torn and the gel flows slowly, very slowly and rarely comes out, located in the dissection cavity, without causing bleeding. After a breast implant ruptures, the silicone can be inside the capsule (when limited by the surrounding fibrous capsule) or outside the capsule (when the silicon freely escapes).\nIntracapsular rupture occurs when the breast implant shell ruptures but the fibrous capsule remains intact. Silicon does not escape. This makes it difficult to detect ruptured sacs during clinical examination or mammography.; Extracapsular rupture can change the contour of the breast. This condition can be detected during a clinical examination or mammography.\n\nAre breast implants fragile?\nSaline and silicone gel implants are designed to last for many years. However, they will not last forever. The silicone shell that holds the saline solution and silicone gel will eventually wear off, leading to minor leaks or ruptured breast implants.\nBreast implant manufacturers claim that their products have an average lifespan of at least 10 years. However, there are still cases where breast implants last for a longer or shorter time.\n\nCommon causes of breast implant rupture\nEveryday movement can eventually lead to normal wear and tear of the breast implant shell. However, there are factors that can cause breast implant shells to deteriorate faster:\nCapsular contracture: the fibrous tissue that forms around the breast implant contracts and compresses the implant, potentially causing rupture; Filling above or below the implant.; Trauma to the chest.; Injuries caused by surgery.\n\nSigns of breast implant rupture\nPatients can recognize a ruptured breast implant by the following signs on the mammary gland, usually on one side:\nPain, tenderness or swelling; Change in size or shape.; Lumps in the breast; There are places where the breast is hard.\nBreast implants can burst at any time. Breast implant rupture that does not cause any symptoms is called “silent rupture.” Silent breast implant rupture does not change the shape of the breast, so it is difficult to detect the crack. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an effective method to detect this condition.\nMRI scan helps identify breast implant rupture.\n\nComplications of breast implant rupture (silicon)\nRupture of silicone breast implants can cause breast pain or changes in the contour or shape of the breast. However, ruptured silicone breast implants do not cause breast cancer, nor do they cause fertility problems or connective tissue diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.\nWhen silicone implants rupture, it is often silent and may go unnoticed because the silicone tends to become trapped in the surrounding breast tissue. This is called subcapsular rupture or asymptomatic silent rupture.\nHowever, surrounding breast tissue may become irritated and swollen. Fibrodermal scar tissue may also form.\n\nWhen should you screen for breast implant rupture?\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends:\n3 years after the first breast implant surgery and every 2 years thereafter: people with silicone breast implants should be examined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to check for signs of \"silent rupture\" of the breasts. silent” or not.; Breast implants change in size or shape: The two breasts are uneven in size and shape.\n\nHow to diagnose a ruptured breast implant?\nIf you have silicone breast implants and suspect that the implant may have ruptured, talk to your plastic surgeon. Imaging tests, such as a breast MRI or breast ultrasound, can show whether an implant has ruptured.\n1. Mammography\nIt is very difficult to detect cracks in breast implants (especially cracks in silicone breast implants) on mammograms. Detection of cracks in silicone breast implants in the capsule is almost impossible to see with this method.\n2. Ultrasound\nUltrasound may show signs of extracapsular rupture as silicone escapes and enters the mammary tissue. Ultrasound has poor sensitivity and specificity.\n3. Breast MRI\nBreast MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is the most sensitive method in detecting breast implant rupture. Using MRI to examine breast implant rupture may not require contrast injection. With the use of multiplanar imaging, MRI can also differentiate between radial folds or fissures.\nIn addition, contrast-free MRI can also differentiate between silicone implants and saline implants.\nBreast implants do not last forever.\n\nHow to treat ruptured breast implants\nIf you have a silent rupture – that is, a breast implant with a rupture that causes no clinical signs or symptoms at all – then consulting your plastic surgeon will explain possible treatment options. exam.\nSome women choose a wait-and-see approach, while others prefer to have the ruptured implant removed or replaced. Ask your surgeon to help you weigh the pros and cons of each approach based on your current symptoms.\nRupture of a silicone implant causes signs or symptoms, and your surgeon may recommend surgery to remove the implant. If you want to have new breast implants placed right away, surgery can usually be done at the same time.\nIf you no longer want to have new breast implants immediately, you can consider with your doctor a breast lift to avoid sagging or other corrective surgery, on the same or opposite side.\n\nHow to prevent breast implant rupture?\nHowever, keep in mind that breast implants are not guaranteed to last a lifetime.\nYou should continue to have regular annual screening with daily clinical breast examination, combined with breast ultrasound and mammography within the allowable age (from 40 years of age and older); If there are any other new changes, see your plastic surgeon for follow-up and review of treatment options.\nDoctor of Breast Surgery Department, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City is performing surgery.\n\nHow to care for breast implants?\nTake your time to recover and follow your doctor's instructions! After breast implant surgery, patients need to follow the following measures to ensure the wound heals quickly and maintain the breasts as desired:\nTake time to recover: after surgery, patients should stay home for a few days; Avoid sleeping on your side or stomach for at least 6 weeks.; Do not drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes and blood thinners such as aspirin.; Avoid getting the wound wet for 3 - 5 days after surgery.; Do not wear an underwire bra for about 6 weeks after discharge from the hospital.; Do not exercise vigorously because it may tear the stitches. In order not to affect the wound healing process, patients can exercise by walking in the first few weeks after surgery.; Apply lotion to your breasts regularly to moisturize, increase elasticity, and help firm your breasts.; Maintain a stable weight by eating healthy.\nDepartment of Breast Surgery, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City with a team of experts and doctors with rich experience in examination, diagnosis, consultation, and in-depth treatment of breast diseases in general and breast cancer in particular.\nIn addition, the Breast Surgery Department is also synchronously invested in modern equipment, imported genuine from European and American countries to help patients improve breast-related problems such as: sagging breasts, increased breast size. breast size, breast reconstruction after mastectomy due to unfortunate breast cancer...\nBreast implant rupture, if detected and treated promptly, will cause little harm to health. In case of late detection, the breast implant bursts outside the capsule and silicon flows out, causing many complications, affecting the patient's health.\nThe above article has provided information about what is breast implant rupture (silicon)? Causes, signs and complications should be noted. Hopefully this will be useful information, helping patients recognize signs of breast implant rupture, thereby receiving timely treatment.",
