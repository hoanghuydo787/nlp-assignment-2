    "content": "Bone calcification: Causes, signs, treatment and prevention\n\nBone calcification is a common condition, greatly affecting daily mobility. This disorder stems from many different causes and can cause serious complications if not detected and treated early. Therefore, proactively implementing preventive measures combined with timely monitoring and examination is really necessary.\n\nWhat is bone calcification?\nBone calcification or bone calcification is the accumulation of Calcium in body tissue, often occurring during the bone formation process. This condition can be a pathology or a natural sign of aging depending on each specific case. Calcified bones are the result of the body protecting itself, or in other words, a natural response to injury, infection and other autoimmune disorders. (first)\nIn general, calcified bones are a common form of degeneration, greatly affecting mobility and daily activities. If treatment is not carried out early, the condition can progress with many other serious complications, even irreversible. Among them, the two most common forms of bone calcification include:\nCalcification of the cervical spine\nThe cervical spine is responsible for rotating, supinating, bending, bending and balancing the head. Bone calcification occurs here mainly due to incorrect lying or sitting posture or injury.\nCalcification of the lumbar spine\nThe lumbar spine is very susceptible to calcification due to high pressure from body weight and damage caused by daily movements (walking, sitting, lying, carrying...). This condition often occurs commonly after the age of 40. In addition, young people who have the habit of sitting a lot and being sedentary are also at risk group.\n\nSigns of bone calcification\nDepending on the location of formation, bone calcification will appear with different symptoms, specifically as follows:\nBone calcification appears inside the joint or deep in the tissue: It will be very difficult for the patient to notice obvious symptoms.; Bone calcification forms near the skin: Small bumps appear on the skin surface; Bone calcification develops in the shoulder: It is difficult to move the arm normally due to pain, and the range of motion is limited.; Spinal calcification: Spinal nerves are compressed, causing numbness or pain in the arms, legs or other areas of the body. If the spines grow deep inside, it can lead to spinal stenosis, making it difficult to stand upright and walk.; Calcification develops in the knees: Patients find it difficult to perform normal movements such as moving up and down stairs, getting in and out of cars...; Calcification develops on the heel: The patient finds it difficult to touch the ground or walk.; Calcification develops in the cervical spine: This condition causes arteries or veins to be compressed, blood flow to the brain is limited, and the trachea can also be pressed on, causing difficulty swallowing.\n\nCauses of bone calcification\nBone calcification comes from a number of main causes as follows: (2)\nInfection.; Calcium metabolism disorder.; Genetic or autoimmune disorders affecting the skeletal system or connective tissues; Persistent inflammation causes tissue damage and stimulates the body to release proteins that bind calcium to form hard blocks; Stressed or damaged bones: In this case, Calcium will move through the bloodstream to the injured area to perform repair, leading to calcium accumulation, which gradually hardens when not detected and treated promptly. time.; Many misconceptions still believe that the habit of eating a lot of calcium is one of the causes of bone calcification. However, studies have not found a link between these two factors.\nRisk factor\nWomen over 40 years old.; People with a sedentary lifestyle cause Calcium to accumulate in soft tissues instead of being taken to the necessary places to maintain bone strength.; Aging.; Tendons are damaged; Genetic.; Abnormal activity of the thyroid gland.; Some substances produced by the body to fight inflammation.; Metabolic diseases, including diabetes.\n\nComplications of bone calcification may occur\nBone calcification becomes a concern when the location, shape or size causes tissue damage. Some typical complications can include the following:\nCalcification hardens and clogs blood vessels in the heart, brain, and kidneys; Gradual calcification leads to the formation of spurs and bone spurs in the paravertebral ligaments. When the size is too large, they will begin to compress the nerves, leading to muscle weakness and even loss of motor function in the long term. ; Irritation of surrounding tissues, leading to inflammation; Some cases of calcification spread to the shoulders, arms, and legs when nerves are compressed or damaged, causing severe pain.\n\nDiagnostic method\nFor bone calcification, the doctor will initially conduct a physical examination and ask a number of questions related to the location of pain, pain level and specific symptoms. Then, diagnostic methods can be performed to ensure the most accurate conclusions are drawn, including: (3)\nX-ray: X-ray uses electromagnetic radiation to obtain images of bones, organs inside the body and excess Calcium accumulated on bones.; Ultrasound: Ultrasound may be prescribed to detect small calcium deposits that cannot be identified by X-ray methods; Biopsy: In some cases, your doctor may request a biopsy, specifically collecting a tissue sample and sending it to a laboratory to detect cancer (if any).\n\nHow to treat bone calcification\nBone calcification cannot be cured completely, the main measures are aimed at reducing pain. For this condition, depending on the severity, your doctor may prescribe some of the following treatments: (4)\nPerform physical therapy and exercise: This is a basic solution, focusing on improving symptoms and slowing down the process of bone degeneration and calcification. At the same time, exercises also have the effect of relaxing muscle tendons, helping to significantly reduce common pain symptoms. However, the implementation process requires perseverance and the right method to ensure high efficiency.; Infrared ray treatment: In some cases, the doctor will prescribe infrared ray treatment, specifically shining a light on the calcified bone area to reduce pain. The pain relief effect will not last long but can temporarily improve uncomfortable symptoms, helping patients limit their dependence on medication.; Using over-the-counter pain relievers (Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, Naproxen sodium...): This is a temporary pain relief method and does not have a complete treatment effect. However, patients should not use it for a long time to avoid affecting their stomach and health. In most cases, this method is only indicated when other treatments are ineffective. In addition, patients should absolutely follow the doctor's instructions to avoid unwanted side effects.; Surgery: If all medical treatments do not bring any improvement, your doctor may prescribe surgery.\nFor bone calcification, no matter what treatment method is used, the doctor will ask the patient to have regular follow-up examinations to check for potential complications. This will help promptly control other serious problems, ensuring the most favorable treatment and recovery process.\n\nMeasures to prevent bone calcification\nBone calcification can be proactively prevented early on with some useful solutions as follows:\nCarry out regular health examinations to check the amount of Calcium in the bones and detect abnormalities related to bone calcification (if any).; Some medications or therapies can affect the body's ability to metabolize calcium, such as blood pressure regulators, cholesterol, hormone replacement therapy, etc. Therefore, patients should discuss carefully. consult a doctor before use to avoid unwanted problems.; Quit the habit of smoking to avoid the risk of calcification in bones, heart and arteries.; Build a healthy diet, ensuring to provide the necessary amount of Calcium every day for the body with the following foods: seeds (sesame, chia seeds...), cheese, yogurt, almonds, kinds of beanâ€¦; Maintain a regular exercise routine every day to keep bones strong, improve blood circulation, and help the body transport Calcium to where it is needed instead of accumulating it in soft tissues.\nCenter for Orthopedic Trauma, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is where a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons gather such as: TTND.Prof.Dr.Nguyen Viet Tien; Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa; Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh; MSc.BS.CKII Tran Anh Vu; BS.CKI Tran Xuan Anh, MSc.CKI Le Dinh Khoa, PhD.Do Tien Dung; Dr. BS.CKII Vu Huu Dung... This is also one of the pioneer units in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal diseases with modern techniques according to updated international protocols.\nThe hospital is also equipped with modern machinery and imaging equipment such as: Somatom Drive 768-slice CT scanner, new generation Magnetom Amira BioMatrix magnetic resonance machine, Artis Pheno robot, densitometer. bones, ultrasound machines...; Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss surgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table... to be able to detect injuries early and effectively treat musculoskeletal diseases...\nTam Anh General Hospital also owns a spacious clinic system and high-class boarding area; modern rehabilitation area; Comprehensive post-operative care process helps patients quickly recover and stabilize their health after surgery.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Orthopedics Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nAbove is a summary of all information related to bone calcification. Hopefully through these shares, patients will update more useful knowledge to proactively prevent, monitor and treat early, limiting dangerous complications later.",
