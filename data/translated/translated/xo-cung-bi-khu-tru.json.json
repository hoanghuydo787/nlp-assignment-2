    "content": "Localized scleroderma: Causes, signs, treatment, prevention\n\nLocalized scleroderma is a rare medical condition but has the risk of causing dangerous complications if not detected and treated early. The disease appears with many diverse symptoms that are relatively easy to recognize. From there, depending on the severity and stage of the disease, the doctor will prescribe appropriate treatment methods.\n\nWhat is localized scleroderma?\nLocalized scleroderma is a rare condition that causes painless discolored patches on the skin, mainly appearing on the face, arms and legs. Over time, these areas gradually become thicker, drier, and harder, but tend to only affect the outer layer of skin. In rare cases, the disease affects deeper tissues, limiting joint movement. Usually, this condition will improve on its own over time but there is a high chance of recurrence. (first)\nSee more: What is scleroderma?\n\nCause of localized scleroderma\nThe cause of localized scleroderma has not yet been accurately determined. This is considered a form of autoimmune disease, occurring when the body's immune system attacks the skin. At this time, collagen-producing cells must be overactive. Specifically, collagen is a protein that participates in supporting skin structure. If produced more than normal, it will cause the skin to become stiff. (2)\nIn addition, this condition can also occur due to radiotherapy, repeated trauma, infection, exposure to chemicals, medication... Localized scleroderma is not infectious when touching the patient. .\nRisk factor\nGender: Female.; White skin-man.; Age: The disease affects all ages but is most common in the period from 2 to 14 years old or mid-40s.; Family history of having the disease.\nReference: Symptoms of systemic scleroderma\n\nSymptoms of localized scleroderma\nIn general, localized scleroderma is recognized by the appearance of patches of discolored skin that are thick and may be oval in shape. The inside is usually red, the outer edge can be lilac. Towards the center of the oval, the color gradually changes to white or yellow. Exact symptoms will vary depending on the severity and type of injury, as follows:\nPlaque morphea: This is the most common type, usually appearing with 3-4 oval plaques, painless but can cause itching.; Generalized plaque morphea: This is a type of sclerosis with more widespread damage, affecting deeper tissues and potentially leading to deformity.; Deep scleroderma (Pansclerotic morphea): This type progresses rapidly with many plaques covering almost the entire body (except the hands and feet) and requires prompt treatment.; Linear morphea: The characteristic symptom is a thick, discolored band of skin, often on the arms, legs or forehead. This type is often found in school-aged children. The damage can spread to subcutaneous tissue, even muscles, bones and lead to deformities. In addition, if this condition appears on the face, it can cause problems related to teeth and eyes.\nIf the patient notices hard and red patches appearing on the skin, they should immediately contact a doctor for early examination. Early diagnosis and treatment will slow the progression of the disease. In addition, this also helps doctors identify and control complications before the condition becomes more serious.\n\nIs localized scleroderma dangerous?\nLocalized scleroderma appearing on the face, neck or deep, widespread lesions, if not treated early, can lead to the following dangerous complications: (3)\nRestriction of joint mobility; Athritis.; Deformities.; Permanent eye damage in children.; Hair loss,â€¦\nSome people with this disease also have sclerosis in their genitals. Common symptoms are itching and unusual changes on the skin, which need to be examined and treated promptly.\n\nDiagnostic method\nFor localized scleroderma, the doctor will initially examine the affected skin area and ask some questions related to symptoms. Then, several diagnostic methods can be performed to reach the most accurate conclusion, including:\nBlood tests: Blood tests help doctors distinguish this condition from some other diseases.; Ultrasound: 10 - 25 MHz ultrasound can determine the thickness of the skin, correlating with the severity of the disease.; X-ray: X-ray is the preferred diagnostic method for cases of band sclerosis or localized scleroderma that has gone deep inside, affecting the bones.; EEG: An EEG will show abnormalities in people with cranial sclerosis, often localized to areas of the brain below the affected skin and sometimes without a history of seizures. clinical.; Skin biopsy: A small sample of skin will be examined to identify abnormal changes, such as excessive dermal collagen.\nIf a young child has this sclerosis in the head and neck area, parents should take their child for regular eye examinations because the disease can easily cause eye damage that is difficult to detect but cannot be recovered. In addition, patients can also have ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging to monitor disease progression as well as improvement after treatment.\n\nTreatment of localized scleroderma\nLocalized scleroderma can last several years and then resolve without medical treatment. However, the disease can leave scars or areas of skin that are darkened or discolored... Until the condition improves, the patient should take appropriate treatment methods to effectively control symptoms. Below are some common methods often prescribed by doctors: (4)\nSkin creams: Your doctor may prescribe certain Vitamin D creams, such as Calcipotriene, to help soften your skin. Symptoms often show signs of improvement during the first months of use. However, common side effects are burning, stinging and rash.; Corticosteroid cream: This cream reduces inflammation, but continuous use over a long period of time can cause skin thinning and many other complications.; Light therapy: For serious conditions and widespread damage, your doctor may prescribe light therapy.; Oral medications: For serious conditions and widespread damage, your doctor may also prescribe prescription medications. These are immunosuppressive drugs such as Methotrexate, Corticosteroid, Hydroxychloroquine, Mycophenolate Mofetil. Each of these drugs has potential side effects, so patients need to discuss carefully with their doctor before using to avoid unwanted side effects.; Physical therapy: If this injury affects the joints, physical therapy may be prescribed to improve mobility.\n\nPrevention of localized scleroderma\nLocalized scleroderma can lead to a number of serious complications if not detected and treated early. Therefore, applying preventive solutions right from the beginning is really necessary, including:\nMaintain an exercise habit: Regular exercise helps the body become more flexible, improves blood circulation and effectively reduces stiffness. In particular, exercises with a variety of movements can keep the skin and joints in the best condition. This is really important for preventing scleroderma from forming.; Skin protection: Dry skin needs special care by using moisturizer and sunscreen regularly. In addition, the habit of bathing in water that is too hot, bathing with soap containing strong detergents, contact with chemicals... should also be limited to avoid causing irritation.; Protect your hands and feet from cold by wearing warm gloves and boots in winter.; Give up the habit of smoking; Use a humidifier in your living space to avoid dry skin, especially in winter.\nCenter for Orthopedic Trauma, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is where a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons gather such as: TTND.Prof.Dr.Nguyen Viet Tien; Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa; Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh; MSc.BS.CKII Tran Anh Vu; BS.CKI Tran Xuan Anh, MSc.CKI Le Dinh Khoa, PhD.Do Tien Dung; Dr. BS.CKII Vu Huu Dung... This is also one of the pioneer units in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal diseases with modern techniques according to updated international protocols.\nThe hospital is also equipped with modern machinery and imaging equipment such as: Somatom Drive 768-slice CT scanner, new generation Magnetom Amira BioMatrix magnetic resonance machine, Artis Pheno robot, densitometer. bones, ultrasound machines...; Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss surgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table... to be able to detect injuries early and effectively treat musculoskeletal diseases...\nTam Anh General Hospital also owns a spacious clinic system and high-class boarding area; modern rehabilitation area; Comprehensive post-operative care process helps patients quickly recover and stabilize their health after surgery.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Orthopedics Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nAbove is a summary of information related to localized scleroderma. Hopefully with these shares, patients will have more useful updates to proactively prevent, detect and treat effectively.",
