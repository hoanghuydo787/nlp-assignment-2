    "content": "What is systemic scleroderma? Causes, symptoms and treatment\n\nSystemic scleroderma is a form of scleroderma that affects internal organs. Although rare, this condition can lead to dangerous complications if not treated promptly.\n\nWhat is systemic scleroderma?\nSystemic sclerosis or systemic sclerosis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the skin and internal organs. This condition is more serious than localized scleroderma, which only affects the skin, can get better over time, and even go away on its own without treatment.\nLearn more about scleroderma here.\n\nClassify\nMSc.BS.CKI Tran Thi Thanh Tu, Center for Orthopedic Trauma - Tam Anh General Hospital System shared that systemic sclerosis is divided into three types:\n1. Diffuse scleroderma\nDiffuse systemic scleroderma is a fibrosis condition that affects large areas of the skin, including the skin of the whole body, the skin of the upper arms and the legs... Internal organs such as the kidneys, lungs, heart and digestive tract can also be damaged. At this time, the skin becomes tight, often accompanied by dryness and itching. Patients may also feel musculoskeletal pain. Acute systemic high blood pressure can cause kidney damage. The disease becomes life-threatening if the lungs or heart are seriously affected.\n2. Scleroderma is limited to the skin\nScleroderma limited to the skin is the most common type of scleroderma. Fibrosis only affects the skin in certain areas: Hands, arms and face. However, in rare cases, scleroderma limited to the skin can cause other problems and is called CREST syndrome:\nC – Calcinosis (calcification nodules): Calcium deposition forms small tumors that appear in connective tissues; R – Raynaud's phenomenon (Raynaud's phenomenon): Hands and feet are anemic, turning white, blue-purple; E – Esophageal dysfunction: Causes difficulty in swallowing; S – Sclerodactyly (stiff fingers): Proliferation creates excess collagen in the skin, causing the fingers to become thick and stiff; T – Telangiectasia (telangiectasia): Small blood vessels swell and dilate, causing small red spots to appear on the hands and face.\n3. Sinusoidal scleroderma\nSine sclerosis is a phenomenon that occurs when fibrosis only affects internal organs, but does not affect the skin.\n\nCause of systemic sclerosis\nSystemic scleroderma occurs due to excessive collagen proliferation and its accumulation in tissues. However, today's medicine has not yet found the exact cause of this collagen proliferation, only knowing that the immune system and a combination of other risk factors play a certain role. Some risk factors include:\nGenetic; Mutations in certain genes may affect the risk of developing the disease; Exposure to a number of agents such as viruses, drugs, chemicals, drugs...; The body's immune system malfunctions, destroying connective tissue; Suffering from connective tissue disorders such as: polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus...; Female hormones (the disease is more common in women than men).\n\nSymptoms of generalized scleroderma\nThe symptoms and severity of systemic sclerosis will vary from person to person.\n1. Skin\nThe skin is the most obvious manifestation of scleroderma. The skin of a person with the disease will appear in patches that are tight, hard and shiny, limiting movement. Skin patches are oval, large or small.\n2. Fingers and toes\nRaynaud's phenomenon results from scleroderma limited to the skin. At this time, small blood vessels in the fingers and toes begin to contract (especially when exposed to cold), causing pain or numbness, and turning blue/white/red.\n3. Digestive tract\nSystemic scleroderma can affect some parts or the entire digestive tract, causing problems in:\nEsophagus: Acidity or difficulty swallowing; Intestinal: Bloating, diarrhea, constipation...; Nutritional deficiencies.\n4. Heart, lungs and kidneys\nSystemic scleroderma can affect other organs, including the heart, lungs, and kidneys. When it develops to this stage, the disease can be life-threatening if not treated, especially damage to the kidneys.\n\nIs generalized scleroderma dangerous?\nAccording to Dr. Thanh Tu, although there is still no cure for scleroderma, most patients can \"live peacefully\" with the disease if they receive appropriate treatment.\nIn some cases, the disease will lead to complications such as:\nStomachache; Gastroesophageal reflux disease; Hiatal hernia; Barrett's esophagus; Bowel obstruction; Pulmonary hypertension; High Blood Pressure; Transient ischemic attack and stroke; Arthritis; Myositis; Heart disease; Heart arrhythmia; Pericarditis; Kidney disease caused by scleroderma\n\nDiagnostic method\nThere is no specific test for systemic sclerosis. This pathology will be diagnosed by a combination of clinical examination and some tests.\nClinical examination\nFind out your medical history, personal and family history of autoimmune diseases; Current physical condition and symptoms; Perform physical tests\nAdditional tests\nEchocardiography evaluates pulmonary hypertension; Screening for specific antibodies of scleroderma; CT scan – Chest scan; X-ray of the hand; Exploration of respiratory function; Esophageal pressure measurement; ECG; Complete blood cell analysis; Complete urinalysis; Check liver and kidney function; Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy; NT – pro – BNP test\n\nHow to treat systemic scleroderma\nSystemic sclerosis cannot be cured completely. The goals of currently available treatments are mainly focused on relieving symptoms, slowing disease progression, and preventing complications. Each treatment will be planned based on the diagnosis, type of systemic sclerosis, and severity. Treatment methods include:\nCorticosteroids; Immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate or cytoxan; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); Blood pressure medication; Respiratory support drugs; Get regular dental care to prevent damage to your mouth and teeth; Physical therapy exercises\nFor Raynaud's syndrome, patients will be treated with additional medications such as:\nNitroglycerine 2% ointment as a topical treatment; Calcium channel blockers, such as Nifedipine\n\nPrevention of systemic sclerosis\nThe cause of the disease has not yet been found, so it is difficult to prevent scleroderma. However, improving overall health will have a positive effect in supporting the treatment and control of systemic sclerosis. Accordingly, patients should:\nRegular exercise: Helps blood circulate easily, reduces hardening of the skin's epidermis; Use lotion, sunscreen, avoid bathing in too hot water or using soaps with strong detergents to protect your skin; Keep your body warm, wear gloves, cover your face and head carefully to protect your skin from cold weather; Scientific diet, limit foods that increase the risk of heartburn or increase stomach acid; Don't smoke: Nicotine in cigarettes will constrict blood vessels, making the condition worse. Smoking also causes permanent narrowing of blood vessels, exacerbating lung problems.\nCenter for Orthopedic Trauma, Tam Anh General Hospital System, is where a team of leading experts, experienced, dedicated, and enthusiastic surgeons gather such as: TTND.Prof.Dr.Nguyen Viet Tien; Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa; Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh; MSc. Tran Anh Vu; Dr. Tran Xuan Anh, Dr. Le Dinh Khoa, Dr. Do Tien Dung; Dr. BS.CKII Vu Huu Dung... This is also one of the pioneer units in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal diseases with modern techniques according to updated international protocols.\nThe hospital is also equipped with modern machinery and imaging equipment such as: Somatom Drive 768-slice CT scanner, new generation Magnetom Amira BioMatrix magnetic resonance machine, Artis Pheno robot, densitometer. bones, ultrasound machines...; Opmi Vario 700 Zeiss surgical microscope system, Meera-Maquet operating table... to be able to detect injuries early and effectively treat musculoskeletal diseases...\nTam Anh General Hospital also owns a spacious clinic system and high-class boarding area; modern rehabilitation area; Comprehensive post-operative care process helps patients quickly recover and stabilize their health after surgery.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Orthopedics Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nAlthough scleroderma cannot be completely cured, early recognition of symptoms helps control the disease effectively and prevent complications.",
