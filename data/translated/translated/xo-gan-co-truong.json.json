    "content": "Cirrhosis ascites: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis, prevention\n\nCirrhosis ascites, is a chronic disease from liver damage and scarring leading to impaired liver function. The health of people with cirrhosis and ascites will be seriously impaired because of the effects of the disease, accompanied by symptoms of cirrhosis. To understand more about this disease as well as its symptoms and prevention, please review the information in the article below.\n\nWhat is cirrhosis and ascites?\nDangerous liver disease ascites cirrhosis (also known as ascites cirrhosis) is a dangerous chronic disease that causes severe liver function impairment from liver damage. This type of disease is quite common today when out of every 10 people with liver disease, 8 people have ascites cirrhosis. This is the worry of many people as there is currently no cure for the disease and patients with cirrhosis ascites will face a high risk of death.\nAscites is a yellow fluid called peritoneal fluid. Ascites fluid accumulates, mainly inside the abdominal cavity, when the liver function declines plus fibrosis in the liver, increasing portal vein pressure, thereby creating pressure to push fluid into the abdomen.\nThus, cirrhosis with ascites is a condition that occurs after the liver scars and cirrhosis damages liver tissue, accumulating ascitic fluid in cirrhosis, thereby creating dead cells inside the liver. These dead cells are considered the main cause of the liver's almost complete decline in important functions for the body such as purification, protein creation, blood filtering and cleansing, and fighting infections.\nCommon causes of cirrhosis with ascites and subjects at high risk of cirrhosis with ascites include: Viral hepatitis B, or C and alcohol.\n\nSymptoms of cirrhosis and ascites\nDepending on the cause of cirrhosis, each person will have different time to develop symptoms. Cirrhosis of the liver with ascites often develops symptoms quite slowly, and it is difficult for patients to detect the disease until it enters the final stages. Advice from doctors and health professionals to proactively prevent or detect the disease early by performing screening and monitoring every 6 months in people at risk such as hepatitis B virus, C, people who drink a lot of alcohol...\nThe common point of patients with cirrhosis and ascites is:\nEnlarged liver for alcoholic cirrhosis and cardiac cirrhosis; Distention; Weight changes rapidly and for unknown reasons, especially when edema and ascites are severe\nIn addition, patients will also experience some other symptoms of cirrhosis and ascites such as:\nAbdominal pain, nausea and difficulty breathing are caused by the accumulation of abdominal fluid. Leads to boredom or loss of appetite; Nausea; Swollen hands and feet; Red palms and feet; Back-ache; Difficulty sitting; Having digestive problems such as constipation, indigestion, etc.; Possible gastrointestinal bleeding: vomiting blood, black stools\nIn addition, if you experience the following symptoms of cirrhosis with ascites, you need to see a doctor for an in-depth examination because these are symptoms of end-stage cirrhosis with ascites:\nEnlarged spleen; Visible dilated blood vessels on the skin of the chest and neck area; Skin bruises and bleeds more easily; Yellowing of the skin and eyes; There may be dizziness or coma\nYellow eyes and skin are signs of cirrhosis and ascites\n\nCauses of cirrhosis and ascites\nKnown causes of cirrhosis and ascites include:\nLeading is viral hepatitis B or C; Alcohol is an increasingly common cause of cirrhosis in Vietnam. People with chronic hepatitis B or C infection who drink a lot of alcohol are more likely to develop cirrhosis; Other causes include: cirrhosis due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis or secondary to gallstones, primary sclerosing cholangitis, metabolic diseases: Copper metabolism disorders like Wilson, iron metabolism disorders like Hemochromatosis... Liver cirrhosis may occur due to heart disease\n\nDiagnosis of cirrhosis and ascites\nTo diagnose cirrhosis ascites, you can observe changes in your health and body. If your body has symptoms similar to those of ascites, you should see a doctor for advice as well as blood tests and imaging tests. (2)\nSome clinical and paraclinical tests that you can perform to know if you have cirrhosis ascites or not include:\nBlood test: Based on blood test results, the doctor can find abnormal indicators to know whether you have cirrhosis or ascites; Blood test: Based on blood test results, the doctor can find abnormal indicators to know if you have ascites or cirrhosis.\nTomography: Tomography, also known as CT scan, will obtain images of your internal ascites cirrhosis. From there, the doctor will easily diagnose the disease and its stage; Tomography: Tomography, also known as CT scan, will obtain images of your internal ascites cirrhosis. From there, the doctor will easily diagnose the disease and its stage.\nX-ray: The image of cirrhosis and ascites with this method will be diagnosed by the doctor based on the size of the liver. This method is not as advanced as CT scan, but the cost of x-ray is much more reasonable.; X-ray: The image of cirrhosis and ascites with this method will be diagnosed by the doctor based on the size of the liver. This method is not as advanced as CT scan, but the cost of x-ray is much more reasonable.\nLiver biopsy: Liver biopsy is a method of liver screening by taking tissue samples and observing the level of damage and fibrosis of the liver under a microscope. This method will cause pain and discomfort to the practitioner because it requires a biopsy needle to puncture the internal tissue.; Liver biopsy: Liver biopsy is a method of liver screening by taking tissue samples and observing the level of damage and fibrosis of the liver under a microscope. This method will cause pain and discomfort to the practitioner because it requires a biopsy needle to puncture the tissue inside.\n\nComplications of cirrhosis and ascites\nCirrhosis ascites can cause a number of serious complications, affecting the patient's health and resistance. Especially when the disease enters the final stage, the liver almost no longer has the function of detoxifying, leading to the kidneys being forced to take on that part of the job. If this condition occurs frequently, it will cause overload and reduce kidney function.(1)\nAlarmingly, if ascites cirrhosis is not detected promptly or received proper treatment, the patient will face a quite high risk of liver cancer.\nIn addition, some other complications you may also experience if you have ascites cirrhosis include:\nSpontaneous primary bacterial peritonitis; Severe ascites is resistant to treatment; Bleeding due to rupture of real or gastric varices; Experience liver-kidney syndrome; Hepatic encephalopathy\n\nTreatment of cirrhosis and ascites\nCurrently, there is still no method or treatment regimen to completely cure cirrhosis ascites. However, if treated well, the patient can still have an almost normal life and live a long time. Treatment for this disease is aimed at preventing complications of ascites cirrhosis and minimizing damage to the liver.(3)\nMedically, depending on each person's physical condition and medical condition, doctors will have different treatment methods. Some methods can include:\nDon't eat too much salt, monitor your weight every day; Using diuretics to reduce edema and ascites helps the patient feel comfortable and able to eat; Paracentesis of ascites when diuretics do not help; Esophagogastroduodenoscopy to have a plan to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding, this is a serious complication that can be life-threatening; Treatment of the cause: Very important such as treating hepatitis B and C viruses if present. Completely stopping alcohol helps cirrhosis caused by alcohol restore function; Perform liver transplant surgery\nAs for patients, they can proactively maintain their health at a stable level and avoid the disease from getting worse by practicing a reasonable diet and healthy living habits. People with cirrhosis and ascites should note:\nDo not use alcohol or alcoholic beverages; Do not use drugs that are toxic to the liver, do not use unnecessary drugs and drugs of unknown origin because they increase the burden on the liver; Limit foods that are high in fat to avoid digestive difficulties in the diet; Increase protein nutrition to improve health; Limit water and fluids when ascites is severe\n\nIs cirrhosis and ascites contagious?\nCirrhosis ascites is a liver damage problem caused by two main causes: hepatitis B and hepatitis C and alcohol abuse.\nFor people with cirrhosis and ascites caused by alcohol, there is no possibility of infecting others. However, people with cirrhosis and ascites due to hepatitis B or hepatitis C can still infect others through routes similar to hepatitis B virus infection, including:\nFrom mother to child; Having sex without using protection; Blood sugar\n\nIs cirrhosis and ascites dangerous?\nAscites cirrhosis is a dangerous liver disease and has a high mortality rate, up to 90% if in the late stages. Not only that, cirrhosis with ascites is also a precursor to liver cancer, a type of cancer with a 21% cancer mortality rate.\n\nPrevention of cirrhosis and ascites\nAlthough cirrhosis and ascites is a dangerous chronic disease, you can completely proactively prevent it optimally. The best way to prevent not only cirrhosis and ascites but also other liver diseases is to limit alcohol and have a healthy lifestyle. Patients with chronic liver disease such as hepatitis B, C... need to be managed and monitored periodically every 6 months.\nNutrition for people with cirrhosis and ascites\nPatients with cirrhosis and ascites do not need to eat a strict diet. However, patients need to make sure to limit salt in their diet. This helps patients control ascites more effectively. The amount of salt that patients are encouraged to eat is about 2000 - 4000 mg per day.\nFurthermore, to have good health, patients also need to supplement adequate nutrients such as protein, vitamins and fiber. Besides, people with cirrhosis and ascites can also eat other health-supporting foods such as:\nFoods rich in Beta-carotene; Foods containing Omega-3 fatty acids\n\nFrequently asked questions\n1. Can end-stage ascites cirrhosis be cured?\nFor people with cirrhosis and ascites in the final stage, the liver has almost lost all of its original functions and cannot be restored.\nFor treatment, the patient can undergo a liver transplant to be completely cured. End-stage cirrhosis with ascites can still be well controlled and limit the risk of death by changing the appropriate diet and taking medication, especially diuretics to help the kidneys eliminate sodium. However, at this stage, patients need to pay close attention to their lifestyle and nutrition, and closely follow the doctor's treatment regimen to maintain stable health.\n2. Is cirrhosis and ascites cancer?\nCirrhosis ascites is not cancer. This is cirrhosis and the patient also has an accumulation of abdominal fluid, causing deterioration of liver function. However, cirrhosis with ascites can lead to the most serious complication, liver cancer.\n3. What medicine should I take for cirrhosis and ascites? Should I use oriental medicine?\nDepending on each person's condition and symptoms, the doctor will prescribe appropriate medication to reduce symptoms and prevent complications of cirrhosis and ascites.\nDiuretics Spironolactone and Furosemide are two commonly used diuretics on the market today. The medicine helps patients resolve bad conditions related to electrolytes in the blood. And especially, each person will have different dosages.\nUp to now, oriental medicine of clear origin only alleviates some symptoms, but cannot prevent dangerous complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding.\nCenter for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City) and Department of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreatic (Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing High-class, effective examination and treatment services for patients with mild to severe liver problems (fatty liver, acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer...). Tam Anh General Hospital system brings together a team of highly specialized and experienced Internal Medicine - Surgery - Gastrointestinal Endoscopy doctors, in addition to the support of a modern medical equipment system imported from abroad. in addition, serving the maximum examination and treatment needs of customers.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of liver diseases with gastroenterology specialists of Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nCirrhosis ascites is considered a dangerous liver disease, becoming a concern for many people. To effectively prevent disease, you need to be equipped with correct and sufficient knowledge about the disease to take proactive disease prevention measures, combined with building a healthy lifestyle to minimize the risk of disease.
