    "content": "Compensated cirrhosis: Symptoms, diagnosis and treatment\n\nCompensated cirrhosis is a condition in which the liver is fibrotic but has virtually no reduction in liver function. This is liver damage that can be treated before it reaches the later serious stage of decompensated cirrhosis and complications, which can lead to liver cancer.\n\nWhat is compensated cirrhosis?\nThe liver is an internal organ that plays an extremely important role because of its function of filtering toxins to help clean the blood as well as the role of synthesizing nutrients. In cases where liver tissue is damaged, scar tissue will be left behind. This is cirrhosis of the liver. The more severe the cirrhosis, the more scar tissue there is, reducing liver function.\nThe degree of liver damage can be divided from mild to severe as follows:\nLow; Mild to moderate damage (fibrosis); Moderate to severe damage (fibrosis to compensated cirrhosis); Severe damage to liver failure (decompensated cirrhosis)\nThus, compensated cirrhosis is the stage of moderate liver damage. At this time, healthy liver cells can still function to \"compensate\" for damaged cells, so the normal function of the liver is basically maintained.(1)\nIf detected in time, the patient can be treated and restored to his original health. On the contrary, in cases where the causes of damage such as hepatitis virus infection, alcohol abuse, drug use... are not eliminated, liver damage will continue to progress and seriously impair liver function. than.\nAt compensated cirrhosis, healthy liver cells also have the ability to \"compensate\" for damaged cells.\n\nSymptoms of cirrhosis are compensated\nBecause it is in the early stages, the symptoms of compensated cirrhosis are almost unclear, difficult to recognize or easily confused with other diseases. However, patients may feel abnormalities such as:\nLoss of appetite, loss of appetite; Fatigue, not alert; Itching, skin bruising; Mild edema in legs; Occasionally there is a feeling of pressure in the right lower quadrant; Urine is darker yellow; There may be nosebleeds of unknown cause; Reduced sexual ability, irregular menstruation; Star-shaped capillaries appear on the back, chest, neck, and abdomen\nBoth decompensated and compensated cirrhosis can lead to liver cancer if not treated properly. In addition, cirrhosis can only be completely cured in the early stages. Therefore, patients should see a doctor immediately when detecting the above abnormalities.\n\nWhat causes compensated cirrhosis?\nThere are many causes that can lead to compensated cirrhosis. Among them, people with the following health problems may increase the risk of disease onset:\nHave underlying diseases such as hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D virus that are not well controlled; People with fatty liver disease; People who are overweight or obese; People who often abuse alcohol; Having an inadequate diet, too much fried food... affects liver function; Regular exposure to toxic substances such as arsenic, arsenic, etc. promotes the development of cirrhosis; Family history of liver diseases (2)\nAlcohol abuse is one of the reasons for compensated cirrhosis\n\nHow is compensated cirrhosis diagnosed?\nCompensated cirrhosis often has no obvious symptoms. Therefore, at this stage, if you want to detect the disease, in addition to clinical diagnosis, the doctor will prescribe a number of necessary tests such as:\n1. Liver biochemical test\nBiochemistry tests are aimed at checking the indicators of albumin, blood clotting, bilirubin, liver enzymes, etc., thereby diagnosing the health of the liver, determining whether the patient has compensated cirrhosis or another liver disease. Any other liver?\n2. Ultrasound and measurement of liver stiffness (liver elastography)\nWhen the liver has fibrosis and cirrhosis, it will become harder and no longer soft as usual. Measuring liver elasticity or fibrosis helps detect compensated cirrhosis. Liver ultrasound shows indirect images of the liver such as: irregular liver edges, intermittent veins, enlarged spleen... In addition, liver ultrasound also helps detect liver tumors caused by liver cancer in patients with cirrhosis.\n3. Liver biopsy\nThis way of diagnosing compensated cirrhosis is done by taking a few small tissue samples from the liver parenchyma for tests. This method today is mainly only performed in cases of compensated cirrhosis without clear cause.\n\nDoes compensated cirrhosis have complications?\nCirrhosis is considered the final stage of chronic liver diseases. For this reason, even if the patient has compensated cirrhosis, the patient should not be subjective. Most cases have no complications. However, if the disease is allowed to progress to the next stage - decompensated cirrhosis - serious health problems such as ascites, jaundice, and gastrointestinal bleeding due to ruptured varices of the esophagus and stomach can occur. thickening or hepatic encephalopathy.\n\nTreatment of compensated cirrhosis\nCan compensated cirrhosis be cured?\nCompensated cirrhosis can be treated. Based on the test results, it is possible to know the progression of cirrhosis through stages, and then have appropriate treatment. Treating compensated cirrhosis is also a way to prevent the disease from turning into decompensated cirrhosis. And in any disease, following your doctor's orders is always the top priority.\nInternal medical methods are the main treatment for patients with compensated hepatitis, including: treating the cause if viral hepatitis B, C, D, eliminating liver-damaging agents (alcohol, tobacco, toxic substances,…); Build a healthy diet and rest, get enough nutrients, and limit salt. In addition, there are a number of drugs that can be used when the disease is in the early stages such as diuretics, anti-constipation drugs or anti-fibrotic drugs such as corticoids, colchicine, etc. (3)\n\nMeasures to prevent compensated cirrhosis\nPrevention of compensated cirrhosis depends on lifestyle changes, controlling underlying diseases as well as complying with treatment from your doctor. To prevent the disease from getting worse, patients need to pay attention to some important things such as:\nAbstain completely from the use of beer or alcoholic beverages; Weight management; Lose weight if you are overweight/obese; Consider taking medication to avoid drug-induced liver toxicity; Avoid taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; Control and treat diabetes and dyslipidemia; Treat the root cause of liver disease; Build a diet rich in green vegetables and fruits; reduce intake of fats and lean protein sources; Fully vaccinated to limit the risk of acute liver injury caused by the virus; Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma\nVegetables and fruits are an ingredient that should not be overlooked in the diet for people with hepatitis\n\nCompensated or decompensated cirrhosis, which is more dangerous?\nAs the \"front\" stage, compensated cirrhosis is less dangerous than decompensated cirrhosis; However, both have the risk of becoming liver cancer. Patients often have no symptoms and have an average survival time of 12 years or more. Meanwhile, decompensated cirrhosis has a significant risk of complications - once there is at least one complication, the remaining life time will decrease sharply to an average of 2-5 years. When treated, patients' lives are greatly prolonged\nCenter for Endoscopy and Gastrointestinal Surgery (Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City) and Department of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreatic (Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing High-end, effective examination and treatment services for patients with mild to severe liver problems (Chronic viral hepatitis, fatty liver, acute hepatitis, chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, cancer). liver cancer...). Tam Anh General Hospital system brings together a team of highly specialized and experienced Internal Medicine - Surgery - Gastrointestinal Endoscopy doctors, in addition to the support of a modern medical equipment system imported from abroad. in addition, serving the maximum examination and treatment needs of customers.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of liver diseases with gastroenterology specialists of Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nCompensated cirrhosis is the level of cirrhosis that can be treated; This is the stage where if treated well, the liver still has a chance to recover. It is important that patients detect the disease early and make positive changes in lifestyle, eating, and exercise.",
