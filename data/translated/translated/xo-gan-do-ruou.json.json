    "content": "Alcoholic cirrhosis: Symptoms, treatment and prevention\n\nAlcoholic cirrhosis is the most severe complication of alcoholic liver diseases. If not treated promptly, the disease can develop into liver failure. At that time, liver transplantation is the only method of treatment.\n\nWhat is alcoholic cirrhosis?\nDoctor Vu Truong Khanh, Head of the Department of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreas at Tam Anh General Hospital in Hanoi, said that alcoholic cirrhosis is a condition of long-term chronic liver damage caused by drinking alcohol. This is the most dangerous alcohol-related liver disease, occurring after a long period of drinking too much alcohol. Scar tissue forms from alcohol damage and grows silently, gradually taking up all the living space of healthy cells in the liver. Over time, the liver loses its ability to regenerate itself, detoxify, and does not create enough protein for the body. However, if the patient detects early and stops drinking alcohol, liver function can still be maintained well.\n\nWhy does drinking too much alcohol cause cirrhosis?\nEthanol in beer and wine is essentially non-toxic, but when it enters the liver, it is converted into Acetaldehyde, which is toxic, so if you drink a lot of beer or alcohol, no matter what type, it will be toxic to the liver. The consequence from hepatitis to cirrhosis is the appearance of scars in liver tissue, leading to impaired liver function.(1)\nDevelopment of alcoholic cirrhosis.\n\nWhat is the risk of cirrhosis due to drinking alcohol?\nAccording to statistics, about 10 - 20% of people with cirrhosis are due to heavy alcohol abuse. The disease develops through 3 stages:\nFatty liver: Fat accumulation in liver cells, causing liver enlargement. This is the most common liver condition caused by alcohol.; Alcoholic hepatitis: Is an acute or chronic inflammatory condition in which liver cells die, leaving permanent scars.; Alcoholic cirrhosis: Normal liver tissue is destroyed, the liver becomes hard, swollen and functionally impaired.(2)\n\nSymptoms of alcoholic cirrhosis\nBefore the first symptoms appear, the liver may have been functioning abnormally for a long time. Symptoms of alcoholic cirrhosis often develop in people over the age of 50 and depend on the time they started drinking alcohol and how much they drank. As follows:\n1. Fatty liver stage\nThis is the first stage of alcoholic cirrhosis. The disease often has no major symptoms, so the patient feels subjective and continues to drink alcohol. At this time, the accumulation of fat inside liver cells will cause the liver to bulge, which can also cause mild pressure in the right lower quadrant. Patients may also feel tired, lose appetite...(4)\n2. Alcoholic hepatitis\nWhen alcohol abuse causes inflammation (swelling) of the liver, it will lead to symptoms such as:; Severe pain in the liver area; Sometimes there is a mild fever; Tired; Nausea and vomiting; Loss of appetite; Yellow urine, possibly jaundice and yellow sclera of the eyes\n3. Alcoholic cirrhosis\nThis is the most severe stage, the liver has been damaged and cannot recover. Symptoms of alcoholic cirrhosis now include:\nPortal hypertension; An enlarged spleen can cause pressure in the left lower quadrant; Malnutrition; Gastrointestinal bleeding such as vomiting blood, black stools; Ascites; CKD; Confusion (hepatic encephalopathy); Liver Cancer\nIn addition, alcoholic cirrhosis can also cause signs such as: Easy bruising, red spots on the palms, poor concentration...\n\nDangerous complications of alcoholic cirrhosis\nDr. Khanh recommends that alcoholic cirrhosis not only impairs important functions of the liver (detoxification, metabolism, blood clotting...) but also leads to many dangerous complications such as:\nJaundice, one of the complications that can occur in people with alcoholic cirrhosis.\nYellow skin, yellow eyes; Loss of muscle tone (muscle atrophy); Gastrointestinal bleeding: Due to ruptured esophageal or gastric varices. This complication is a consequence of portal hypertension due to alcoholic cirrhosis; Ascitic fluid infection: Occurs when the abdominal fluid becomes infected; Multimembrane effusion: pleural, pericardial; Hepatic encephalopathy (severe, hepatic coma): When liver function declines, causing accumulation of toxins and other metabolic intermediates in the blood, the brain and central nervous system will be damaged; Hepatorenal syndrome, liver cancer...\nThese complications not only cause economic costs and difficulties in the care and treatment process, but are also dangerous to the patient's life.\n\nDiagnosis of alcoholic cirrhosis\nThe first step in diagnosing alcoholic cirrhosis is a clinical examination, understanding the patient's medical history and living habits... After that, the patient will be assigned to diagnose alcoholic cirrhosis through tests. Other clinical trials such as:\nBlood tests: Including blood formula tests, electrolyte tests, assessment of blood clotting levels, liver function tests, etc.; Blood tests: Including blood formula tests, electrolyte tests, assessment of blood clotting levels, liver function tests, etc.\nLiver enzyme test: To determine the concentration of three types of gamma liver enzymes - glutamyltransferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). In people with alcoholic cirrhosis, AST is twice as high as ALT; Liver enzyme test: To determine the concentration of three types of gamma liver enzymes - glutamyltransferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). In people with alcoholic cirrhosis, AST is twice as high as ALT\nLiver ultrasound and liver elasticity measurements help assess the degree of fibrosis of the liver and abdomen; Liver ultrasound and liver elasticity measurements help assess the degree of fibrosis of the liver and abdomen\nCT scan, MRI: These are diagnostic imaging techniques, providing detailed images of liver condition, thereby assessing the level of liver damage; CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging MRI: These are diagnostic imaging techniques that provide detailed images of liver condition, thereby assessing the level of liver damage.\nLiver biopsy is rarely used today (3); Liver biopsy is rarely used today (3)\nUpper digestive endoscopy to detect varices of the esophagus and stomach; Upper digestive endoscopy to detect varices of the esophagus and stomach\n\nHow to treat cirrhosis caused by alcohol\nThe two main goals in treating alcoholic cirrhosis are: helping patients quit drinking and improving liver health.\n1. Limit alcohol intake\nLimiting alcohol is an important factor in treating alcoholic cirrhosis.\nLimiting alcohol is a prerequisite in the treatment of alcoholic cirrhosis. This helps support treatment and prevent severe disease progression. For heavy drinkers, stopping drinking suddenly will lead to problems such as anxiety, fatigue, headaches, nausea, agitation... At this time, the patient will be prescribed medication and intravenous fluids. pulse or sedatives until alcohol detox is complete. Normally, patients will feel positive improvements after about 3 months of reducing alcohol.\n2. Supportive care (eating and living habits)\nLong-term alcoholics often have malnutrition due to lack of calories, protein, vitamins and minerals, so these nutrients need to be supplemented through diet. Milk is a good product full of nutrients, suitable for people with cirrhosis.\n\nCan patients recover from alcoholic cirrhosis?\nOnce alcoholic cirrhosis occurs, the patient's liver tissue cannot restore to its original state. Treatment methods and changes in living habits can only prevent the disease from continuing to develop and reduce the risk of complications. In mild cases, if well controlled, people with alcoholic cirrhosis can enjoy life like normal people.\nDepartment of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreas (Tam Anh General Hospital Hanoi) and Department of Gastroenterology (Tam Anh General Hospital Ho Chi Minh City) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing examination and treatment services. High quality, effective for patients with mild to severe liver problems (fatty liver, acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer...).\nTam Anh General Hospital system brings together a team of highly specialized and experienced Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary, Internal Medicine - Surgery - Gastrointestinal Endoscopy doctors, in addition to the support of the current medical equipment system. modern, imported from abroad, serving the maximum examination and treatment needs of customers. Through modern medical equipment such as the EVIS Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, ultrasound machine with Aixplorer Mach 30 tissue elasticity..., patients can detect early-stage gastrointestinal cancer such as esophageal and stomach cancer and detect colon polyps; Management and treatment of chronic liver disease including hepatitis B virus to detect liver cancer at an early stage.\nAlthough alcoholic cirrhosis can be prevented and controlled if detected promptly. But it's best for patients to limit alcohol, which is not only beneficial for the liver but also good for overall health.",
