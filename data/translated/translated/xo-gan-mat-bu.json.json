    "content": "Decompensated cirrhosis: Causes, symptoms and treatment\n\nDecompensated cirrhosis is an emergency that requires immediate medical treatment to avoid potentially life-threatening complications. The condition comes from many different causes, recognized through a number of clear symptoms. For this pathological problem, early monitoring, diagnosis and treatment is really important.\n\nWhat is decompensated cirrhosis?\nChronic liver disease will lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis has two stages, the first stage is compensated and the second stage is decompensated cirrhosis. Decompensated cirrhosis is a severe progression of cirrhosis; compensated cirrhosis often has no or atypical symptoms. Decompensated cirrhosis is characterized by signs: jaundice, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and bleeding due to variceal rupture. With compensated cirrhosis, the patient often does not notice any symptoms because the organs still function normally. On the contrary, when progressing to the decompensated stage, serious liver function and complications can occur.\nFor this condition, the patient requires immediate medical care and treatment with a prolonged hospital stay. In addition, decompensated cirrhosis has a high risk of death, up to 20-50% depending on the type of complications. Therefore, early monitoring, detection and treatment is really important.\n\nCause of decompensated cirrhosis\nDecompensated cirrhosis is a severe stage of cirrhosis. This condition occurs when organ scarring has become severe, interfering with normal function. Any damage to the liver can lead to scarring, eventually progressing to decompensated cirrhosis. Some of the most typical causes include:\nDrinking a lot of beer and wine for a long time; Chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C; Accumulation of fat in the liver.; Accumulation of iron in the liver; Accumulation of copper in the liver; Bile ducts do not function normally; Autoimmune liver disease.; Biliary tract damage; Side effects of certain medications, such as Methotrexate.\n\nSymptoms of decompensated cirrhosis\nIn the early stages, cirrhosis usually does not cause any symptoms. However, when decompensated cirrhosis progresses, patients can recognize it through some of the following typical signs: (1)\nJaundice.; Tired.; Weight loss.; Bleeds and bruises easily.; Ascites (abdominal bloating due to fluid accumulation).; Swollen legs due to fluid retention; Confusion, slurred speech or drowsiness; Nausea.; Anorexia; Red palm.; Testicles are shrunk; Unusual itching; Varicose vein.\n\nDiagnosis of decompensated cirrhosis\nTypically, doctors will diagnose decompensated cirrhosis when the patient begins to have symptoms such as jaundice or mental confusion. Before that, some test questions will be asked including:(2)\nSpecific symptoms.; History of previous liver disease; Complications of liver disease.; Previous endoscopy.; Serious symptoms (if any): infection, fever, difficulty urinating, difficulty breathing, cough, joint pain or swelling, rash.; Bowel habits: black stools...; Recent foreign travel.; Symptoms of abdominal pain or unusual swelling; Drinking habits from before to the time of examination; Medications currently in use.\nBelow are some commonly used diagnostic methods for decompensated cirrhosis:\nBlood tests: Blood formula tests may show decreased platelets, decreased coagulation tests such as decreased prothrombin, decreased blood albumin; Blood tests: Blood formula tests may show decreased platelets, decreased coagulation tests such as decreased prothrombin, decreased blood albumin\nUltrasound shows fluid in the abdomen, cirrhosis of the liver, dilated portal vein, enlarged spleen, and can see tumors when there are complications of liver cancer; Ultrasound shows fluid in the abdomen, cirrhosis of the liver, dilated portal vein, enlarged spleen, and tumors can be seen when there are complications of liver cancer.\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy: there are varicose veins in the esophagus and veins in the stomach. All patients with cirrhosis require endoscopy to prevent bleeding from ruptured esophageal varices; Esophagogastroduodenoscopy: there are varicose veins in the esophagus and veins in the stomach. All patients with cirrhosis require endoscopy to prevent bleeding from ruptured esophageal varices\n\nComplications of decompensated cirrhosis\nDecompensated cirrhosis is a case that requires urgent emergency care, intensive care and sometimes direct transfer of the patient to liver transplantation. If the disease is not treated promptly, it can lead to a series of serious complications, thereby increasing the risk of death, including:\nBleeding due to ruptured varices: esophagus, stomach or duodenum. Rarely due to rupture of dilated tufts in the small intestine or colorectum; Ascites.; Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; Hepatic encephalopathy.\n\nHow to treat decompensated cirrhosis\nDecompensated cirrhosis is a complex disorder that affects many systems in the body, requiring a specialized approach for optimal management from the moment the patient is hospitalized. This condition has many different treatment options, but in the late stages, liver transplantation is always the preferred option.\nAccordingly, the transplant process is performed with part or all of the organ from the donor. Liver tissue can regenerate, so patients can receive a liver from a living donor. Then, both the transplanted liver and the donor liver regenerate within a few months.\nTreatment:\nEvery day, patients need to weigh themselves to know if they have fluid retention in cirrhosis; Treat the cause if any: specific drug treatment for hepatitis B and C viruses, stop drinking alcohol...; Symptomatic treatment: Take diuretics when there is edema or ascites; Prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding due to ruptured varicose veins\n\nPrevention of decompensated cirrhosis\nThe most effective prevention measure for chronic liver diseases, including decompensated cirrhosis, is to eliminate or neutralize the cause of persistent liver damage. Successful suppression of the root cause can prevent or at least slow down the serious progression of the disease.(3)\nThis is especially true in compensated cirrhosis. Specifically, eliminating the pathogen often effectively prevents decompensation while reducing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and prolonging survival. Some useful solutions that patients should note are as follows:\nCompletely abstain from alcohol; Manage weight appropriately, avoid overweight and obesity; Use medicine, choose medicine carefully to avoid causing liver toxicity; Avoid taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).; Vaccination to avoid acute viral injury; Control diabetes.; Have safe sex.; Build a healthy diet with foods rich in fiber (vegetables, fruits), beneficial fats from vegetable oils, fish, nuts...; Maintain a regular exercise routine.; Check the liver regularly to detect abnormal damage early, and then apply timely treatment.\nDepartment of Gastroenterology (Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City) and Department of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreatic (Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi) are prestigious medical centers specializing in Gastroenterology, providing high-quality examination and treatment services. Acute and effective for patients with mild to severe liver problems (fatty liver, acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer...). Tam Anh General Hospital system brings together a team of highly specialized and experienced Internal Medicine - Surgery - Gastrointestinal Endoscopy doctors, in addition to the support of a modern medical equipment system imported from abroad. in addition, serving the maximum examination and treatment needs of customers.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of liver diseases with gastroenterology specialists of Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nAbove is a summary of all information related to decompensated cirrhosis. Hopefully through these shares, patients will have more useful updates to proactively monitor, detect and treat the disease effectively.",
