    "content": "Coronary atherosclerosis: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment\n\nThe left and right coronary arteries are arteries that arise from the left and right coronary sinus in the root of the aorta, just above the aortic valve. The left coronary artery begins as a common trunk artery and quickly divides into the anterior interventricular artery and the purulent artery. The left and right coronary arteries are responsible for supplying blood to the heart. When coronary atherosclerosis occurs, the risk of coronary artery disease increases and when the atherosclerotic plaque in the artery wall becomes ulcerated and cracked on the surface, leading to the aggregation of platelets and clotting factors. , forming blood clots - the cause of an extremely dangerous myocardial infarction.\n \nThe process of coronary atherosclerosis takes place over many years, gradually narrowing the vessel lumen and causing coronary artery blockage if there is no timely intervention.\n\nWhat is coronary atherosclerosis?\nCoronary atherosclerosis or coronary atherosclerosis occurs when plaque builds up on the inside walls of the arteries, causing the arteries to become stiff and narrow. Plaque is a sticky substance made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium and other substances. (first)\nWhen atherosclerotic plaque appears on the inside wall of the coronary artery, it will cause narrowing of the coronary artery, leading to myocardial ischemia. If not detected and given appropriate treatment, the patient will face dangerous health problems such as heart attack and even sudden death.\n\nCause of coronary atherosclerosis\nWhen the density of LDL - Cholesterol or \"bad\" cholesterol - is too high for the body to eliminate completely, it will gradually accumulate in the coronary artery walls. At this time, the body sends a \"crew\" including white blood cells and other cells to the site of poisoning to handle the damage. Over the years, cholesterol continues to accumulate in the coronary arteries, and the body's reaction to it creates plaque. It is this plaque that narrows the blood vessels, obstructing blood flow and causing disease. (2)\nThe following factors contribute to increased risk of coronary atherosclerosis:\nSmoke; High bad cholesterol (LDL-C); Overweight – obesity; Lack of physical activity; Hypertension; Diabetes\n\nCommon symptoms\nCoronary atherosclerosis usually does not cause any symptoms until the artery is severely narrowed or completely blocked. Many people don't even know they have the disease until they receive medical attention from an emergency, such as a heart attack or stroke.\nYou may feel symptoms if your coronary arteries are more than 70% blocked. This blockage causes blood flow to the heart to slow, resulting in the heart not getting enough blood.\nPatients need regular examinations to control the condition and receive timely intervention.\nSome early warning signs of atherosclerosis include:\nChest pain (angina) when exercising or doing heavy exertion. This pain usually stops when you rest; Shortness of breath; More tired than usual\nIf a coronary artery is blocked by a blood clot, you may face a heart attack with symptoms such as:\nSevere chest tightness; Pain in one or both arms spreading to the shoulder; Discomfort in the neck or jaw; Nausea and vomiting; Heart beats fast; Sweat; Dizziness or fainting\nWhen any signs of coronary atherosclerosis appear, or you have one of the risk factors for the disease, you need to go to the hospital for early examination for timely diagnosis and treatment.\n\nComplications of coronary atherosclerosis\nAtherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries can potentially lead to the following complications: (3)\nThickening, narrowing the vessel lumen and blocking blood flow in the coronary artery. This process in its early stages usually does not cause any symptoms.; When arteries become very clogged, patients may experience stable angina. This is chest pain that often occurs during activity and disappears when resting. Although it is not a heart attack, it is a sign that you are at risk of a heart attack and need to be treated aggressively with medication.\nThe plaque ruptures, causing a blood clot to form inside the coronary artery. Then, 2 cases occur:\nThe blood clot does not completely block the blood vessel. It will disappear without causing a heart attack.; Coronary arteries become clogged with blood clots, starving the heart muscle of nutrients and oxygen to the point where it cannot restore function.; Blood clots can form in any artery of the heart, including those that are only mildly clogged.\n\nDiagnostic method\nTo determine whether you have atherosclerosis, your doctor will first learn about your family and personal medical history and your risk factors for atherosclerosis. Next, the doctor conducts a comprehensive examination. (4)\nYou will be prescribed blood tests to determine cholesterol index, blood sugar, liver function and kidney function.\nBesides, your doctor may ask you to conduct laboratory tests. This will help your doctor create the best treatment plan for you. Clinical tests that help diagnose coronary atherosclerosis include:\nEchocardiogram: gives clear images of the heart's valves and chambers, and evaluates how well your heart is pumping blood.; Electrocardiogram (EKG): measures electrical activity and heart rate; Exercise tests such as carpet exercise testing, bicycle stress echocardiography or drug stress echocardiography: help evaluate areas of ischemic myocardium, from which the affected coronary arteries can be located. damage.; Coronary MSCT angiography or coronary angiography with cardiac catheterization: detects the degree of blockage in the coronary arteries and can intervene to place stents when necessary.\nBicycle stress echocardiography helps evaluate myocardial ischemia during physical activity\n\nTreatment of coronary atherosclerosis\nAccording to MSc. Pham Do Anh Thu, the goals in treating coronary atherosclerosis include:\nSlows or prevents plaque buildup in coronary artery walls; Symptom improvement; Prevent complications such as platelet aggregation causing blood clots, coronary artery stenosis, myocardial infarction...; Helps blood circulate better by expanding coronary arteries, overcoming blockages\nEffective methods for treating coronary atherosclerosis include lifestyle changes, medications, and procedures or surgery. Depending on the condition of atherosclerosis and the risk of potential complications, your doctor will give you the best solution.\nMaintaining a healthy lifestyle is important for controlling coronary atherosclerosis so that symptoms do not get worse over time. Patients need:\nQuit smoking because cigarette smoke damages artery walls and reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood.; Change your diet: limit foods rich in bad cholesterol such as processed foods, fried foods, fast foods...; Limit foods high in salt and sugar; Increase intake of good starches, good fats and fiber; Reduce stress: Stress increases blood pressure. Therefore, controlling stress means maintaining blood pressure at a healthy level.; Exercise regularly.\nDrugs prescribed in the treatment of coronary atherosclerosis have the following effects:\nControl blood pressure; Reduce bad cholesterol; Manage blood sugar levels; Prevents platelet aggregation that causes blood clots\nSome cases of advanced atherosclerosis may require procedures/surgery, such as:\nCoronary artery angioplasty or stenting; Coronary artery bypass surgery\n\nPrecautions\nAlthough you cannot completely prevent coronary atherosclerosis, you can reduce your risk of the disease by:\nHave a healthy diet.; Regular physical activity: start with short walks and increase intensity to 30 minutes per day on most days of the week.; Maintain a reasonable weight.; Control other health problems, especially diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol.; No smoking.; Regularly check your heart health.\nIncreasing exercise for at least 30 minutes a day helps slow down the progression of atherosclerosis.\nEquipped with a modern machinery system, the Cardiovascular Center of Tam Anh General Hospital is a reliable address in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Patients examined here will receive an echocardiogram with a 4D ultrasound machine, a 768-slice coronary CT angiogram, a carotid Doppler ultrasound, a 12-lead electrocardiogram, a rolling carpet exercise test, a bicycle, etc. From there, detect the disease early for timely intervention. A team of experienced experts will advise on appropriate treatment, prevent disease progression and help patients recover early, avoiding future complications.\nWith early diagnosis and treatment, people with coronary atherosclerosis can maintain healthy and active lives. However, the potential risks of this disease should not be ignored, the most dangerous of which are coronary artery blockage and myocardial infarction. To minimize risks, you need to follow your doctor's instructions on the treatment regimen, lead a scientific lifestyle and go for follow-up appointments on time.",
