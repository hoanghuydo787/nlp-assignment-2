    "content": "Testicular torsion: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment\n\nTesticular torsion is a surgical emergency and needs to be treated promptly to avoid necrotic complications that require orchiectomy. The disease appears with symptoms of severe and sudden pain in the scrotum. In almost all cases, surgical intervention is the most appropriate treatment option.\n\nWhat disease is testicular torsion?\nTesticular torsion is a phenomenon in which the spermatic cord is twisted, blocking the path of blood transport to the testicles, thereby reducing blood flow, causing sudden and intense pain and swelling. This condition can occur at any age, most commonly in infants and between 12 and 18 years old. A twisted testicle requires emergency surgical intervention to avoid serious damage, leading to amputation. (first)\nIn terms of pathophysiology, this condition occurs when there is mechanical twisting of the spermatic cord, causing the testicles to hang in the scrotum in an abnormal position containing arteries and veins. Twisting will reduce or completely block blood flow to the organ. The degree of arterial and venous obstruction will depend on the duration and severity of the torsion.\nUsually, venous blood flow is compromised first. The increase in venous pressure then further reduces arterial blood flow. This leads to a decrease in the amount of oxygen supplied to the testicles, which, if not treated promptly, will lead to serious damage.\nMany studies also show that torsion can occur even during fetal development. This is one of the reasons why children are born with testicular deformities (only one testicle).\n\nCauses of testicular torsion\nCurrently, the cause of testicular torsion has not been accurately determined. Some factors that can be mentioned include: (2)\nGenetic factors: Most men experiencing this condition are related to genetic factors, in which both testicles can be affected.; Trauma: Testicular torsion often occurs a few hours after vigorous activity, minor trauma, or even during sleep.; Temperature too low.; Rapid growth of the testicles during puberty.\n\nSigns of testicular torsion\nWhen the blood transport route to the scrotum is cut off, the twisted testicle can cause severe urticaria. The organ is swollen and at risk of rapid necrosis if not treated promptly. Below are some typical signs that men should monitor and recognize to contact a doctor early: (3)\nSudden and severe pain on one side of the scrotum; Redness and swelling of the scrotum; One testicle is higher than the other; Stomach-ache.; Nausea and vomiting.; Fever.; Frequent urination; Dizzy.; An unusual tumor appears in the scrotum.\n\nRisk factors that increase the risk of testicular torsion\nMost people with testicular torsion have no underlying health problems. However, research shows that several risk factors may increase your risk of experiencing this condition, including: (4)\nA testicle that is larger in size.; Tumors appearing on the testicles, especially malignant tumors involving the spermatic cord.; Age: Testicular torsion often occurs in infants and adolescents between 16 and 18 years old (before or during puberty).; Certain congenital malformations or anatomical variations in the testicles or surrounding structures can also increase the risk of torsion, typically the “bell-clapper” deformity, which accounts for up to 90%. total number of cases.; Scrotal injury or heavy exercise, such as cycling (only about 4 - 8% of all cases).; Genetic.; Cold weather (still under research).\n\nIs testicular torsion dangerous?\nTesticular torsion is an emergency condition. If not treated promptly, it can lead to many serious complications as follows:\nSevere testicular damage: Twisted testicles are at risk of serious damage due to reduced blood flow and lack of oxygen and nutrient supply to the organ. In case of necessity, the testicle must be removed to avoid widespread necrosis or tissue death.; Infertility: The impact of testicular torsion on long-term fertility is not yet fully understood. However, this phenomenon has the risk of affecting sperm quality, especially in adolescents and adults.; Causes damage to the remaining testicle: After one testicle is damaged, the body's immune system will be activated to clean up and heal. During this process, antibodies or proteins will be produced, potentially causing damage to the remaining testicle.; Reperfusion injury: This type of injury often occurs in tissues that have been deprived of blood supply for a long period of time.; Sepsis: In extremely rare cases (0.03%), if prolonged untreated testicular torsion can lead to sepsis, a serious and widespread infection that causes blood damage, neighboring organs, even death.\n\nHow is testicular torsion diagnosed?\nFor testicular torsion, the doctor will start by checking the level of swelling and pain in the scrotum. Specifically, a pinch on the inside of the thigh will be performed to cause the organ to contract. In case this reflex does not occur, it is likely that the testicle is twisted. In addition, some tests that may also be ordered include: (5)\nScrotal Doppler ultrasound to check blood flow to the testicles.; Testicular scintigraphy (rare)\n\nTreatment of testicular torsion\nTesticular torsion is a surgical emergency, you should contact your doctor immediately when experiencing acute scrotal pain. Typical symptoms are sudden sharp pain. However, many patients will experience intermittent torsion, which means severe pain that then subsides. The possibility of recurrence is high so early treatment is needed; In particular, surgery is always the number one priority option in treating testicular torsion. Surgery needs to be performed as quickly as possible to restore blood flow to the scrotum. If blood flow is stopped for more than 6 hours, testicular tissue has a high risk of dying. The affected testicle must then be removed.; Untwisting surgery is performed under general anesthesia. The doctor will make a small incision in the scrotum, then remove the twist. Small stitches will fix the testicle in place in the scrotum, preventing torsion from happening again.\n\nMonitor treatment and prognosis of testicular torsion\nAccording to research, 90% of cases treated for testicular torsion within 4-6 hours of pain onset do not require orchiectomy. However, if this process is performed after 24 hours or more, 90% of the testicles are at risk of being removed.; Orchiectomy can affect hormone production in the newborn and future fertility due to reduced sperm count. If the body begins to create antibodies due to torsion, sperm mobility is also at risk of being limited.; Therefore, to avoid serious complications, men should seek emergency medical care immediately if they suspect testicular torsion. The rate of successful surgery will be higher if detected early.\n\nMethods to prevent testicular torsion\nThere is currently no method for early prevention of testicular torsion.; Rarely, torsion occurs on both sides. If doctors remove one testicle, the remaining testicle is still capable of producing enough sperm to conceive. However, people who have had testicular torsion will often have lower than normal sperm counts.; Sometimes, the remaining testicle will grow larger than the balance. Therefore, men should consider wearing protective clothing when exercising and playing sports to protect their organs from unnecessary injury.\nCenter for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology - Urology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts, Internal Medicine and Surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.

Diagnosis - medical and surgical treatment of all diseases.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Center for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology - Urology, Tam Anh General Hospital System, you can make an appointment online through the following ways:\nAbove is a summary of all useful information about testicular torsion.
