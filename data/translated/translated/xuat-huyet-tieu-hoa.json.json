    "content": "Gastrointestinal bleeding: Causes, symptoms, treatment, prevention\n\nGastrointestinal bleeding can be a warning sign of a potentially dangerous condition, such as stomach cancer, colorectal cancer...\n\nWhat is gastrointestinal bleeding?\nGastrointestinal bleeding is a symptom in the digestive tract including the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, duodenum, large intestine or colon, rectum, anus bleeding due to a certain injury.(1 )\nBleeding can occur in any organ in the digestive tract. If bleeding occurs in the esophagus, stomach, or the first part of the small intestine (duodenum), it is called upper gastrointestinal bleeding. If the bleeding is in the lower part of the small intestine, large intestine, rectum or anus, it is called lower gastrointestinal bleeding.\nAccording to Dr. Hoang Dinh Thanh, Center for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Surgery, Tam Anh General Hospital, gastrointestinal bleeding should be recognized as a serious disease because it is related to many potential problems. worrying, especially digestive cancers.\nHaving blood after bowel movements can be a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding\n\nSymptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding\nGastrointestinal bleeding often has symptoms including:\nStool mixed with blood, dark stool Wipe blood on paper Vomiting blood Pale Dizziness Fatigue Chest pain Abdominal pain Sweating, weak limbs Low blood pressure, fainting if bleeding is severe; Bloody stools, dark stools; Wipe paper with blood on it; Vomiting blood; Haggard; Dizzy; Tired; Chest pain; Stomach-ache; Sweating, weak limbs; Low blood pressure, fainting if bleeding is severe\n\nCauses of gastrointestinal bleeding\nGastrointestinal bleeding can come from many causes. Among them, the causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding often include: (2)\nPeptic ulcer: This is the most common cause of upper (high) gastrointestinal bleeding. Stomach ulcers are sores that develop on the lining of the stomach and upper part of the small intestine. They are formed by stomach acid, bacteria, or by using anti-inflammatory drugs that damage the mucous layer. Mallory-Weiss syndrome: Characterized by bleeding due to tearing of the esophagus due to excessive and forceful vomiting and is most common in people who drink alcohol and vomit continuously. Esophageal varices: Esophageal varices can cause bleeding due to rupture of dilated veins. This condition often occurs in people with severe, end-stage cirrhosis. Esophagitis: Esophagitis is often caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). People with esophagitis are also likely to experience gastrointestinal bleeding.; Peptic ulcer: This is the most common cause of upper (high) gastrointestinal bleeding.

This condition often occurs in people with severe, end-stage cirrhosis.; Esophagitis: Esophagitis is often caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). People with esophagitis are also likely to experience gastrointestinal bleeding.\nCauses of lower (lower) gastrointestinal bleeding often include:\nDiverticulosis: The development of small, bulging sacs in the digestive tract forming diverticula. Diverticulitis can cause lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease... can both cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Tumors: Malignant or benign tumors or cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon or rectum can weaken the lining of the digestive tract and cause bleeding. Vascular dysplasia, vascular malformations. Causes massive bleeding, sometimes making it difficult to find the source. Hemorrhoids: These are swollen veins in the anus or lower rectum, similar to varicose veins and can cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Anal fissures: Anal fissures can also cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Proctitis: Inflammation of the rectal lining can cause rectal bleeding.; Diverticulosis: The development of small, bulging sacs in the digestive tract forming diverticula.

Gastrointestinal endoscopy: The doctor may prescribe a gastric endoscopy or a complete colonoscopy. Computed tomography angiography: Allows identification of a bleeding vessel; Blood tests: Such as blood formula, liver and kidney function and some tests to evaluate anemia.; Gastrointestinal endoscopy: The doctor may prescribe a gastric endoscopy or a complete colonoscopy.; Computed tomography angiography: Allows identification of a bleeding vessel.\nGastroscopy is one of the methods used to diagnose gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\nComplications of gastrointestinal bleeding\nGastrointestinal bleeding, if not treated early, can lead to many worrying complications. Such as:\nChronic anemia: Prolonged bleeding can lead to a lack of hemoglobin and red blood cells, causing chronic anemia syndrome. Symptoms of anemia syndrome include chest pain, dizziness, fatigue, weakness, headache, shortness of breath and mental clarity, poor concentration, and reduced work and study productivity.(4) ; Chronic anemia: Prolonged bleeding can lead to a lack of hemoglobin and red blood cells, causing chronic anemia syndrome. Symptoms of anemia syndrome include chest pain, dizziness, fatigue, weakness, headache, shortness of breath and mental clarity, poor concentration, and reduced work and study productivity.(4) ; Acute anemia: Severe blood loss can make it difficult for the heart to pump blood. Signs of acute blood loss include cold and blue skin and sweating; confusion or agitation; decreased urine output; rapid breathing and loss of consciousness; Acute anemia: Severe blood loss can make it difficult for the heart to pump blood. Signs of acute blood loss include cold and blue skin and sweating; confusion or agitation; decreased urine output; rapid breathing and loss of consciousness; Shock – Death: Acute bleeding can damage organs and cause organ failure. If left untreated, shock can cause irreversible damage or death. Signs and symptoms of shock include low, falling, or unmeasured blood pressure, bluish lips and fingernails, chest pain, confusion, dizziness, anxiety, pale skin, decreased or no urine output Yes, pulse is fast but weak, breathing is shallow and unconscious.; Shock – Death: Acute bleeding can damage organs and cause organ failure. If left untreated, shock can cause irreversible damage or lead to death. Signs and symptoms of shock include low, falling, or unmeasured blood pressure, bluish lips and fingernails, chest pain, confusion, dizziness, anxiety, pale skin, decreased or no urine output Yes, pulse is fast but weak, breathing is shallow and unconscious.\n\nTreatment of gastrointestinal bleeding\nIn the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding, mainly follow the principles of respiratory protection, fluid replacement, and blood transfusion (in case of heavy blood loss); combination of medication. Some cases require endoscopy or embolization.(3)\n1. Protect the respiratory tract\nUpper gastrointestinal bleeding can cause disability or death if blood is inhaled. To avoid this risk, patients with a poor gag reflex, coma or loss of consciousness or undergoing gastroscopy should be considered for endotracheal intubation for ventilation.\n2. Fluid replacement and blood transfusion\nPatients with hypotension or severe gastrointestinal bleeding need to be rehydrated intravenously as soon as possible. A large needle will be inserted into a blood vessel at the elbow to infuse fluid with an average capacity of 500-1000ml of saline and in children a maximum of 2 liters (20 ml/kg).\nIn addition, in cases of severe anemia, patients need blood transfusions. However, in cases of coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, the elderly, and children, blood transfusions should be given. Consider carefully to avoid complications.\n3. Medicine\nFor upper gastrointestinal bleeding, patients are treated with intravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).\nFor cases of gastrointestinal bleeding due to varicose veins in cirrhosis, patients should be given visceral vasoconstrictors. .\n4. Stop bleeding\nAbout 80% of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding can stop the bleeding on their own, but the remaining 20% ​​of cases require specific treatment. Treatment depends on the location of bleeding and should be initiated early to minimize the risk of death, especially in the elderly.\nMethods to stop bleeding often include:\nStomach ulcer, bleeding or recurrent bleeding: Endoscopic treatment to stop bleeding locally using many different means such as using electric heat, chemical embolization, vasoconstriction, clamping. In more difficult cases, bleeding may need to be stopped by embolization or surgery. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to varicose veins: Treatment is by ligation, sclerotherapy or surgery to connect the two portal venous systems (TIPS). Severe, prolonged lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to diverticular disease or vasodilation: Endoscopy with clips, hemostasis with heat, electrocautery or injection of diluted epinephrine to stop bleeding. If there are polyps, they can be removed. Partial colectomy may be used depending on the case. Hemorrhage due to acute or chronic internal hemorrhoids: Analoscopy can be used for surgery or rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy injection to stop bleeding.; Stomach ulcer, bleeding or recurrent bleeding: Endoscopic treatment to stop bleeding locally using many different means such as using electric heat, chemical embolization, vasoconstriction, clipping.; In more difficult cases, bleeding may need to be stopped by embolization or surgery.; Gastrointestinal bleeding due to varicose veins: Treatment is by ligation, sclerotherapy or surgery to connect the two portal vein systems (TIPS).; Severe, prolonged lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to diverticular disease or vasodilation: Endoscopy with clips, hemostasis with heat, electrocautery or injection of diluted epinephrine to stop bleeding.

Gentle exercise: Patients should only move gently when the wound has begun to stabilize; Do not move a lot or exercise vigorously. Diet: Patients should eat easy-to-digest foods such as soup, thin porridge, stewed soup, and drink milk; You should divide into many small meals during the day, avoid eating too much, causing pressure on the digestive tract.; Rest and recuperation: Patients need to take time to rest, recuperate, and avoid mental and physical stress; Gentle exercise: Patients should only move gently when the wound has begun to stabilize; Do not move a lot or exercise vigorously; Diet: Patients should eat easy-to-digest foods such as soup, thin porridge, stewed soup, and drink milk; You should divide into many small meals throughout the day to avoid overeating, which puts pressure on the digestive tract.\nPatients should eat easy-to-digest foods such as soup, thin porridge... for easy digestion\n\nMeasures to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding\nDepending on the cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, there will be different specific disease prevention instructions. However, the general recommendation is that people should:\nEat scientifically, with priority given to a diet rich in green vegetables and fiber (soluble and insoluble). Limit drinking alcohol, fast food (fried chicken, frozen meat...); Avoid eating spicy, hot, sour, salty foods that are harmful to the stomach, intestines or other foods that irritate the stomach. Maintaining an exercise regimen for at least 30 minutes a day helps bowel movements run smoothly. Eat cooked food and drink boiled food to avoid poisoning and parasitic infections that lead to gastrointestinal diseases that can cause bleeding. Do not eat too much or be too hungry, do not exercise vigorously or lie down immediately after eating to avoid the risk of stomach pain and gastroesophageal reflux. Maintain the habit of taking care of the digestive system to improve immunity by periodically deworming, supplementing digestive enzymes, collagen and vitamins...; Eat scientifically, with priority given to a diet rich in green vegetables and fiber (soluble and insoluble).; Limit drinking alcohol, fast food (fried chicken, frozen meat...); Avoid eating spicy, hot, sour, salty foods that are harmful to the stomach, intestines or other foods that irritate the stomach.; Maintaining an exercise regimen for at least 30 minutes a day helps bowel movements run smoothly.; Eat cooked food and drink boiled food to avoid poisoning and parasitic infections leading to gastrointestinal diseases that can cause bleeding.; Do not eat too much or be too hungry, do not exercise vigorously or lie down immediately after eating to avoid the risk of stomach pain and gastroesophageal reflux.; Maintain the habit of taking care of the digestive system to improve immunity by periodically deworming, supplementing digestive enzymes, collagen and vitamins...\n\nQuestions about gastrointestinal bleeding\n1. Is gastrointestinal bleeding dangerous?\nGastrointestinal bleeding is a condition with many potential risks such as the risk of choking on blood (if there is a lot of bleeding) which can cause brain death and rapid death. Gastrointestinal bleeding can also be a sign of a certain type of digestive cancer. Therefore, this is a dangerous condition, patients need to be examined and treated as soon as possible.\n2. Can gastrointestinal bleeding heal on its own?\nAs mentioned above, patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (high) can heal on their own within one to two weeks, depending on the severity. However, specific treatment interventions are needed to avoid complications or recurrence.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment for gastrointestinal bleeding with experienced experts of Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact: Tam Anh General Hospital System: Hanoi: 108 Hoang Nhu Next, Bo De Ward, Long Bien District, Hanoi City Hotline: 024 3872 3872 – 024 7106 6858“>024 3872 3872 – 024 7106 6858 HCMC: 2B Pho Quang, Ward 2, Tan Binh District, HCMC Hotline: 0287 102 6789 – 093 180 6858“>0287 102 6789 – 093 180 6858 Fanpage: Tam Anh General Hospital Website: https://tamanhhospital.vn\n3. After treatment, will gastrointestinal bleeding recur?\nGastrointestinal bleeding is very easy to recur, so after treatment, patients need to continue treatment, re-examine and carefully maintain their digestive tract to avoid recurrence.\nGastrointestinal bleeding should be considered a serious condition because it carries many worrying risks such as digestive cancer. Therefore, when there are signs of gastrointestinal bleeding such as bloody stools, black stools, bloody toilet paper, etc., patients should immediately go to the hospital for examination to detect potential problems early and receive timely treatment. . Currently, modern digestive endoscopy can help examine the digestive tract, detect lesions early and treat them. The earlier digestive diseases are treated, the more effective they are and vice versa, especially digestive cancers.",
