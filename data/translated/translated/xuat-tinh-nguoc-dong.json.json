If the urine contains sperm, the diagnosis will likely be retrograde ejaculation.\nIf the patient's post-orgasm urine does not contain semen, the patient may be experiencing some other problem or related to semen production. At this time, other specialists will assist in further examination to find the real cause.\n\nCan retrograde ejaculation be cured?\nUsually, retrograde ejaculation does not require treatment, if the disease does not affect fertility.\nIn case treatment is needed, the method and whether it is effective or not depends on the cause of the disease.\nDrug treatment\nUsing medication can be effective if the cause of retrograde ejaculation is due to nerve damage, effects from diabetes, multiple sclerosis, some bladder surgeries...\nThese medications help keep the bladder neck closed during ejaculation, but may cause side effects or adverse reactions with other medications.

With the advancement of current assisted reproductive technologies, patients can completely become fathers, even if they have retrograde ejaculation.\nDoctors will take many measures including taking sperm from the testicles, epididymis or even urine, processing it in the laboratory for in vitro fertilization and has been proven to be effective.
