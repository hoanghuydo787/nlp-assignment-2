    "content": "Premature ejaculation: Causes, signs and treatments\n\nPremature ejaculation is a fairly common phenomenon in men, about 30% of men in the world experience this phenomenon at least a few times in their lives. Premature ejaculation directly affects sexual pleasure, causing depression and low self-esteem. If this condition is not resolved soon, it will cause psychological fatigue, boredom and avoidance of sex, decreased fertility and many dangerous complications can occur.\n\nWhat is premature ejaculation?\nPremature ejaculation is an ejaculation disorder when a man cannot control the time of ejaculation. The process of premature ejaculation is calculated from the moment the penis enters the vagina and only lasts for 2 minutes. . Ejaculation is the release of semen from the penis when orgasm is achieved. Premature ejaculation not only affects one's own feelings in bed, but also affects one's \"partner\". Premature ejaculation is a fairly common phenomenon, appearing from ages 18 to 59. (1)\nPremature ejaculation is a quite sensitive issue, so many people do not dare to face it and avoid examination and treatment. However, this greatly affects men's lives. If not treated early, men are at risk of facing dangerous complications such as: erectile dysfunction, causing impotence, even leading to to infertility. Premature ejaculation usually has 4 types: primary (short ejaculation time that occurs right from the first time of intercourse and continues until the present), secondary (normal ejaculation time, but the time to cause this may vary). significantly reduces the effects and effects on psychology and couple relationships), premature ejaculation changes (ejaculation time changes depending on circumstances, partners, stimulation...) and ejaculation disorders similar to ejaculation. premature ejaculation.\nPremature ejaculation is a condition in which men cannot control the timing of ejaculation\n\nDegrees of premature ejaculation\nPremature ejaculation has many different levels of severity, depending on the man's ejaculation time to know the condition:\nMild level: Is ejaculation after only 1-2 minutes from when the penis enters the vagina.; Moderate level: There is ejaculation within a period of 30 seconds to 1 minute.; Severity: Men have ejaculation within 15 seconds when starting to have sex, or ejaculation before having sex.\n\nCauses of premature ejaculation\nPremature ejaculation comes from many causes, it can be due to physical, pathological or psychological stress, fatigue, unreasonable living habits, eating and exercise also affect the ability to ejaculate. men's sperm. The most common victims are young people who lack experience in bed, and it also happens to experienced people with erectile dysfunction or excessive stress. There are some possible \"culprits\" that cause physiological weakness as follows (2):\nErectile dysfunction: Men with erectile dysfunction often have the mentality of having to have sex in a hurry so they can ejaculate before the penis deflates, leading to premature ejaculation. The short time it takes for ejaculation to occur will affect the man's psychology, thereby affecting the erection ability of the penis, forming a pathological spiral between erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation.\nDue to psychology: When a man is unable to control ejaculation, leading to short ejaculation time, it will affect the sexual satisfaction of both men and their partners. Anxiety and low self-esteem about short ejaculation times in previous relationships will affect new relationships. Men will have psychological problems, problems with their partners, then men's erection will be affected, and a spiral of psychological illness will form.; Other risk factors: genetics, endocrine disorders, chronic prostatitis, stress, intercourse situations...\n\nIs premature ejaculation dangerous?\nAccording to experts, premature ejaculation is not life-threatening, but it greatly affects a man's sexual life, psychology and even fertility (can reduce fertility). , even causing infertility) and many other consequences. Specifically:\nPremature ejaculation directly affects a man's sexual pleasure, achieving orgasm is extremely luxurious.; Premature ejaculation, if prolonged, can cause diseases such as erectile dysfunction, even impotence, reduced/lost fertility.; When you cannot control the \"position of battle\", \"the top tells the bottom not to listen\" makes men mentally depressed and tired, affecting their lives and work to some extent.; With family life: Disharmony in the bedroom has a great impact on family happiness. Husband and wife easily conflict, which can lead to broken families.\nPremature ejaculation greatly affects men's lives, so it needs to be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible.\n\nDiagnosis of premature ejaculation\nTo know exactly about their physiological condition, men should have a medical examination so that the doctor can explore the patient's medical history, as well as the patient's current sex life and possibly do some necessary tests to diagnose the condition. Accurately predict the patient's physiological condition.\n1. Ask about medical history and medical history\nThe doctor will ask questions to understand the patient's physiological situation such as:\n1/ When having sex, is it difficult or easy for you to delay ejaculation?\n2/ During the past 6 months, when having sex, how often did you ejaculate prematurely?\n3/ Have you ever had sex, even with just a little stimulation, made you ejaculate?\n4/ Do you feel disappointed when you ejaculate before you want to?\n5/ Are you worried that your ejaculation time will leave your partner unsatisfied?\nFrom the patient's answers, the doctor can partly diagnose the patient's physiological condition, whether the patient has premature ejaculation or not.\nThe doctor will have questions to diagnose the patient's health condition\n2. Conduct a clinical examination\nThe patient will have a general examination of the cardiovascular system, neuropsychiatric diseases, metabolic disorders and genitals as well as the prostate to review and evaluate risk factors and etiology of the disease.\n3. Paraclinical testing\nIf a man simply has premature ejaculation, laboratory tests are usually not necessary. However it is also possible to do:\nUrine test to see if the urinary tract is infected or not; Tests to screen for causes such as blood fats, blood sugar, and hormones that can cause erectile dysfunction in cases of both premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction.\n\nTreatment and control of premature ejaculation in men\nTo treat premature ejaculation effectively, patients need to clearly determine where the cause of premature ejaculation comes from to have appropriate treatment. Treatment of premature ejaculation, in addition to using medication and surgery, can be treated with psychology, exercise, and changes in cognition and daily living habits.\n1. Psychological and behavioral control therapy\nLearn to adjust behavior: In some cases, patients can treat premature ejaculation by changing their sexual habits. Patients who recognize signs of premature ejaculation need to breathe deeply and slowly to help control their will to inhibit the ejaculation reflex. You should practice many times (4-5 weeks) to become a conditioned reflex.; The stop-start method (interval method) is often applied to many couples. With starting and stopping, your partner will stimulate the penis until ejaculation is imminent. Then, the partner stops until the man regains control. It is advisable to repeat this action twice, then engage in the fourth attempt and allow yourself to ejaculate. According to the American Urological Association, you should try this three times a week until you feel like you can control your ejaculation better.; Squeeze method: With the squeezing method, the partner stimulates the male penis until he is close to ejaculation. Then they squeeze the penis until the erection begins to weaken. This will help you be more aware of the feeling before climax, thereby helping men have better control and delay ejaculation.\n2. Treat premature ejaculation with medication\nIn some cases that cannot be corrected by behavior, premature ejaculation is treated with medication, or both can be combined to achieve the best results.\nDepending on the problem a man is experiencing, the doctor will prescribe the appropriate medication\nDapoxetine: is an SSRI drug for premature ejaculation approved in Europe and other countries. Many RCT studies show that Dapoxetine 30mg or 60mg used 1-2 hours before intercourse can improve vaginal ejaculation time, increase ejaculation control, relieve psychological factors and increase satisfaction. sexually satisfied. Besides Dapoxetine, there are also medicinal preparations used for off-label treatment.; Local anesthetic: Using a spray or applying it on the foreskin has a local anesthetic effect, reduces sensation and temporarily delays ejaculation. However, the drug has side effects of heating and burning the foreskin and making the penis itch, which can affect the anesthetic to the partner during sex.; Antidepressants: The side effect of antidepressants is slowing down orgasm, so they are used to treat premature ejaculation. However, this drug has other unwanted effects, including causing nausea and drowsiness; Tramadol pain reliever: In addition to pain relief, the drug also has the ability to delay ejaculation. Use of this drug must be according to prescription because this drug can cause dangerous addiction to the user.; Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: These include fluvoxamine and citalopram, paroxetine, sertraline or fluoxetine. These medications can be taken daily, helping to prolong ejaculation time by 2 - 10 times. The drug is used for several months. Possible side effects of the drug include fatigue, nausea, muscle weakness, tremors and loose stools. This condition usually appears in the first week and gradually disappears after 2-3 weeks.; Medicines to treat erectile dysfunction when both premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction occur. PDE5 enzyme inhibitors such as tadalafil (Cialis) and sildenafil (Viagra)... can help men maintain an erection and ejaculate more slowly. Doctors can advise patients to use a combination of dapoxetine and PDE5-i to prolong the time of erection of the penis until ejaculation, in addition to limiting the effects of Dapoxetine on erectile ability during treatment. premature ejaculation.\nNote, when using medications to treat premature ejaculation, you need to follow your doctor's instructions to prevent unwanted effects such as dizziness, nausea, blurred vision, constipation, reduced sperm quality, etc.\n3. Surgery\nCurrently, no surgery is considered capable of improving vaginal ejaculation time.\nThe Center for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts in internal medicine and surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
