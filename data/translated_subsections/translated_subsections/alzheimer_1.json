Scientists are studying how age-related changes in the brain may damage neurons and affect other types of brain cells to contribute to this phenomenon. These age-related changes include atrophy of certain parts of the brain, inflammation, damage to blood vessels, production of free radicals, and mitochondrial dysfunction.\nAlzheimer's is known to be a common cause of dementia. The disease is named after the psychiatrist Dr. Alois Alzheimer who first described the disease. In 1906, this doctor noticed changes in the brain tissue of a woman who died from an unusual mental illness. That patient's symptoms included memory loss, language problems and uncontrolled behavior. After the patient died, he examined the brain and found many abnormal clumps called amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, or “tau” tangles.\nVietnam is also one of the countries with the fastest population aging rate in the world with 10.1 million elderly people, accounting for 11% of the total population (2). Aging is a law of nature, the longer the lifespan, the closer the aging process becomes. However, Alzheimer's is not normal aging. It is a disease that causes many parts of the brain to gradually atrophy, especially the hippocampus, which is where memories are stored and created.\nOver time, people with Alzheimer's lose their memory and ability to concentrate. Orientation in space and time becomes increasingly difficult, and patients also find it difficult to manage themselves in daily life.",
