    "subsection_content": "1. How long can you live with Alzheimer's disease?\nCaring for patients with advanced Alzheimer's often faces many difficulties. Alzheimer's disease is the 6th leading cause of death across all ages in the United States and the 5th leading cause of death among people 65 years of age and older.\nMany people wonder how long they can live with Alzheimer's. According to statistics, the life expectancy of each patient is different. The average life expectancy after diagnosis is 8 to 10 years. However, in some cases, it can be shorter or longer. Each person has a unique health history. This health history is directly related to how the disease will affect them.\n2. Is the disease hereditary?\nMost patients have a late-onset form of the disease, in which symptoms become apparent in the mid-60s. In contrast, early-onset Alzheimer's disease is very rare, accounting for less than 10% of all people with it. The disease usually occurs in the 30s and mid-60s. Some cases are caused by a genetic change in one of three genes.\nThree single gene mutations linked to early-onset Alzheimer's disease are:\nAmyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21; Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) on chromosome 14; Presenilin 2 (PSEN2) on chromosome 1\nMutations in these genes lead to the production of abnormal proteins that are associated with disease. Each of these mutations plays a different role in disrupting APP, a protein whose exact function is not yet fully understood. This breakdown is part of the process that creates harmful amyloid plaques, which are considered a sign of Alzheimer's disease.\nA child whose biological parent carries a mutation in one of these three genes has a 50/50 chance of inheriting that mutation. If the mutation is in fact genetic, the child has a very high chance of developing early-onset Alzheimer's disease.\nFor other cases of early-onset disease, research has shown that other genetic components are involved. Studies are ongoing to identify additional genetic risk variants.\nHaving Down syndrome increases the risk of developing early-stage Alzheimer's disease. Many people with Down syndrome develop the disease as they age, with symptoms appearing in their 50s or 60s. Researchers believe this is because people with Down syndrome are born with an extra copy complement of chromosome 21, carrying the APP gene.\n3. Does the disease appear in young people?\nAs mentioned above, early-onset Alzheimer's disease is very rare, accounting for less than 10% of all people with Alzheimer's disease. It usually occurs in a person's 30s and mid-60s. Some cases are due to genetic changes.\nDiseases related to the nervous system are increasing in Vietnam, but what is worrying is that most patients do not have enough knowledge about the disease, and are often subjective when the rash signs appear. causes the condition to become more and more serious.\nDepartment of Neurology, Tam Anh General Hospital brings together a team of leading experts including leading professors and experienced doctors in the field of neurology. In addition, with a modern equipment system and application of advanced techniques in diagnosis and treatment, the Department of Neurology has successfully treated millions of patients with neurological diseases such as: pain. migraine, chronic headaches, stroke, sleep disorders, dementia, Alzheimer's, epilepsy, Parkinson's,...\nIn order to meet the medical examination and treatment needs of the people, the Department of Neurology constantly improves the quality of expertise, service and medical research, all with the goal of patient satisfaction.\nAlzheimer's disease attacks silently, leaving patients unable to perceive changes in their thinking and behavior. Sympathy, understanding, and dedicated care from family members will help them not feel lonely and the progression of the disease will also be much slower.",
