    "subsection_content": "Our brains are made up of more than 100 billion neurons – more than there are stars in the galaxy. Dementia damages nerve cells so that they are no longer able to communicate effectively, and this affects the way our bodies work.\nThe specific symptoms a person living with Alzheimer's experiences will depend on which parts of the brain are affected or the specific disease that is causing their dementia. Symptoms may include:\n1. Dementia of memory and cognitive ability\nMost people's memory and other cognitive abilities gradually become worse as they age. At this time, the body can no longer react quickly and flexibly to situations, this is considered a natural part of the aging process. Recognizing and solving problems that arise is often more difficult, but they can still access the knowledge they have acquired over the years and stay oriented, independent and able to make judgments. guess correctly.\nThis is different for people with Alzheimer's disease. One of the most common signs of the disease, especially in the early stages, is that the patient cannot remember recently learned information, and short-term memory is more affected. This means that the person forgets recent events, but can still recall experiences from long ago. But long-term memory also fades over time. Concentration is also affected, making it increasingly difficult to maintain orientation in time and space.\nIt becomes more difficult to relate things learned in the past to new situations or impressions. There comes a time when it is no longer possible to understand the context or evaluate information, form an opinion, and then decide what to do. For example, a terminal patient may see that it is raining outside and may be able to express this in words. But they will not be able to draw conclusions for their own actions. Then they can go out shopping wearing a t-shirt instead of buying a raincoat or umbrella.\n2. Difficulty expressing yourself in language\nPeople with Alzheimer's may have difficulty following or participating in a conversation. They may stop in the middle of a conversation and have no idea how to continue the conversation or may repeat what they said before.\nAs symptoms of the disease progress, it becomes more difficult to correctly remember words and people instead use words or phrases that are out of context. This makes it difficult for others to understand them. And people with dementia also forget the meaning of words and are then often no longer able to follow conversations. This makes it increasingly difficult for them to communicate verbally.\n3. Changes in behavior, mood, personality\nMany patients experience noticeable changes in behavior. The patient's mood and personality may change. They may become confused, suspicious, depressed, scared or anxious. They can easily lose their temper at home, at work, when with friends, or in places where they feel uncomfortable.\nIn addition, the patient may begin to give up hobbies, social activities, work projects or sports. The patient may also shy away from social interactions due to the changes they experience. Right. Sometimes they feel tired because of work, family and social responsibilities.\nSome people may experience changes in their ability to develop and carry out plans or work with numbers. Therefore, things that were considered familiar before will gradually become more difficult and unfamiliar to the patient. For example, not being able to drive to a place even though you have gone many times before, not being able to calculate bills, or having difficulty reading and understanding, not knowing how to use household objects...\n4. Confusion about time or place\nPeople with Alzheimer's may forget dates, seasons, and changes in time. For example, they are standing at a place but they do not remember how they got here, what they came here for. Besides, the patient also has many difficulties in trying to understand an event that happened immediately, at the same time. there.\n5. Putting things in the wrong place and not being able to remember what you used to do\nThe patient may place objects in unusual places. They may lose things and cannot remember to find them again. Therefore, there are many cases where patients think someone has stolen their things, and this will happen more often in the future.",
