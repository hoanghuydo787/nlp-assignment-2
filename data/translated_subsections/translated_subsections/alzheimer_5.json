An Alzheimer's patient may:\nDo not inform others that they are in pain, such as toothache, arm pain, etc.; Unable to comply with treatment regimen; Do not report or describe side effects of the drug\nAs the disease progresses to the final stages, brain changes begin to affect physical functions, such as swallowing, behavioral control, etc. Most Alzheimer's patients do not die from the main disease but often from other causes. Comorbidities such as:\nPneumonia: This is a condition in which the lungs become edematous and infected due to inhalation of mucus from gastric juice, or from food... into the lungs or respiratory tract.; Infection: Patients often have incontinence and need to have a catheter, increasing the risk of urinary tract infection. If not treated, it will become more severe and can be life-threatening.; Falling and getting injured: Patients will often have difficulty navigating distances, so the risk of falling when moving and exercising increases. This leads to possible broken bones, severe head and neck injuries that can lead to bleeding, hematomas... severe cases require hospitalization for surgery and inpatient care.",
