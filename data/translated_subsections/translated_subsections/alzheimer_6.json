The disease is diagnosed if someone has typical symptoms and no other cause is found. Assessing brain images using techniques such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not enough to tell if someone has the disease. (4)\nBecause symptoms such as forgetfulness, behavioral changes and problems with orientation can have many different causes, it is important not to jump to conclusions about whether you have the disease or not. Symptoms can also be caused by depression or other physical conditions such as meningitis, stroke, or bleeding in the brain. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies, or medication side effects, can also sometimes cause symptoms like these.\nSome treatments can help relieve symptoms, gradually improve or disappear completely. Alzheimer's disease is only diagnosed if symptoms have persisted for more than 6 months and any other cause is considered unlikely.\nTherefore, a general examination and laboratory tests are necessary. If you are worried that you have symptoms of the disease, go see and seek advice from a neurologist. This will be helpful in diagnosing, treating and detecting the disease, especially when the disease is still in its early stages.\nIn addition, screening options to detect cognitive function decline such as MMSE, Mini-Cog and MoCA are also often used.\nThe MMSE scale has a cutoff point for diagnosing dementia of 26. In addition to clinical manifestations, the stage of the disease can be diagnosed according to the MMSE scale (according to NICE 2011):; Mild Alzheimer's disease: MMSE 21 – 26; Moderate Alzheimer's disease: MMSE 10 – 20; Moderate-severe Alzheimer's disease: MMSE 10 – 14; Severe Alzheimer's disease: MMSE less than 10\nSpecialized assessment tests are often used to determine in detail each cognitive function such as memory, language, executive function, structural vision, and focused attention.\nAssessment of daily living activities: Experts often use basic (ADL - Activity of Daily Living) and advanced (IADL - Instrumental Activity of Daily Living) assessment scales to check the impact of daily living activities. cognitive ability on daily activities; Mental behavioral assessment: More than 80% of patients showed signs of mental behavioral disorders such as depression, hallucinations, paranoia, apathy, and agitation.",
