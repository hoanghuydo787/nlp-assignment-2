Loneliness and self-pity are what patients fear the most. They can sulk and sit in one place without paying attention to their children and grandchildren even if nothing happens. What they need is care and sincere loving relationships from relatives and people around them.\nThis is a very complex disease and cannot be completely cured with medication or other interventions. Current approaches focus on helping people maintain mental function, manage behavioral symptoms and slow some problems, such as memory loss. Researchers work to develop therapies that target specific genetic, molecular, and cellular mechanisms that can prevent the underlying cause of disease.\n1. Medicines maintain mental function\nMedications used to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease work by modulating neurotransmitters, chemicals that transmit messages between nerve cells, helping to reduce symptoms and resolve some of the symptoms. behavioral problems. However, these medications may be effective for some but not everyone and may only be helpful for a limited time.\n2. Drugs that control behavior\nCommon behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer's disease include insomnia, wandering, agitation, anxiety, and becoming short-tempered and aggressive. Scientists are learning why these symptoms occur and are studying new treatments, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to control the disease. Research has shown that treating behavioral symptoms can make sufferers more comfortable and help caregivers feel lighter.\n3. Research and test new treatment methods\nResearch on Alzheimer's disease has advanced to the point where scientists are looking for ways to delay or prevent the disease as well as treat its symptoms. In ongoing clinical trials supported by the NIA, scientists are developing and testing a number of possible interventions. Several studies of drug therapies target a variety of targets, including beta-amyloid protein, cerebrovascular function, synaptic loss and specific neurotransmitters, as well as interventions such as physical activity, diet, cognitive training and a combination of these approaches.",
