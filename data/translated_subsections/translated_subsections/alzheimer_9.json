However, the disease can come early or late, the severity or severity depends on our lifestyle and activities. Therefore, there are many ways to prevent early disease and control dangerous complications such as:\n1. Prevent cardiovascular diseases\nAccording to research, 80% of people with Alzheimer's have problems related to cardiovascular disease. Not only that, in some people, the brain has characteristic clumps and tangles but there are no signs of Alzheimer's.\nTo explain this problem, according to experts, these plaques and tangles only appear when the cerebrovascular system also has problems. That means cardiovascular disease is an important factor that increases the risk of disease. Therefore, people with hypertension, diabetes mellitus (diabetes), dyslipidemia (high blood fats) need to immediately control these disorders, because in the long term they will lead to cardiovascular disease.\n2. Exercise regularly\nFor people with Alzheimer's disease, exercise can help delay symptoms. Exercise needs to follow an expert's regimen to provide abundant blood and oxygen to nourish the brain.\n3. Avoid head injuries\nResearch shows that there is a clear link between severe head trauma and the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's later in life, especially injuries that lead to loss of consciousness. Therefore, you should protect your head and avoid unnecessary injuries.\n4. Eat scientifically\nA balanced menu of nutrients including lots of fresh vegetables and fruits, whole grains, olive oil, peanuts, fish, chicken, eggs, dairy products... helps enhance brain health. Be sure to limit your intake of red meat and sugar.\n5. Sleep on time, get enough sleep and get quality sleep\nGood sleep can help prevent Alzheimer's from coming early and becoming more severe. Because during sleep, the brain will \"clean\" the synapses so that information transmission is clear, filter out unnecessary memories, and clear away amyloid β to avoid creating plaques. Sleeping 8 hours a night without medication is ideal…",
