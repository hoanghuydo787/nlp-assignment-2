    "subsection_content": "Most cases of indigestion are related to stomach acid. Specifically, the organ always has a strong mucosal layer, performing the task of protecting the surface from the effects of acids. When this layer is eroded, under the influence of acid, the stomach is easily irritated, leading to inflammation. Some other causes may also occur but are usually insignificant.\nSometimes, stomach fluids spill out, moving into the top part of the small intestine. This organ does not have a protective mucosal layer so it is more susceptible to damage. Acid can also reflux from the stomach into the esophagus, called acid reflux.(1)\nThis condition is also often accompanied by some symptoms of indigestion, such as: belching, heartburn...
