    "subsection_content": "An anal abscess is a condition in which the cavity near the anus or rectum fills with pus, causing pain to the patient. Most cases are caused by acute infection of the internal glands. Sometimes, bacteria, feces or foreign objects can also block the anal gland, penetrate the surrounding tissue and then collect in the cavity, causing an abscess.(1)\nClassification of abscesses\nAbscesses are classified based on the location of formation, related to structures around the rectum and anus, including:\nPerianal abscess: This is the most common type, accounting for up to 60% of cases. Perianal abscesses often appear as pus under the skin, are painful, swollen, red and feel warm to the touch.; Perianal abscess: This is the most common type, accounting for up to 60% of cases. Perianal abscesses often appear as pus under the skin, are painful, swollen, red and feel warm to the touch.\nIschiorectal fossa abscess: This is the second most common type of abscess, formed by compression through the external anal sphincter, entering the rectum. In some cases, the abscess can spread to the deep space behind the anus, entering the side to form a horseshoe abscess.; Ischiorectal fossa abscess: This is the second most common type of abscess, formed by compression through the external anal sphincter, entering the rectum. In some cases, the abscess can spread to the deep space behind the anus, entering the side to form a horseshoe abscess.\nIntersphincteric abscess: This is the result of compression between the internal and external anal sphincters. This type of abscess can be completely located in the anal canal, causing symptoms of severe pain, only detected during rectal examination or digital endoscopy.; Intersphincteric abscess: This is the result of compression between the internal and external anal sphincters. This type of abscess can be completely located in the anal canal, causing symptoms of severe pain, only detected during a rectal examination or digital endoscopy.\nSuprasphincteric abscess: This is the least common type, causing pelvic and rectal pain, often diagnosed by computed tomography (CT).; Suprasphincteric abscess: This is the least common type, causes pelvic and rectal pain, and is often diagnosed with computed tomography (CT).",
