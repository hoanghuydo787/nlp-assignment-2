However, the pain caused by this condition often occurs suddenly, quickly becoming more severe after only 1-2 days. Therefore, applying conventional treatment methods for hemorrhoids is completely ineffective. Additionally, abscesses also tend to be accompanied by symptoms of infection, including fever and chills at night.",
