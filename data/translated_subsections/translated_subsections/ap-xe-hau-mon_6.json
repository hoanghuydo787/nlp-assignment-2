    "subsection_content": "The simplest and most common treatment for an anal abscess is to drain the pus from the infected area. Specifically, the doctor will use anesthetics, then perform suction to reduce pain, discomfort and heal tissues.\nIf the abscess is large, the patient may be prescribed surgery under anesthesia. After drainage, the wound will be left open and no stitches will be needed. In case the patient is diabetic or has a weakened immune system, the doctor may ask to stay in the hospital for a few days to monitor for infection (if any). Additionally, some post-drainage treatments include:\nUse antibiotics in cases where the patient has a weakened immune system or widespread infection.; Use laxatives or fiber supplements to avoid constipation.; Take a warm bath to reduce swelling; Regular follow-up examinations as prescribed by your doctor to monitor for recurrence.; Horseshoe-shaped anal abscess, on the levator muscle, extending through the obturator foramen, and Fournier's necrosis requires treatment by an experienced hospital and surgeon.",
