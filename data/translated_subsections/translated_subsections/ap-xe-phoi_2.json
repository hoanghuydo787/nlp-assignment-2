These are the most common bacteria, accounting for more than 60% of the causes of lung abscesses. (first); Staphylococcus aureus: The clinical picture is quite severe when it damages the lung parenchyma and pleura, there is a risk of lung failure syndrome, infection, severe poisoning... for the patient.; Klebsiella Pneumoniae: Progresses and spreads very quickly, the disease is very severe, and the risk of death is high.; Other bacteria such as pneumococcus, group A or hemolytic streptococcus, Gram (-) bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae also increase the risk of disease.; Parasites: The most common is Amoeba, which can be primary but most cases are secondary to liver and intestinal abscesses. This lesion is often found at the base of the right lung, close to the diaphragm and is often accompanied by damage to the pleura. The typical symptoms are cough with chocolate-colored phlegm mixed with fresh blood.; Some other causes that can cause the disease are superinfected bronchial cocoons, necrotic primary cancer, bronchiectasis, tuberculous cavities, congenital pulmonary cocoons, open chest injuries, tracheal intubation...",
