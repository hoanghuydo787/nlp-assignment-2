Detail:\nStage 1: Inflammatory stage\nMost cases start out as severe pneumonia, the patient has a high fever of up to 39-40 degrees Celsius, dry lips, dirty tongue, and bad breath. Some patients may experience symptoms of decreased urination and dark urine. A few other cases have a gradual onset like the flu syndrome.\nStage 2: The pus stage\nThis is the stage when lung abscess symptoms appear most clearly, helping to diagnose the condition accurately.\nSymptoms of the disease may appear as early as 5-6 days, or may occur very late, about 50-60 days after the onset of the disease.; Symptoms include cough and chest pain. The patient may cough up pus, the pus may spit out a lot of about 300 - 500ml within 24 hours or the pus may be coughed up a little but lasts a long time.; Characteristics of pus: If the causative agent is a virus, the pus will have a rotten smell; If the agent is an amoeba, the pus is colored like chocolate; Also, when a biliary abscess ruptures into the lungs, the pus is yellow like bile; After pus poisoning, patients can see their fever symptoms gradually decrease and feel more comfortable. In case the pus has been expelled many times but the temperature is still high, it may be because there is another abscess that has not burst yet.\nStage 3: Cave formation stage\nAt this stage, the patient may still cough up pus but less. If the patient's body temperature increases suddenly, it shows that the pus may be poorly drained and still stagnant in the lungs.",
