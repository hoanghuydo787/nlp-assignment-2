If not treated promptly, or treated improperly, or if the response is not good, it may progress to a chronic abscess or leave a cavity. At this time, the patient is at risk of experiencing dangerous complications such as:\nBronchiectasis around the abscess; Purulent fluid appeared in the pleura and pericardium due to rupture of the abscess;; Sepsis;; Brain abscess, meningitis;; Severe hemoptysis;; Exhaustion and degeneration of organs, even threatening the patient's life.\nThe disease can threaten the patient's life if not treated promptly",
