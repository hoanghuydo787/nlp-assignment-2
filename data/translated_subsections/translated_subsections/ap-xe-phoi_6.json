Based on that, he will prescribe further paraclinical methods to make the diagnosis most accurate.\nBlood tests: Blood test results showing increased white blood cell count, or other tests such as increased CRP-hs, indicate infection.; Sputum or pus sample testing: This test is indicated when the doctor suspects that the patient has signs of the disease.; X-ray or CT scan: The typical image of a lung abscess on an X-ray is a round shape with irregular edges, quite thick and containing fluid inside. This is the same way to accurately determine the location of an abscess.; Bronchoscopy: The doctor uses a small tube with a light and camera at the end to pass through the nose or mouth, into the trachea to remove a sample of sputum or lung tissue. This method is used in cases where the patient is treated with antibiotics but the disease does not improve, or if the airway is suspected to be clogged or the immune system is weakened.\nX-ray images can clearly show damage to lung tissue",
