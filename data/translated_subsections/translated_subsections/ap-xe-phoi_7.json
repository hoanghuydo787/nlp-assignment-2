    "subsection_content": "Prof. Dr. Ngo Quy Chau said that there are many different methods of treating lung abscesses depending on the patient's condition and level of lung tissue damage. In particular, medical treatment is quite long, usually lasting about 4-6 weeks. Therefore, it requires patients to coordinate and follow the doctor's treatment instructions to achieve the best results.\n1. Medical treatment\nTreatment with antibiotics: Combination of at least 2 types of antibiotics, which can be administered intravenously or intramuscularly, using high doses from the beginning. Use antibiotics immediately after obtaining a specimen for microbiological testing from the patient. Antibiotics can be changed based on clinical characteristics and antibiogram. However, note that this change requires a doctor's prescription and patients should not adjust it on their own. Use antibiotics for a minimum of 4 weeks. This process can last up to 6 weeks depending on the patient's clinical response and chest X-ray results.; Combining at least 2 types of antibiotics, can be used intravenously or intramuscularly, using high doses from the beginning.; Use antibiotics immediately after obtaining a specimen for microbiological testing from the patient. Antibiotics can be changed based on clinical characteristics and antibiogram. However, note that this change requires a doctor's prescription, patients are not allowed to adjust it on their own; Use antibiotics for a minimum of 4 weeks. This process can last up to 6 weeks depending on the patient's clinical response and chest X-ray results.; Drainage of the abscess. Drainage in the chest vibration position: Based on the upright and tilted chest X-ray film, choose the drainage position and chest vibration for the patient. Positional drainage can be done several times a day, leaving the patient in the best drainage position, gradually increasing the time combined with vibration. Vibration also gradually increases over time, you can vibrate 2-3 times a day, at first for about 5 minutes, then increase to 10-20 minutes. It is possible to suction pus from the bronchus and drain the abscess by performing flexible bronchoscopy. In addition, flexible bronchoscopy also helps detect lesions that block the bronchi, or remove foreign objects in the bronchi, if any. Percutaneous puncture and drainage of pus: This method is applied to peripheral lung abscesses, that is, abscesses that do not communicate with the bronchi, abscesses that are close to the chest wall or adhere to the pleura. Use a specialized catheter placed into the abscess and continuously suction and drain.

Positional drainage can be done several times a day, leaving the patient in the best drainage position, gradually increasing the time combined with vibration. Vibration also gradually increases over time, you can vibrate 2-3 times/day, at first for about 5 minutes, then increase to 10-20 minutes.; It is possible to suction pus from the bronchus and drain the abscess by performing flexible bronchoscopy.

Use a specialized catheter placed into the abscess and continuously suction and drain. (3)\n2. Surgical treatment\nIn about 10% of abscess cases, doctors prescribe surgical intervention, mainly surgery to remove lung segments, or remove one side of the lung depending on the extent of damage. Cases where surgical treatment is indicated include:\nWhen the abscess is larger than 10cm;; Medical treatments have been applied but are ineffective;; The patient coughs up blood repeatedly, threatening his life;; Lung abscess combined with bronchiectasis causes severe localization;; Complications of broncho-pleural fistula appeared, medical treatment had no results;; Lung cancer abscesses at the stage where the tumor is still operable.\n3. Supportive treatment\nFollow a scientific diet, providing adequate nutrients and energy for the patient's body, especially protein and vitamins;; Replenish water, maintain water and electrolyte balance;; Reduce pain symptoms, reduce fever;; Use oxygen therapy to support the patient's breathing.",
