Is lung abscess dangerous?\nAs an infectious disease of the lungs, lung abscess is dangerous if the patient is not detected early and treated promptly, or treated improperly because it can lead to dangerous complications such as bronchiectasis, Brain abscess, meningitis, severe hemoptysis, organ failure, even threatening the patient's life.\nHowever, the disease can still be prevented and treated well if the patient receives treatment early, as soon as unusual symptoms are detected.\n2.

How long can people with lung abscess live?\nBefore antibiotics were available, statistics showed that about 1/3 of lung abscess cases were fatal, only 1/3 of cases recovered, the remainder turned into chronic disease, empyema or bronchiectasis. . Today, with the advancement of medicine as well as the support of many modern machinery and equipment, the disease has been treated successfully, leaving no sequelae.\nHowever, it is recommended that when patients detect symptoms of high fever, cough, or chest pain, they should immediately go to a reputable medical facility equipped with modern equipment and a team of highly skilled doctors for treatment. Best treatment, don't miss the \"golden time\" for treatment.\nFor advice and to schedule an examination for respiratory diseases at the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nAlthough lung abscess is a dangerous infection, it can be cured quickly thanks to advances in modern medicine.
