In case of injury or ulcers, early care with the right method is necessary and important to help the wound heal quickly for the patient.\n1. Local wound care\nToday, through research and practice, people have come up with the concept of important steps in wound care such as: TIME and MOIST concepts. These concepts include tasks that need to be performed in wound care such as: controlling wound infection, controlling wound exudate, debridement of necrotic tissue, providing local tissue oxygen, Stimulates the process of granulation tissue and wound healing; With advances in science, there are many means to help with local wound care such as: cleaning solutions - hypochlorite (HOCL), Prontosan solutions, Betadine...; New wound dressings help control exudate and local infection such as: Foam, Alginate, silver or honey-soaked gauze to help control odor and infection. Gauze helps keep the environment moist for the wound to heal quickly.; Devices that help control secretions and stimulate tissue such as: Vacuum assisted closure (VAC) negative pressure suction device; Drugs that stimulate granulation tissue and epidermis such as growth factors and substances that provide oxygen sources at the wound site help heal wounds quickly.\n2.
