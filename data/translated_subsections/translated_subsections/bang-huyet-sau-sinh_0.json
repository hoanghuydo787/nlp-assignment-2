    "subsection_content": "Postpartum Hemorrhage (English: Postpartum Hemorrhage) is a condition of bleeding over 500ml for vaginal birth or over 1000ml for cesarean section. Blood loss in postpartum hemorrhage can occur massively, suddenly, or gradually and discreetly.

Therefore, clinically postpartum hemorrhage can be determined based on more objective factors such as fluctuations in pulse, blood pressure, urine, Hematocrit...\nAll women who are pregnant beyond 20 weeks are at risk of postpartum bleeding. Although maternal mortality rates have decreased significantly in developed countries, hemorrhage remains the leading cause of maternal death in other regions (developing or underdeveloped countries).\n1. Two types of postpartum hemorrhage\nPrimary hemorrhage: Is early hemorrhage, occurring within the first 24 hours after birth; Secondary hemorrhage: Is bleeding that occurs from 24 hours to 12 weeks or more after giving birth.

Risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage\nAge: The older the pregnant woman is (over 35 years old), the more likely she is to have postpartum hemorrhage.; Body mass index (BMI): Obesity can increase bleeding complications during and after birth.
