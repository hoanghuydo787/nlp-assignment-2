    "subsection_content": "The labor process usually takes place through 3 stages: cervical dilation, fetal delivery stage and placental delivery - hemostasis stage. After delivery, the uterus contracts to reduce its volume. Because the placenta is not elastic, the shrinking of the uterus will cause the placenta to partially detach from its attachment position. Blood flows from the placenta to form a hematoma behind the placenta, and this hematoma will cause the placenta to continue to separate. Uterine contractions will slowly expel the placenta.\nAccording to the normal mechanism, after the delivery of the placenta, the uterus will begin to contract, the crisscross muscle fibers of the uterus will shorten and tighten the uterine blood vessels at the placenta attachment site like knots. The knots are called \"physiological knots\" and together with the body's normal blood clotting mechanism will form blood clots in the blood vessels to help stop bleeding. However, in many abnormal cases where the uterus does not contract or the placenta does not detach and the placenta does not come out, bleeding will occur.\nSome main causes of bleeding in postpartum women include:\n1. Uterine atony\nAccounting for 80% of the causes of hemorrhage, uterine atony occurs when the uterus cannot contract after the baby is born. The uterine muscles do not contract strongly enough, blood continues to flow freely, leading to hemorrhage and excessive blood loss.\nFactors that cause the uterine muscle to not contract after giving birth include:\nProlonged labor or rapid labor;; The uterus is too stretched or too big;; Use of oxytocin or other drugs or general anesthesia during labor;; Pregnant women have amniotic infection, anemia or weakness;; The pregnant woman has a blood clotting disorder and becomes pregnant at an older age (over 35 years old).\n2. Abnormalities of the placenta\nFor pregnant women with low-lying placenta, placenta accreta, or placenta previa, they tend to bleed a lot after giving birth. In addition, the large area of ​​the placenta, when it separates, causes a lot of bleeding, which can also cause signs of hemorrhage.\n3. Damage to the genital tract\nA ruptured or torn uterus or vagina can also be the cause of bleeding, including vaginal birth. This is a complication due to difficulty giving birth and requires surgical intervention. Some other cases such as giving birth prematurely or giving birth too quickly also cause great damage to the genital tract\n4. Blood clotting disorders\nBlood clotting disorders often occur in cases such as: Placental abruption, stillbirth, infection... Depending on the level of blood loss and recovery, bleeding during cesarean/vaginal birth can cause various severe or mild complications.",
