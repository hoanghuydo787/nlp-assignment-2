When a pregnant woman loses too much blood, she may experience dizziness, rapid pulse, low blood pressure, cold hands and feet, sweating, etc. Depending on the cause of bleeding, there are different specific symptoms. . (first)\n1. Cases of bleeding due to uterine atony\nSymptom\nFor pregnant women with bleeding due to uterine atony, bleeding will occur immediately after delivery of the placenta.; The uterus is dilated, soft, has poor or no contraction, and has no safe mass.; Can lead to shock if not treated promptly.\nTo solve\nUterine massage and tocolytic drugs to stimulate uterine contractions;; Use of uterotonic drugs including oxytocin, methylergonovine, prostaglandin;; Transfusion of blood, fluids and blood products;; In severe cases, treatment includes: Surgery to clamp the uterine blood vessels that cause bleeding. Uterine artery embolization, which involves inserting small pieces into the uterine artery to block blood from reaching the uterus.; Pregnant women are prescribed a hysterectomy if the above methods do not work.\n2. Cases of bleeding due to placental abnormalities\nSymptom\nThere are 2 cases of bleeding due to placental abnormalities:\nRetained placenta, retained membrane: Causes bleeding immediately after delivery of the placenta, poor uterine contraction, bleeding, the amount of blood may be more or less, bright red blood mixed with blood clots. Retained placenta can be detected early by examining the placenta and membranes.; Non-departure placenta: The placenta does not detach within 30 minutes after delivery or aggressive labor management measures are unsuccessful. At that time, the placenta adheres tightly and does not bleed. Partial placenta accreta means the placenta does not detach completely after 30 minutes of delivery, bleeding more or less depends on whether the area of ​​the placenta is wide or narrow.\nTo solve\nIn cases of bleeding due to retained placenta or membranes: Intravenous fluids should be given immediately. Give pain medication and perform uterine control. Use systemic antibiotics. Monitor pulse, blood pressure, bleeding and uterine contractions. Resuscitation with blood transfusion if acute anemia; In case of bleeding due to non-separation of the placenta: If bleeding, remove the placenta and control the uterus, massage the uterine fundus, resuscitate against shock, give antibiotics.; If the woman has bleeding partial placenta accreta or complete placenta accreta, she must have a hysterectomy.; If bleeding is heavy, shock resuscitation, blood transfusion and surgery are needed. Maintain uterine contraction according to general principles.\n3. Cases of bleeding due to genital tract trauma\nSymptom\nThe uterus contracts well but bright red blood still flows out of the vagina.
