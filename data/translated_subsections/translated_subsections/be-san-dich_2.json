    "subsection_content": "Some of the following causes easily lead to the risk of detecting lochia obstruction after giving birth:\n1. Caesarean section\nCaesarean section causes women to lose more blood than normal birth. The uterus contracts poorly, so the fluid is difficult to push out and gets stuck in the uterus.\n2. Excessive blood loss during birth\nBlood loss is a normal phenomenon during childbirth, but if there is too much blood loss, the uterus will contract poorly, or even completely lose the ability to contract to push out the lochia. This is the common cause of postpartum lochia obstruction.\n3. Postpartum complications\nComplications that occur during and after birth such as large fetuses, multiple pregnancies, polyhydramnios, prolonged labor, etc. will easily cause pregnant women to have blocked lochia.\n4. Postpartum care is not good\nWomen with weak health after giving birth force them to lie in one place, have little movement, or have poor hygiene in their private areas leading to infection... contributing to increasing the risk of ectopic pregnancy after cesarean/vaginal birth.\nPregnant women with multiple pregnancies have an increased risk of postpartum fluid retention\n5. Objective reasons\nWhen the mother's uterine muscle tone is poor, the cervix is ​​closed, the mother's health is depleted... it will make the lochia unable to escape.",
