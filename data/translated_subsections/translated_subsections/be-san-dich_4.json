    "subsection_content": "You cannot self-treat postpartum obstetrics and need to go to the hospital to be examined by a doctor and prescribe appropriate intervention. Common methods that doctors often apply for treatment are:\n1. Dilation of the cervix\nThis is the first way to treat lochia. The doctor dilates the cervix by inserting specialized tools to remove all cells and stagnant fluid from the uterus. M.D. Dinh Thi Hien Le noted that this procedure should be performed at medical facilities that ensure clean hygienic conditions to avoid infection or complications later.\n2. Aspirate uterine fluid\nSimilar to cervical dilation, with the uterine fluid aspiration method, the doctor also uses a specialized tool (a suction tube) to suck out all the fluid. This straw needs to be absolutely sterile; Otherwise, pregnant women will face potential dangers that will affect their future reproductive health.\n3. Use drugs to stimulate uterine contractions\nThe main cause of lochia blockage is poor uterine contractions and inability to push lochia out. Therefore, for treatment, doctors can prescribe medication to help stimulate strong uterine contractions; thereby pushing all remaining substances out.",
