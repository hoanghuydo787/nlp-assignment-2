    "subsection_content": "To prevent postpartum fluid stasis, mothers need to remember the following measures: (2)\n1. Clean the private area\nLochia is an ideal environment for bacteria and parasites to grow, causing vaginal and uterine infections. Therefore, women need to clean their private areas properly to avoid postpartum infections. Clean your vaginal area after each sanitary napkin change, preferably with warm water or diluted cleaning solution.\nIn addition, you should remember to use sanitary napkins specifically for pregnant women and change them regularly, 4-5 times a day. Do not use tampons, do not wipe the private area with chemical wet towels, do not douche, or take baths to avoid gynecological infections and increase the risk of disease.\n2. Walk and exercise lightly\nAfter giving birth, mothers should only lie down and rest for 6-8 hours, then get up and move gently. This helps the uterus contract and quickly expel the lochia, shortening the postpartum process.\n3. Breastfeed your baby early\nEarly breastfeeding is an indirect form of stimulating the uterus to contract to \"eliminate\" lochia. Therefore, you should follow some tips to stimulate milk production quickly (such as massaging the breasts, feeding the baby directly, using a breast pump...).\nMothers should breastfeed their babies as soon as possible to stimulate the uterus to contract and push the fluid out\n4. Reasonable diet\nPostpartum women should have their own diet to help increase milk supply and quickly eliminate lochia. There are many types of foods that should be on the menu for pregnant women such as Malabar spinach, amaranth, mugwort... They have the effect of enhancing milk supply and at the same time supporting the contraction process of the uterus, helping the lochia to be pushed out quickly. . In addition, fruits and vegetables such as luffa, green papaya, banana flower, turmeric... also have similar effects, stimulating milk glands, stabilizing the stomach and restoring the uterus.\n5. Frequent urination\nIn the first days after giving birth, your bladder may be less sensitive than usual. So you won't feel the need to urinate even when your bladder is quite full. In addition to causing urinary problems, a full bladder also makes it harder for the uterus to contract, making it harder for lochia to pass out. So, don't forget to go to the bathroom every 2-3 hours!",
