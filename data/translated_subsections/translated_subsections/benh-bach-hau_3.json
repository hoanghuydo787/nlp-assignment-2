    "subsection_content": "The reservoir for bacteria lies in sick people and healthy people carrying the bacteria. This is both a reservoir and a source of disease transmission.\nThe incubation period is usually from 2 to 5 days, possibly longer. The period of disease transmission is usually not fixed, can last about 2 weeks or shorter, at least over 4 weeks. Patients can eliminate bacteria from the onset, or possibly from the end of the incubation period. Healthy people can carry diphtheria bacteria for from a few days to 3 or 4 weeks; There are rare cases of chronic bacterial carriage lasting more than 6 months.\nThe disease is transmitted through the respiratory tract through contact with sick people or healthy people carrying diphtheria bacteria. The disease can also be transmitted by contact with objects contaminated with excretions from an infected person.",
