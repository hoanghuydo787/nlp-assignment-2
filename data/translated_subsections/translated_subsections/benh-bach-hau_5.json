    "subsection_content": "Depending on the location of the bacteria causing the disease, there will be different symptoms.\nAnterior nasal diphtheria: The patient has a runny nose, mucus discharge, sometimes with blood, and a white film on the nasal septum. The disease is usually mild because bacterial toxins rarely penetrate the blood; Diphtheria of the throat and tonsils: Patients have fatigue, sore throat, loss of appetite, mild fever. After 2 or 3 days, a necrotic cluster appears, forming a bluish-white pseudomembranous layer, tough and firmly attached to the tonsils, or it can spread to cover the entire pharyngeal area. In some cases, the patient may have swelling under the jaw and swollen lymph nodes in the neck, making the neck bulge like a cow's neck. In cases of severe poisoning, the patient will be lethargic, pale, have a rapid pulse, lethargy, and coma. Without aggressive treatment, these patients may die within 6 to 10 days.; Laryngeal diphtheria: A disease that progresses quickly and is dangerous. Patients have signs of mild fever, hoarseness, cough, pseudomembranes in the larynx or pharynx spreading down. If not treated promptly, pseudomembranes can cause airway obstruction, causing respiratory failure and rapid death.\nIn addition to the locations mentioned above, bacteria can also cause disease in a number of other locations, but these cases are very rare and have mild disease progression.",
