    "subsection_content": "The most common complications of the disease are myocarditis and neuritis. Complications of myocarditis can occur in the full-blown stage or can be delayed several weeks after the patient recovers. When myocarditis appears early in the disease, the mortality rate is often very high. Complications of neuritis often affect the motor nerves and will fully recover if the patient does not die from other complications.\nPalatal paralysis is another possible complication of diphtheria, usually appearing in the 3rd week of the disease. Paralysis of the oculomotor nerve, paralysis of the limb muscles and diaphragm may appear in the 5th week of the disease. Pneumonia and respiratory failure may occur as a result of diaphragmatic paralysis. In children, especially infants, complications such as conjunctivitis or respiratory failure may occur.\nThe disease can occur in the last 3 months of pregnancy or the postpartum period. The mortality rate of the disease for pregnant women is about 50%, ⅓ of survivors may have miscarriages or premature births. Early treatment with diphtheria antiserum can improve survival and pregnancy rates, but complications still require prolonged treatment.\nThe mortality rate of the disease usually ranges from 5% to 10% and can increase up to 20% in children under 5 years old and adults over 40 years old.",
