    "subsection_content": "Normally, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland in the brain work together to control the production of thyroid hormones. When thyroid hormone is low, the hypothalamus \"signals\" the pituitary gland to secrete thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).\nBut in Thyroid Basedow, the immune system attacks the TSH receptors so the body cannot tell the difference between the attack and the messages transmitted through the same receptors. Scientists found that in people with Graves' disease, the thyroid gland has the presence of antibodies that stimulate the thyroid gland to produce excessive thyroid hormones. (2)\nUntil now, the cause of the disease has not been accurately determined. However, some studies show that this disease is about 79% genetic.\nBesides originating from genetic factors, the disease can also be due to the impact of a number of other factors such as age, gender, living and working environment, constitution or possibly chemicals. Substances hidden in food accumulate every day.",
