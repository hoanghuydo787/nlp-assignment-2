    "subsection_content": "1. Hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxic syndrome):\nWeight loss is a common sign (loss of about 3-20kg in a short time) despite still having a good appetite. In some cases, weight gain becomes uncontrolled; Changes in personality and mood: feeling anxious, irritable, sensitive, difficult to concentrate, tired, difficult to sleep.; Body temperature regulation disorders: \"hot flashes\"; excessive sweating on the chest and hands (Basedow's hand sign), fear of heat, often feeling thirsty and drinking a lot of water.; Cardiovascular: nervousness, palpitations, suffocation, precordial pain.; Digestive disorders: increased frequency of bowel movements, broken stool texture due to increased intestinal motility (in about 20% of Basedow patients).; Feeling of nausea, vomiting, stomach pain.\n2. Diffuse goiter:\nGoiters are common in about 80% of people with Basedow's disease. Tumors are usually level II, diffuse, soft/firm density, and move when swallowing. Basedow is a type of angioma, so the systolic murmur can be felt and heard. Sometimes the goiter is small or sinks deep into the mediastinum.\nThe size of Basedow's tumor can change after treatment, making it easy to recognize in newly diagnosed patients.\nAs the disease progresses and the tumor develops, signs are easily noticeable such as: feeling a tumor in the middle of the neck, with clear boundaries, not attached to the skin, painless, moving with the rhythm of swallowing, when A goiter that is too large can cause uncomfortable pressure.\n3. Endocrine eye disease (found in about 40 - 60% of patients with Basedow's tumor):\nSymptoms of bulging eyes are common in female patients. Basedow's tumor is an autoimmune disease, related to a disorder and impaired immune system. Therefore, when suffering from this disease, the body will produce antibodies that attack the tissues and muscles around the eye area, causing eye problems. If these symptoms persist and are not treated properly, the patient will face the risk of losing vision.\nUsually, the first signs of eye complications may appear 6 months before or after 6 months of Graves' disease. Initial signs may include: a feeling of glare, dry eye fluid, a dusty feeling in the eye, pain in the eye socket, watery eyes... If not treated promptly, the patient finds it difficult to when moving eyes or closing eyes, blinking, bulging eyes, blindness...\nIf the disease becomes severe, it will cause dangerous eye complications\n4. Myxoma:\nThe skin thickens and cannot be pinched, especially in the lower tibia due to the accumulation of Glycosaminoglycan substances, sometimes appearing in the entire lower leg and can spread to the whole foot. The skin is rough, yellow brown or reddish purple.",
