    "subsection_content": "If the goiter is large, produces compression symptoms, or is accompanied by ocular changes typical of Basedow's disease, surgical treatment is indicated. In cases where the goiter is small in size or there is a high risk of surgery, a dose of radioactive iodine can be administered orally, which will take effect after 1-2 months.\nThe Endocrinologist will provide appropriate treatment for the patient\nSpecific treatment methods include:\n1. Medical treatment of Graves' goiter\nTreatment with oral synthetic antithyroid drugs: carbimazole, methimazole, propylthiouracil (PTU), helps inhibit thyroid hormone formation and begins to improve symptoms after 1-2 weeks.\nMethimazole is often the preferred treatment for children and adolescents with Basedow's disease. PTU is usually the safest choice during early pregnancy.\n2. Radioactive iodine treatment\nThis treatment destroys thyroid tissue to reduce hormone production. After the patient drinks a solution containing radioactive iodine, the thyroid gland will absorb the solution the same way the body absorbs iodine. Radiation accumulates in tissues and destroys them.\nThis is considered a cure for Basedow's disease. But it often leads to thyroid hormone levels that are too low (hypothyroidism). At this time, the patient may need to use synthetic thyroid hormones such as levothyroxine to compensate.\nThe word “radiation” may sound scary, but this treatment has been proven to be safe. In the US, more than 70% of people with hyperthyroidism are treated with this method. This treatment is also called radioiodine to reduce the patient's fear.\nPoint:\nPatients who cannot or do not want surgery such as heart failure...; The goiter does not shrink after medical treatment; Recurrence after surgery\nContraindications:\nPregnant/breastfeeding women; Younger people 16-18 years old; The patient has severe eye complications\n3. Surgical treatment\nSurgery for Basedow's disease involves removing most of the thyroid gland. This is also a method of treating hyperthyroidism. However, because the body is no longer able to produce thyroid hormones, it will cause hypothyroidism.\nAt this point, the patient needs to supplement synthetic thyroid hormone for the rest of their life. Patients can take it in pill form with a dosage of 1 pill/day. This supplement helps control thyroid levels, maintaining a healthy condition.\nNote, during treatment, patients need to see a doctor every 3-4 months to monitor possible side effects. After that period, about 40% of cases go into permanent remission, while the rest relapse.\nPoint:\nLarge goiter or multinodular goiter, tumor sunken in the chest; In case of recurrence after medical treatment; The patient wants to get pregnant soon\nContraindications:\nPatients with severe heart complications such as heart failure...; Elderly patients",
