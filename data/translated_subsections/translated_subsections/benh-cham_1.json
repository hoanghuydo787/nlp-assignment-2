    "subsection_content": "Eczema is classified into many types with quite similar symptoms, including: Atopic dermatitis, coin eczema, secondary reactive eczema, hand eczema, bacterial eczema, dyshidrotic eczema, etc. The doctor can diagnose the disease. Depending on the type of rash and the location on the body to determine the type of eczema you have, including: (2)\nAtopic dermatitis\nThis is the most common condition of eczema and affects many adults. Atopic dermatitis is also associated with other allergic disorders, such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. The disease often begins in childhood.\nContact dermatitis\nMost people have this condition at some point in their lives. It occurs when the skin comes into contact with something that causes a rash. The substance may cause irritation or an allergic reaction. Trigger factors for each person will be different and are divided into 2 types of contact dermatitis:\nIrritant dermatitis, this is the common type and is more closely related to atopic dermatitis. Possible pathogens include skin care products, soaps, and detergents; jewelry made of nickel, industrial chemicals such as solvents and cement.; Atopic dermatitis flares up when the skin comes into contact with allergens that cause allergies such as nickel, metals, beauty products containing perfume, rubber, and preservatives.\nThe disc disease\nThis is a less common form of eczema but is difficult to treat. The disease causes an outbreak of tiny blisters on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, edges of the fingers, edges of the hands, etc. The cause can also come from sweating or contact with irritants such as needles. type.\nNeurodermatitis\nThis type of eczema tends to cause one or two patches of intense itching, often on the back of the neck, arms, or legs. Risk factors include having another form of eczema, such as atopic dermatitis or contact dermatitis, or simply having too dry skin. However, the disease is also associated with a number of mental health problems such as anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Women between 30 and 50 years old are more likely to get the disease than others.\nIndigo coins/coins\nIt is a common disease, characterized by blisters concentrated in round, oval clusters, and severe itching. The disease is related to impaired skin barrier function. Nummular eczema can occur at any age, is more common in men than women, and men >50 years old are associated with chronic alcoholism.\nThe cause of the disease is unclear. Some factors that trigger the disease include local injuries such as scratches, old surgical wounds, insect bites or thermal burns; Contact dermatitis may present clinically as penny eczema; Other skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, impetigo, wound infections, etc.\nClinically, coin eczema is divided into two types: wet type (vesicles, blisters, lots of fluid) and dry type (subacute or chronic, dry, scaly lesions).\nInfected eczema (bacterial eczema)\nThe cause of the disease comes from factors such as fungal, bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections. Superficial fungal infections, especially athlete's foot, are the most common cause.\nClinical manifestations of bacterial eczema are quite diverse: Diffuse or localized vesicles, maculopapular or scarlet rash, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme, centrifugal ring erythema, Sweet's syndrome, erythema nodosum. psoriatic lesions, diffuse red maculopapular pustular rashes, etc. The general mechanism is hypersensitivity reaction, however different clinical manifestations will have different corresponding types of hypersensitivity. The key to treatment is to eliminate the cause.\nHand eczema\nHand eczema is an inflammatory skin disease limited to the hands, common in adults with a rate of about 10%. The disease is classified according to disease progression:\nAcute or subacute hand eczema: Lasts less than 3 months or does not recur within 1 year.; Chronic hand eczema: Lasts more than 3 months or recurs more than twice in 1 year despite appropriate treatment.\nClinical manifestations and basic lesions of hand eczema can change over time, starting with red spots, edema and blisters. Later progresses to keratosis, fissures and other chronic changes.\nCommon forms of hand eczema include: Irritant contact dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, atopic hand eczema, vesicular hand eczema (leech hives), dermatitis and combinations. other (allergic and irritant contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis...).\nPeople whose hands come into contact with water or chemicals many times a day such as: Sanitation workers, car cleaners, kitchen assistants, food processors, nurses, surgeons, Painters, car repairmen, etc. are people at high risk of occupational hand eczema\nSeborrheic dermatitis\nThis condition occurs in areas of the body that have many oil glands. When it appears on the scalp, it is called dandruff. Seborrheic dermatitis can be the result of a severe reaction caused by high levels of the yeast Malassezia (a common organism found on the skin). Seborrheic dermatitis is also associated with other skin conditions, such as psoriasis, acne, rosacea and many others.\nStasis dermatitis or stasis dermatitis\nThe disease often occurs in people with poor blood circulation, often appearing in the lower legs. Unlike some other types of eczema, inflammation is not linked to genes. Some lifestyle habits can increase the risk of disease such as being overweight and lacking exercise. In addition, some occupations that require standing for long periods of time (teachers, security guards, etc.) or sitting for long periods of time (tailors, drivers, office workers, etc.) are also at high risk of getting this disease.",
