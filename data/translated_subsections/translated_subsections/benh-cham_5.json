Are products that are fragrance-free or for sensitive skin helpful?; What foods should I avoid to avoid flare-ups?; Which fabrics should you avoid/should you wear?; Do pets make symptoms worse?; If sweating makes things worse, can I still exercise?; What happens if symptoms do not improve or a skin infection occurs due to scratching?; Does stress cause disease outbreaks?; How can we reduce the risk of disease outbreaks?",
