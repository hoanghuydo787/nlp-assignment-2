    "subsection_content": "Chlamydia is caused by the bacteria chlamydia trachomatis. This is an intracellular bacterium with a very rapid growth and replication rate. Chlamydia has 3 different variations in clinical and biological manifestations: (3)\nChlamydia psittaci bacteria: commonly found in birds, infects humans causing parrot fever; Chlamydia pneumoniae bacteria: main cause of respiratory diseases; Chlamydia trachomatis bacteria: the main variant that causes sexually transmitted diseases or trachoma.\nChlamydia trachomatis is a special bacterium, an obligate parasite in living cells, spherical in shape, intermediate in size between bacteria and viruses due to its genetic system. Therefore, chlamydia trachomatis can be classified as a virus or bacteria. Chlamydia trachomatis is contained in secretions in the vagina, urethra, and cervix.\nChlamydia is spread from vaginal, oral and anal sex. Vaginal fluid or semen containing chlamydia trachomatis bacteria is transmitted from a sick person to a normal person. Pregnant women can transmit Chlamydia to their babies during birth.\nSome ways to transmit Chlamydia:\nRegular sex: bacteria are transmitted from the penis to the partner's vagina or vice versa.; Anal sex: bacteria are transmitted from the penis to the partner's anus or vice versa.; Oral sex: bacteria are transmitted from the mouth to the partner's penis, vagina, anus or vice versa; Sex with toys: bacteria transfer from the toy to a person's mouth, penis, vagina or anus.; Manual genital or anal stimulation: less commonly, infected vaginal fluid or semen can come into contact with the eyes causing infection (conjunctivitis).",
