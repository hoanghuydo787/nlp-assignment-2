    "subsection_content": "Have! Early stage chlamydia has no obvious signs or symptoms, so the disease is often overlooked. After being re-discovered and treated at a late stage, the disease now had complications.\nSome common complications:\nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID): occurs when bacteria spread to infect the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. PID can cause infertility, ectopic pregnancy or chronic pelvic pain.; Infection near the testicles (epididymitis): causes inflammation, fever, pain, and swelling of the scrotum; Prostate infection: affects the function and quality of the testicles, the sperm produced is not healthy for conception.; Infection in newborns: Chlamydia can be transmitted from the vaginal canal to the fetus. Babies are born at risk of pneumonia or serious eye infections.; Ectopic pregnancy: the fertilized egg implants and develops outside the uterus. Ectopic pregnancies need to be removed to prevent dangerous complications.\nSee details: Is Chlamydia dangerous? 6 serious complications\nWhat should you do when you detect Chlamydia infection?\nIt is necessary to distinguish Chlamydia from other sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea, Candida, etc. because the symptoms often have similarities and differences, making it difficult to diagnose accurately. Therefore, as soon as there are signs of suspected illness, you should quickly go to the hospital for timely consultation, examination and treatment.\nMethods of diagnosing Chlamydia\nWhen there are any suspicious symptoms, you should quickly go to reputable medical facilities for testing, early diagnosis and treatment to increase the chance of cure and minimize dangerous complications. Some tests used to diagnose Chlamydia include:\nNucleic acid amplification test (NAAT): the doctor will take a sample of fluid from the vagina, urethra or urine and send it for testing. This method can be performed with urine samples from both men and women.; Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test: detects Chlamydia antigen using monoclonal antibodies but the sensitivity is not high, reaching about 60% - 85% compared to culture. Specificity can reach 99%.; Enzyme immunoassay (EIA): helps find anti-Chlamydia antibodies in the patient's blood, and at the same time, activates the immune system. The sensitivity of this method reaches 60% - 80%, specificity 97% - 99%.; PCR (Polymerase), LCR (Ligase chain reaction) and TMA: techniques with the highest sensitivity and specificity. Specimens are taken from the cervix, urethra and urine. Specificity reaches 99%, sensitivity ranges from 70% - 100%.",
