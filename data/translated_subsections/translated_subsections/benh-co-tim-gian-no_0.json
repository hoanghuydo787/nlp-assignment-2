    "subsection_content": "Dilated cardiomyopathy, also known as dilated cardiomyopathy, is a disease that affects the ventricles (lower chambers) and atria (upper chambers) of the heart. Usually, the disease begins in the left ventricle - the heart's main pumping chamber. At this time, the left ventricle dilates (enlarges) and weakens, causing the heart's ability to pump blood to decrease - said Huynh Thanh Kieu, M.D., Head of Cardiology Department 1, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City. .\nSimulated image of a healthy heart and a heart with dilated cardiomyopathy\nWhen this situation occurs, the heart chambers respond by stretching to hold more blood, enough to pump it throughout the body. At the same time, the kidneys also respond by increasing the retention of water (fluid) and sodium salts in the body. If fluid accumulates in the liver, ankles, feet, lungs or other organs, it can cause an enlarged liver, swollen legs, difficulty breathing or “congestive heart failure,” which is the term used to describe the condition. this situation.\nNot only does it affect the kidneys, dilated cardiomyopathy can also lead to leaky heart valves, arrhythmias and blood clots in the heart.
