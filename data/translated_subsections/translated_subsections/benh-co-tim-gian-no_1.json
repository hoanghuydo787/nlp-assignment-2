The mechanism of alcohol-induced disease is as follows: Inhibits protein synthesis Inhibits oxidative phosphorylation Free radical damage Accumulates fatty acid esters Disrupts cell membrane structure of heart cells Causes spasms coronary artery Receptor abnormalities in heart cells In addition to cardiomyopathy, long-term alcohol consumption also increases the risk of atrial fibrillation, supraventricular arrhythmia, ventricular extrasystoles, hypertension and stroke.; Inhibits protein synthesis; Inhibits oxidative phosphorylation; Free radical damage; Accumulation of fatty acid esters; Disrupts the cell membrane structure of heart cells; Causes coronary artery spasm; Abnormal receptors in heart cells; In addition to cardiomyopathy, long-term alcohol consumption also increases the risk of atrial fibrillation, supraventricular arrhythmias, ventricular premature beats, hypertension and stroke.; Drug abuse; Tachyarrhythmia; Some cytotoxic drugs or cancer chemotherapy drugs such as: cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, trastuzumab...; Coronary artery disease: When the lumen of the artery that carries blood and oxygen to the heart muscle is blocked, blood flow to the heart muscle is reduced. Over time, the functioning of the heart muscle is affected, causing the heart muscles to not contract properly. All the blood from the left ventricle cannot be pushed out and tends to pool inside, leading to dilation of the left ventricle.; Pregnant women (peripartum cardiomyopathy); Infectious diseases such as leptospirosis, Lyme disease, toxoplasmosis, Q fever, Chagas disease, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus...; Connective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis...\nThere are some cases where the cause cannot be determined, called idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. About one-third of patients have a family history of what is called familial (genetic) dilated cardiomyopathy.",
