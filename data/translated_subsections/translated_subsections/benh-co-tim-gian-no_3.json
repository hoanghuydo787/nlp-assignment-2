    "subsection_content": "MSc. Huynh Thanh Kieu said that dilated cardiomyopathy, if not treated properly, can lead to complications such as:\nHeart valve regurgitation: As the heart enlarges, the valves can become stretched, leading to leaks. This leak puts additional strain on an already damaged heart (mitral regurgitation).; Arrhythmias (such as slow conduction, bundle branch block and tachyarrhythmias, atrial fibrillation): In addition to reducing the body's ability to supply adequate blood, stretched and scarred heart muscles due to cardiomyopathy can lead to leading to abnormal heart rhythms, even life-threatening; Heart failure – the final consequence of the pathogenesis.; Diastolic dysfunction: When the contractile function of the heart muscle is weakened, not only is the squeezing/pumping (systolic) activity impaired, but also the heart's ability to relax to draw blood into the next pumping cycle. This is called diastolic dysfunction.; Pulmonary hypertension: If mitral valve regurgitation worsens, this further impairs the heart's ability to relax between pumping cycles. The heart becomes more tense and blood refluxes into the lungs, leading to pulmonary congestion and pulmonary hypertension.; Edema: central (lung congestion and enlarged liver) and peripheral (edema of organs such as hands, feet, face...).; Thrombus formation: Due to the slow flow created by the impaired pumping action of the heart, blood clots can develop in the heart.; Blood clots are dangerous because they can break off, travel through blood vessels and lodge in the brain or lungs, blocking blood flow and leading to stroke or death.; Sudden cardiac arrest: This complication is likely to occur in 2% of patients.",
