    "subsection_content": "According to MSc. Huynh Thanh Kieu, all treatment methods for dilated cardiomyopathy are aimed at reducing symptoms, improving heart function, and prolonging the patient's life. Depending on the stage of the disease, the doctor will recommend appropriate treatment methods:\n1. Use medicine\nMedications prescribed for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy have the following uses:\nImprove heart function; Treat symptoms and prevent complications\nDepending on the severity of symptoms, patients need a combination of medications such as:\nDiuretics: increases urine output, thereby reducing congestion symptoms, reducing shortness of breath, shrinking the liver and reducing leg swelling; Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)/ARNI group: help dilate blood vessels, thereby helping to lower blood pressure; At the same time, it improves blood flow and reduces the load on the heart.; Beta blockers: slow heart rate and reduce blood pressure; reduces symptoms of heart failure and enhances heart function; Aldosterone antagonists: act as diuretics without disturbing the body's potassium balance.; SGLT2 inhibitors: are new heart failure treatment drugs, prolonging the lives of heart failure patients; Digoxin slows the heart rate and increases the force of contraction.; Blood thinners: prevent the formation of blood clots related to blood clotting if the patient has atrial fibrillation or blood clots in the heart chambers.\n2. Place the implant\nIn some cardiomyopathy patients, doctors will prescribe implantable devices to improve symptoms. Two types of devices commonly used are:\nCardiac resynchronization device (CRT): For patients with advanced heart failure, biventricular pacemakers help the right and left ventricles contract more synchronized, improving symptoms as well as increasing exercise capacity. In people with heart block or bradycardia, this device will also help maintain proper heart rhythm.; Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD): ICDs are recommended for people at risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias or sudden death. The ICD's job is to continuously monitor heart rhythm. When it detects a very fast or abnormal heart rhythm (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation), it will provide an electrical current to the heart muscle to clear the arrhythmia, returning the heart to a normal rhythm.\nIn many cases, both types of implants can be combined in one device, called a CRT-D.\n3. Surgery\nIf all measures such as medication and implants are not effective in treating the disease, the doctor will consider surgical options, including:\nTemporary surgery: repair or replace the mitral valve if there is severe mitral valve regurgitation. However, the effect it brings is only to improve symptoms and not change the nature of the disease.; ECMO (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation): also known as cardiopulmonary bypass, placed on patients with acute heart failure or cardiogenic shock while waiting for the heart muscle to recover.; Mechanical left ventricular assist device (LVAD): a device that is temporarily implanted to perform the pumping function of the left ventricle while waiting for a heart transplant or waiting for the heart muscle to recover in myocarditis.; Heart transplant: Normally, this method is only for people with end-stage heart failure. Patients will have a chance to live more than 1 year (90% rate) and more than 20 years (>50% rate) after heart transplant surgery.\n4. Change your lifestyle\nMSc. Huynh Thanh Kieu said that a healthy lifestyle is the key to solving all health problems, including cardiovascular disease. Therefore, adhering to a reasonable diet and exercise regimen will contribute to improving symptoms of dilated cardiomyopathy:\nQuit drinking alcohol if the cause of the disease is determined due to alcohol; Do not smoke to reduce the risk of coronary artery stenosis or coronary artery spasm; Do not become pregnant again if peripartum (pregnancy-related) dilated cardiomyopathy is confirmed; Stop or reduce the dose of cytotoxic drugs and cancer treatment drugs that are toxic to the myocardium; Diet: Once symptoms such as shortness of breath or fatigue appear, you should limit your salt intake to 2,000 - 3,000 mg per day. Even when symptoms have subsided, you should still maintain a bland diet. To do that, you should try to cook at home, cut out all processed foods such as sausages, bacon, ham, etc., and carefully check food labels to control the amount of salt. tolerated by the body; Exercise: Your doctor will advise you whether you can exercise or not. Most people with cardiomyopathy are encouraged to do light exercises and avoid combat sports.\nSee more:Â Can dilated cardiomyopathy be cured? The treatments",
