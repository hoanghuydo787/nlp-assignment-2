    "subsection_content": "Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the protein of the myocardial sarcomere structure. Patients will have a thickened heart wall, which may progress to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, mitral valve regurgitation, diastolic dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, and arrhythmia. This is also the reason why patients experience symptoms such as fatigue, chest pain, pulmonary edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fainting, pre-syncope and even sudden death.\nBased on the morphology and function of the heart, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is divided into:\nObstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: About 60 - 70% of cases are in this form. Patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have a thicker septum between the left and right ventricles, causing obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract and reduced blood flow through the heart.; Non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: About 1/3 of the remaining cases are non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The patient does not have reduced blood flow through the heart, however, the patient's left ventricle may become thicker and stiffer, reducing the blood volume of the left ventricle, thereby reducing the amount of blood pumped out of the heart to feed the body. .",
