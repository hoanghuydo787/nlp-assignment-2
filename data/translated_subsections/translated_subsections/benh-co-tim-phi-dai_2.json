This is why the disease is often detected at a late stage, when life-threatening complications arise.\nNormally, signs of myocardial hypertrophy will appear clearly when the heart's pumping function is significantly impaired. Patients may experience symptoms such as:\nDifficulty breathing, especially with exertion; Sharp chest pain, especially during physical activity; Fainting, this is a sign of ventricular tachyarrhythmia or ventricular fibrillation, with a risk of sudden death.; Palpitations.\nThe disease is very dangerous because the first and last symptom of the disease can be sudden death.",
