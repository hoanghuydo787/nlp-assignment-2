Therefore, when one family member is diagnosed with the disease, it is recommended that all remaining family members undergo genetic testing and screening to find the mutated gene that causes the disease.\nThe cause of the disease in the elderly may be due to high blood pressure but not treated early and effectively. Some other causes may include:\nTypes secondary to systolic overload: Hypertension Coarctation of the aorta Abnormalities in the submitral apparatus Aortic stenosis Transient form Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in newborns due to maternal diabetes Corticosteroids in the child new-born; Hypertension; Aortic coarctation; Abnormalities in the submitral valve apparatus; Main stenosis; Transient form; Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in newborns due to maternal diabetes; Corticosteroids in infants; Multiple organ disorders with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Noonan syndrome Glycogen metabolism disease Friedreich's disease Abnormalities in the oxidation of fatty acids Deficiency of the oxidative chain within the mitochondria; Noonan syndrome; Glycogen metabolism disease; Friedreich's disease; Abnormalities in the oxidation of fatty acids; Oxidative chain deficiency within mitochondria",
