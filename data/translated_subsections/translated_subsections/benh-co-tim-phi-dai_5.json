    "subsection_content": "If not detected early and treated promptly and properly, patients are at risk of facing the following dangerous complications:\nArrhythmia: This disease can lead to atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. In particular, atrial fibrillation is the cause of increased blood clot formation, causing myocardial infarction and stroke. Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation are common causes of cardiac arrest and sudden death; Myocardial ischemia: Thickening of the heart muscle causes blood flow through the coronary arteries to decrease, leading to lack of blood supply to the heart muscle.; Myocardial dilatation: Prolonged illness can cause the ventricles to dilate to increase blood volume, gradually reducing the contractility of the myocardium.; Mitral valve regurgitation: The mitral valve is the valve that separates the left atrium and left ventricle. In the case of thickening of the heart muscle, the space for blood to circulate is reduced, blood flows through the heart valve quickly and rapidly, increasing the pressure of blood flow on the heart valve, affecting the functioning of the mitral valve, causing regurgitation. valve.; Heart failure: Thickening of the heart muscle will cause the heart to reduce its ability to pump blood to meet the body's needs, resulting in heart failure.",
