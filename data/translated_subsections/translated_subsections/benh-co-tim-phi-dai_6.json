Next, the doctor may ask the patient to perform some paraclinical tests such as:\nEchocardiogram: Shows changes in the thickness of the heart muscle and obstructed blood flow.; Electrocardiography (ECG): Detects abnormal electrical signals of the heart, warning that the heart muscle is thickening.\nEchocardiography and electrocardiography are necessary tests in cases of suspected signs of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\nIn addition, the doctor may ask the patient to perform a number of other tests such as testing heart function during exercise, magnetic resonance imaging, and cardiac catheterization to get accurate results, thereby determining the treatment regimen. appropriate and effective treatment.",
