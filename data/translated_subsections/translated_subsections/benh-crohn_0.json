Common symptoms of Crohn's disease are abdominal pain, diarrhea and severe malnutrition due to deep ulcers on the intestinal wall.\nThe treatment regimen for regional chronic enteritis depends on the type of inflammation, the cause of the disease and the clinical context of each person. The 3 main forms of the disease, corresponding to each serious stage of the disease, include:\nInflammatory phase; Stage of intestinal stenosis and obstruction; The phase penetrates the wall or creates a fistula in the intestinal wall\nThis is a dangerous digestive disease, capable of progressing into complications that greatly affect the health and life of the patient.
