    "subsection_content": "The specific cause of Crohn's disease has not yet been determined. Food and mental health issues are not the main causes of the disease. However, these are factors that increase the severity of the disease, stimulating the disease to progress to later stages faster than usual.\nFurthermore, Crohn's disease is classified as an autoimmune disease, meaning that the disease is caused by the body's autoimmune response.\nOther causes believed to be the cause of regional chronic enteritis include: the immune system, family medical history, quality of living environment and diet.\n1. Immune system\nCommon causes come from the immune system. Autoimmune disease is a disease that occurs when the patient's body loses the ability to recognize antigens and disease-causing bacteria that invade from the outside. From there, instead of needing to fight harmful bacteria and viruses, they attack the organs in the body. Regional chronic enteritis is one of the common types of autoimmune diseases. In addition, people with Crohn's disease due to this cause will also have symptoms related to arthritis.\n2. Genetics\nFamily genetics can cause or increase the risk of Crohn's disease, including regional chronic inflammatory bowel disease. According to 2022 statistics, the proportion of people with hereditary Crohn's disease in the family is 15%. This is a noteworthy number for those who have relatives who have had the disease, because their likelihood of getting Crohn's disease is quite high.\n3. The quality of the living environment does not meet standards\nA substandard living environment is the direct cause of infectious and inflammatory diseases, including regional chronic enteritis. Living areas, especially houses with poor hygiene quality and potential pathogens from harmful bacteria and viruses, are considered a substandard living environment. Frequent contact will cause many diseases.\n4. Diet\nSimilar to the factor of substandard living environment, consuming foods that do not ensure hygienic quality increases the risk of infections and inflammation caused by harmful bacteria and viruses...",
