The doctor will base on the clinical symptoms the patient has and make a general assessment. After that, continue to prescribe the patient to perform paraclinical tests to be able to make the correct conclusion about the type of Crohn's disease and the patient's stage.(2)\nParaclinical diagnostic activities for regional chronic enteritis include:\nBlood tests: Check erythrocyte sedimentation rate, reactive proteins, inflammatory factors and blood chemistry results.; Blood tests: Check erythrocyte sedimentation rate, reactive proteins, inflammatory factors and blood chemistry results.\nStool test: Checking parasites, red blood cells, white blood cells and procaltectin in stool is a marker that reflects the level of intestinal inflammation; Stool test: Checking parasites, red blood cells, white blood cells and procaltectin in the stool is a marker that reflects the level of intestinal inflammation\nStomach and colonoscopy: is the first method to directly access lesions in the upper and lower digestive tract, biopsiing suspected lesions to help accurately diagnose Crohn's disease; Stomach and colonoscopy: is the first method to directly access lesions in the upper and lower digestive tract, biopsy suspected lesions to help accurately diagnose Crohn's disease\nSmall bowel transit scan with contrast: Imaging diagnostic method, allowing doctors to see lesions of the small intestine such as stone slices, narrow intestinal segments.; Contrast-enhanced small bowel transit scan: An imaging diagnostic method that allows doctors to see small bowel lesions such as stone slabs and narrow intestinal tracts.\nCT scan to identify patients with complications such as abdominal abscess, fistula in the intestine - bladder or intestine - ureter...; CT scan to identify patients with complications such as abdominal abscess, fistula in the intestine - bladder or intestine - ureter...\nPathology: helps analyze inflammatory cells on biopsy lesions from endoscopy to accurately diagnose the disease.; Pathology: helps analyze inflammatory cells on biopsy lesions from endoscopy to accurately diagnose the disease.\nNext, based on the results from the definitive diagnosis, the doctor will continue to differentiate Crohn's disease from two main groups of diseases: small bowel disease in the ileocecal region and other related colon diseases.\nThe final step is to accurately diagnose the disease by combining means, assessing the patient's severity and complications. Complications that patients may experience are:\nPerforation, fistula or intestinal abscess; Intestinal stenosis; Pathologies around the rectum such as fistula, hemorrhoids, excess skin...; Cancer occurs in the later stages of the disease.",
