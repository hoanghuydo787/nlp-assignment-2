    "subsection_content": "1. Intestinal obstruction\nIntestinal obstruction is a common complication that develops from Crohn's disease. The patient will experience significant mechanical deterioration, and even the process of transporting substances inside the intestine will be completely stopped because of the obstruction. Recognizable symptoms include flatulence and defecation, vomiting, and cramping.\n2. Ulcers\nSmall intestine and colon ulcers are complications caused by regional chronic enteritis. The disease causes chronic transmural inflammation anywhere in the digestive system. The most common locations are the ileum, intestines and colon. This is also considered a premise leading to complications of small intestine and colon ulcers.\n3. Fistula\nFistula is one of the dangerous complications of Crohn's disease because the disease is difficult to completely cure. In addition, fistulas also have a very negative impact on the patient's immune system, increasing the risk of infection as well as slowing down the treatment process.\nThis complication is the abnormal drainage of fluid, pus, or inflamed tissue from the digestive system to other organs. If the disease is not treated promptly, the fistulas may spread to the skin outside the abdominal area or into the internal organs in the patient's abdomen.\n4. Anal fissures\nAnal fissures are caused by regional chronic inflammatory bowel disease, diagnosed by tissue tears in the anal area or surrounding skin. This complication can increase the patient's risk of infection because this crack is an easy place to come into contact with disease-causing bacteria, making it easy for them to enter the body.\nPatients with anal fissures will experience pain when defecating. If not detected and treated immediately, the disease will develop into complications of anal fistula.\n5. Colon cancer\nColon cancer is a possible complication, especially in elderly patients. According to statistics, Crohn's disease has a fairly low mortality rate, hardly causing direct death. However, the disease is a factor that increases the risk of digestive cancer and colon cancer when damage in this area lasts for a long time. Especially for older people with weak resistance, they will face a high risk of death if chronic inflammatory bowel disease progresses to complications of colon cancer.\n6. Deep vein thrombosis\nDeep vein thrombosis, also known as a blood clot that appears in a deep or pelvic vein, is caused by Crohn's disease. The disease can cause blood clots to appear in the veins of the calves, thighs or pelvic areas as a complication that patients need to watch out for. Complications will cause endothelial damage, dysfunction or hyperactivity in the patient.\n7. Malnutrition\nCrohn's disease is a disease of the digestive tract, so the symptoms that the patient experiences, including abdominal cramps, body fever and urinary disorders, will lead to a feeling of fatigue, significantly decreasing. the feeling of wanting to eat. Seriously, the body cannot fully absorb the nutrients that the patient ingests. If this condition persists for a long time and does not progress, it will lead to malnutrition in the patient.",
