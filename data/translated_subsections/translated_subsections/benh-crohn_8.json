    "subsection_content": "1. Is Crohn's disease contagious?\nCrohn's disease cannot be transmitted from person to person. Regardless of the cause, Crohn's disease is not transmitted to others, even through sex.\n2. Is Crohn's disease dangerous?\nCrohn's disease is a dangerous digestive disease. First of all, this is a chronic disease, requiring the patient to carry out serious treatment in combination with instructions from the doctor for a long time.\nIf the disease is not detected and treated early, the inflammation will spread to other parts, causing the patient's symptoms to become severe and his health to be significantly weakened. Furthermore, Crohn's disease in later stages also increases the risk of other complications, which are life-threatening digestive diseases such as intestinal obstruction and colon cancer.\n3. What should people with Crohn's disease pay attention to in their diet and activities?\nCrohn's disease patients need a reasonable dietary supplement. In general, the diet needs to be balanced between substances and limit the absorption of bad fats. Furthermore, patients also need to limit the use of animal milk products containing lactose.\nFor people with Crohn's disease with complications of intestinal fibrosis, they should eat a low-residue diet. People with inflammation in the small intestine, or severely damaged small intestine, should limit fatty foods and greasy foods.\nPatients' families should note that, except in cases prescribed by specialized doctors, receiving nutrition by mouth will bring optimal results to the patient, rather than by intravenous infusion.",
