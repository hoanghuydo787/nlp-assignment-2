    "subsection_content": "Influenza is an acute viral infection. The disease develops when the flu virus infects and attacks the respiratory system such as the nose, throat, bronchial tubes, and possibly the lungs.\nInfluenza is mostly mild and patients can recover on their own in about 2-7 days. However, in some special cases such as immunocompromised people, people with chronic diseases, etc. flu can become dangerous and cause serious complications that can lead to death.\nInfluenza can attack everyone, in adults the rate is 5-10%, in children it is 20-30%. The dangerous point of influenza is its high infectiousness, leading to the risk of an outbreak. In tropical regions like Vietnam, influenza often occurs during the rainy season but can still spread at any time of the year.\nThere are 3 different types of flu that affect humans, including: (1)\nInfluenza A: Also known as seasonal flu, found in many animals. Influenza A viruses frequently change, creating many new strains; known to cause highly infectious influenza pandemics. Currently circulating influenza A subtypes include A (H1N1) and A (H3N2).; Influenza B: Like influenza A, influenza B viruses can also cause seasonal outbreaks. Regarding differences, influenza B viruses generally change more slowly in their genetic and antigenic properties than influenza A. Influenza B viruses only cause disease in humans and are not divided by type like influenza A; nor does it cause large waves of infection.; Influenza C: Influenza C virus is also found in humans but causes illness with milder respiratory symptoms than influenza A and B and less dangerous complications.\nInfluenza includes 3 types, of which influenza A is considered the cause of many pandemics",
