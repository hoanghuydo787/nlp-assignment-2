    "subsection_content": "Flu can cause symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Many people often confuse the flu with a cold because of the initial symptoms such as runny nose, sneezing and sore throat. However, colds often develop slowly, while flu develops quickly and suddenly. You may start to notice signs of illness between 1-7 days, usually 48-72 hours after exposure to the flu virus.\nThe first common symptom is a high fever from 39 to 41 degrees Celsius. Children with the flu will often have a higher fever than adults. People with flu may also experience one or more of the following signs: (2)\nfeeling chills, sweating; Dry cough; Sore throat; Stuffy nose, runny nose; Headache; Fatigue, shortness of breath; Vomiting, diarrhea (more common in children than adults)\nMost flu symptoms will gradually disappear after about 4-7 days. The dry cough and fatigue mostly last for weeks in addition to having a fever that comes back again and again.\nIf flu symptoms gradually get worse or persist, with no signs of getting better after 1 week – fever lasts more than 3 days – you need to see a doctor. What is more dangerous is when the patient feels difficulty breathing, chest tightness, loss of consciousness, convulsions, or signs of dehydration (such as little urination, no urination) - at this time the patient needs to be taken to the emergency room immediately. These are warning signs that the flu may be turning into a more serious illness such as pneumonia.",
