    "subsection_content": "The first step in diagnosis is that the doctor will find out and consider flu symptoms, if any.\nIn addition, there are a number of tests to detect influenza virus in respiratory specimens such as:\nRT-PCR: Is the highly specific and most specific method to test and classify influenza viruses. This method produces results within 4-6 hours.; Immunofluorescence: Has lower sensitivity and specificity than RT-PCR method, but produces results after only a few hours of receiving the specimen.; Rapid tests (RIDTs): Have results after 10-15 minutes but are not as accurate as other flu tests, so you can still have the flu even though the rapid test result is negative. The performance of the test depends heavily on the patient's age, duration of illness, specimen type and influenza virus strain. Rapid tests have low sensitivity and specificity, so they need to be combined with other diagnostic testing methods when rapid test results are negative.; Virus isolation: Not a screening test, but during active influenza disease should be performed on specimens collected from people suspected of having influenza, especially those with epidemiological factors for influenza. .; Serum test: The test gives quick results, but the sensitivity and specificity are not high.\nDepending on the type of diagnostic test, the time of specimen collection, the type and quality of the specimen, etc., as well as the active form of the virus, you may still be infected with influenza even though the test result is negative. negative – this situation is called a false negative test. Therefore, reaching the final conclusion still needs to rely on symptoms and clinical assessment from the doctor.\nIn the current situation, people with flu may need additional testing for COVID-19 to rule out the possibility of being infected with flu and COVID-19 at the same time.",
