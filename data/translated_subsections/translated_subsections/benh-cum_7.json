Do not smoke or drink alcohol during this time; You should also limit tea, coffee, drinks with stimulants, etc. to avoid making the body more tired.\nRegarding nutrition, people with flu should increase and supplement dark green, red and yellow vegetables and fruits to enhance the immune system and support quick health recovery.\nUse pain relievers\nTaking over-the-counter pain relievers should be considered. Children and adolescents recovering from flu-like symptoms should not take aspirin to prevent the risk of Reye's syndrome - a condition of acute brain damage and fatty liver following an acute viral infection.\nPeople with flu can use over-the-counter cold medicines, drops or sprays to relieve some unpleasant flu symptoms such as cough, runny nose, headache, etc.\nTake antiviral medications\nFor people with severe infections or at high risk of complications, using antiviral drugs is a necessary flu treatment method. Taking medication promptly and correctly helps reduce the severity of symptoms and shorten the duration of infection. This is also a way to prevent flu complications from developing – especially in older adults or people with weakened immune systems.\nThere are currently 3 antiviral medications recommended for flu treatment: oseltamivir (Tamiflu®), zanamivir (Relenza®) and peramivir (Rapivab®). These drugs work by disrupting the neuraminidase enzyme function on the surface of the virus and preventing the release of virus particles from infected host cells.\nThese antiviral drugs can be used for influenza A and B cases and are most effective within 48 hours after the person begins to have flu symptoms. Therefore early diagnosis and treatment is extremely important.\nTaking antiviral drugs can cause side effects such as nausea and vomiting in some people. Patients should take the medicine while eating to reduce these side effects.\nAntibiotics\nAntibiotics are not effective in treating flu because they cannot kill the virus that causes the disease.\nHowever, flu can weaken the immune system, making the patient more susceptible to other bacterial infections, so in case you notice the flu returning after it has subsided, you should have your health checked as soon as possible. as soon as possible.
