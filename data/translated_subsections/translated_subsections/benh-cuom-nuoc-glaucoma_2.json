    "subsection_content": "Glaucoma occurs when an imbalance in the production and drainage of fluid in the eye (aqueous humor) increases eye pressure to levels that are unhealthy for the eye. Normally, the fluid that nourishes the eye is produced by the ciliary muscle behind the iris (in the posterior chamber) and passes through the pupil to the front of the eye (anterior chamber), where it drains into the midiris canal. eye and cornea (anterior chamber angle). The balance between production and drainage of aqueous humor keeps the aqueous humor flowing freely and prevents intraocular pressure from rising.\nIn Glaucoma, the drainage channels become blocked or clogged. Aqueous fluid cannot exit the eye even though new aqueous humor is being produced in the posterior chamber, causing pressure within the eye to increase. When the pressure becomes higher than what the optic nerve can withstand, the optic nerve becomes damaged. This lesion is called Glaucoma.\nSometimes eye pressure increases within the normal range but is still too high for the optic nerve to tolerate (called low pressure glaucoma or normal  pressure glaucoma).\nIn most cases, the cause of glaucoma cannot be found and is called primary glaucoma. When the cause of the disease is found, it is called secondary Glaucoma. Causes of secondary glaucoma include infection, inflammation, tumors, large cataracts, cataract surgery, medications, or other medical conditions. These causes prevent aqueous humor from escaping, leading to glaucoma and optic nerve damage.",
