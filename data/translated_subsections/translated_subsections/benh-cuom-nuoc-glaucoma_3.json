In open-angle glaucoma, the ducts in the trabecular region gradually become clogged with tiny deposits over months or years; although the anterior chamber angle remains open, drainage of aqueous humor is still inadequate. Pressure in the eye increases slowly because aqueous humor is produced at a normal rate but drains slowly. (2)\nClosed angle glaucoma\nIn angle-closure glaucoma, the trabecular ducts are blocked or obscured because the angle between the iris and cornea is too narrow. The blockage can happen suddenly (called acute angle-closure glaucoma), the pressure in the eye will rise quickly, or gradually (called chronic angle-closure glaucoma), the pressure in the eye will rise slowly as in open-angle glaucoma.",
