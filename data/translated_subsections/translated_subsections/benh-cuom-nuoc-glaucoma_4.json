    "subsection_content": "Open angle glaucoma does not cause pain. Both eyes are usually affected but not usually equally. The main symptom is the development of blind spots, or patches of vision loss, over months to years. The blind spots slowly grow larger and merge with each other. Peripheral vision is often lost first. Patients may slip up stairs, notice parts of words missing when reading, or have difficulty driving. Vision loss occurs gradually so it often goes unnoticed until it is significantly reduced. Because central vision is often lost eventually, there is “tunnel vision”: they see perfectly straight ahead but are blind in all other directions. If left untreated, tunnel vision is eventually lost and a person becomes completely blind.\nIn acute angle-closure Glaucoma, eye pressure increases rapidly and patients often notice severe eye pain and headaches, redness, blurred vision, rainbow-colored halos around lights, and sudden loss of vision. They may also experience nausea and vomiting as a response to glaucoma. Acute angle-closure glaucoma is considered an emergency because people can lose vision as quickly as 2 to 3 hours after symptoms appear if the condition is not treated.\nIn chronic angle-closure glaucoma, intraocular pressure increases slowly and symptoms often begin as in open-angle glaucoma. Some people may experience red eyes, discomfort, blurred vision, or reduced headaches while sleeping. Eye pressure may be normal but is often higher in the affected eye.\nPeople who have had open-angle glaucoma or closed-angle glaucoma in one eye are likely to develop it in the other eye.",
