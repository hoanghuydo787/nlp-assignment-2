So doctors also use an ophthalmoscope and sometimes other instruments (such as optical coherence tomography) to look for changes in the optic nerve that indicate damage from glaucoma. cause.\nAdditionally, visual field testing allows the doctor to detect blind spots, with a machine that determines the ability to see small dots of light in all areas of the visual field. (3)\nThrough eye examination tools, the doctor will assess the progression of the disease to provide appropriate treatment\nAnterior chamber angle examination allows the doctor to determine whether the glaucoma is open-angle or closed-angle.\nDoctors also measure the thickness of the cornea. If the cornea is thin, Glaucoma is more likely to develop. However, a thin cornea does not mean you have Glaucoma.",
