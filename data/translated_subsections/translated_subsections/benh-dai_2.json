    "subsection_content": "Rabies is present all over the world, especially in Asia, Africa and South America, caused by many types of mammals: Dogs, cats, bats, foxes, raccoons, skunks, mongooses, etc. 99% of people with rabies are infected from domestic dogs.\nAnimals infected with rabies will transmit the virus to humans or other animals through bites or scratches. Sick animals can even transmit the virus through saliva when they lick mucous membranes or open wounds on human skin.\nAfter being infected with the virus, the incubation period for rabies is on average 2-3 months but can be as short as 1 week or last up to 1 year. The disease manifests early or late depending on factors such as the location of virus entry and viral load. For example, if a rabid dog bites the head, face, neck, etc. near the central nervous system, the incubation period is short, but if it bites the hands and feet, the disease will take longer to develop.\nRabies can be transmitted from person to person through bites or saliva, but actual cases have not been confirmed. Theoretically, the rabies virus can also be transmitted to people who eat raw meat or milk from animals infected with rabies.",
