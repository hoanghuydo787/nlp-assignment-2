Because if you are accidentally infected with the rabies virus and do not treat it promptly, after about 3 - 12 weeks, symptoms of rabies may appear; Even signs of rabies can start earlier or later. And dangerously, when rabies symptoms appear, people with rabies almost die. (2)\nRabies has two forms: rabies and paralysis.\nSymptoms of rabies\nSymptoms of rabies may include: High fever, headache, unusual or unexplained tingling, stinging or burning sensation (paresthesias) at the site of the bite.\nA few days later, as the virus attacked the central nervous system, inflammation of the brain and spinal cord began to progress. At this time, the patient may show some symptoms such as: Restlessness, anxiety, fear of water, fear of wind, hallucinations (seeing or hearing things), confusion, aggressive behavior, muscle spasms muscle cramps, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, excessive salivation, foaming in the mouth, paralysis, cardiac arrest, apnea, death.\nSymptoms of paralytic rabies\nIn the group of people with rabies, paralysis only accounts for about 20% of cases. The patient shows signs of muscle paralysis, starting at the wound site. The paralyzed muscles gradually become paralyzed, starting from a bite or scratch. Coma slowly develops, and eventually death occurs. The paralytic form of rabies is often misdiagnosed, contributing to underreporting of the disease.\nPlease watch more videos about the causes, symptoms of rabies and how to handle dog bites:",
