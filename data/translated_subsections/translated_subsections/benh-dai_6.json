Globally, 40% of people bitten by animals suspected of having rabies are children under 15 years old.\nEvery year, more than 29 million people around the world are vaccinated to prevent after being bitten or scratched by animals. Thanks to early prophylactic vaccination, it is estimated that hundreds of thousands of deaths due to rabies are prevented each year.\nVaccinating dogs against rabies is an effective way to prevent rabies\nEliminate rabies in dogs\nMore than 90% of rabies cases occur from domestic dogs. Therefore, the most important and basic thing to prevent rabies is to first vaccinate pets (dogs, cats, etc.) against rabies. Rabies is completely preventable with vaccine. Vaccinating dogs is the most cost-effective and effective strategy to prevent rabies in humans and protect pets. (4)\nRaise awareness about rabies\nInfections cause tens of thousands of deaths each year, mainly in Asia and Africa. Therefore, educating each person and the community to vaccinate pets and increase awareness of the dangers of the virus that causes rabies will limit the death rate. At the same time, every family when raising pets, especially domestic dogs, must comply with the law on preventing the risk of dogs biting people, grasp first aid knowledge when bitten by dogs, etc.\nPrevent dog bites\nDogs need to be muzzled and leashed when taking them out on the street. If you encounter a ferocious dog, do not run away because it awakens the dog's hunting instinct. You stand still, put your hands on both sides in a tree-like position and look away, many dogs will lose interest because they are ignored. If your pet starts biting you, you must defend yourself by hitting or kicking the dog's throat, nose and nape to stun it and give you time to escape. Use your entire body weight to press down on the animal, using your knees and elbows to press down firmly.\nVaccination of people\nPeople working in certain fields need to be vaccinated to prevent exposure such as: Medical staff who come into contact with people with rabies, laboratory technicians handling rabies virus (lyssavirus), and inspection staff. Animal disease control, wildlife rangers, people who have direct contact with bats, predators or other mammals may be infected.\nSome people who travel \"backpacking\" and people in areas where the disease is endemic should also be vaccinated against rabies exposure. Finally, children who play with pets, especially when bitten, licked, etc. by pets, must have their wounds treated and vaccinated against rabies immediately.",
