    "subsection_content": "Trigeminal neuralgia (TN), also known as trigeminal nerve or cranial nerve V (one of the most widely distributed nerves in the head), is a painful, chronic condition. trigeminal nerve involvement.\nTrigeminal nerve pain often appears on one side of the face, gradually spreading to other areas on the same side\nPain can appear when there is slight stimulation to the face such as brushing teeth, shaving, chewing food, applying makeup... It feels like being electrocuted or being stabbed in the face with a sharp object. It starts with short, mild pain, but over time, the pain becomes more intense, longer lasting, and more frequent. Pain appears on one side of the face and spreads along the cheekbones, nose, upper lip, upper teeth and/or spreads to the lower part of the cheekbones, lips and lower jaw. The forehead and orbital areas are less common. Most people with this condition experience cyclical symptoms: the pain comes and goes for days or weeks, then gradually subsides. In some cases, the condition becomes more severe and pain occurs more often.\nThere is no specific test for the TN condition, so diagnosis can take time. Treatment depends on the cause and severity of the pain. Several medications are available to help relieve pain and reduce the number of attacks, but more severe conditions will require surgery.\nTrigeminal neuralgia can be divided into two types:\nThe typical form of the disorder (known as “Type 1” or TN1) causes severe, sporadic, sudden, or shock-like facial pain; lasting from a few seconds to two minutes at a time. These pains can occur in rapid succession, in waves lasting up to two hours.; The “atypical” form of the disorder (known as “Type 2” or TN2), is characterized by constant, burning, throbbing pain of less intensity than Type 1. Both types of pain can be happens in the same person, sometimes at the same time. The intensity of the pain can affect physical and mental activities.",
