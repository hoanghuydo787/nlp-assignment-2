    "subsection_content": "The structure of the trigeminal nerve includes 3 parts: sensory, motor and small branches. The trigeminal nerve is one of 12 pairs of nerves attached to the brain. There are two separate trigeminal nerves, located on each side of the face. These nerves are responsible for pain in the face and other sensations. Each nerve has three branches that transmit sensation from the ophthalmic branch (upper branch), the maxillary branch (middle branch) and the mandibular branch (lower branch) of the face and oral cavity, to the brain.\nThe eye branch provides sensation to most of the scalp, forehead and around the eyes.; The maxillary branch stimulates the cheeks, upper jaw, upper lip, teeth, gums, and side of the nose.; The mandibular branch supplies nerves to the lower jaw, teeth, gums, and lower lip.\nMore than one nerve branch may be affected by this disorder. Rarely, pain occurs on both sides of the face at the same time (called bilateral trigeminal neuralgia) and occurs at different times.",
