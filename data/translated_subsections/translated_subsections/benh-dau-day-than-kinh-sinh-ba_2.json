Rarely the symptoms of TN are caused by nerve compression from a tumor, or a plexus of arteries and veins called an arteriovenous malformation.; Due to trauma: Damage to the trigeminal nerve (which can be the result of sinus surgery, oral surgery, stroke or facial trauma) is also considered a cause of facial pain.",
