    "subsection_content": "Diagnosis of TN is mainly based on factors: patient history, symptoms, physical and neurological examination results. This is to determine which part of the trigeminal nerve is being affected. Your doctor will also touch different parts of your face to determine the location of the pain. Other disorders that cause facial pain should be ruled out before diagnosing TN, which are:\nPostherpetic neuralgia (nerve pain after a shingles outbreak); Cluster headaches; Temporomandibular joint disorder (causing pain and dysfunction of the jaw joint, the muscles that control jaw movement)\nBecause symptoms often overlap and there are many causes of pain, it is difficult to accurately diagnose the disease. However, finding the cause of pain is important because treatment will be different for each type of pain.\nThe modern MRI system at Tam Anh General Hospital in HCM promotes its use in diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia.\nTo accurately diagnose the condition, tests may be ordered to rule out the above causes of pain. The most appropriate technique in this case is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to rule out tumors or multiple sclerosis. MRI images will give the answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" to the condition of a blood vessel compressing a nerve. MRI scanning technique can also show the severity of nerve compression by blood vessels (if any).",
