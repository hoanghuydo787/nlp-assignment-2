    "subsection_content": "Monkeypox is a rare disease, caused by a virus related to the common smallpox. People with the disease often have symptoms such as rash, fever, headache, etc.\nMedical literature records cases of monkeypox transmitted directly through contact with infected people (contact with bedding, clothes, towels, secretions, respiratory droplets, etc.). Medical literature has not confirmed whether monkeypox is sexually transmitted or not. However, information from WHO records that the disease appears in some men who have sex with men. Children and adults are also susceptible to the disease.\nMost infected people recover within a few weeks, and the death rate is not high. However, risk factors leading to severe disease progression and high mortality include: infected people with long-term exposure to the virus, children, people with weak immune systems, etc.\nScientists say this disease is more difficult to spread than the Covid-19 epidemic. However, monkeypox can still become a global health threat if there is no timely vaccine.",
