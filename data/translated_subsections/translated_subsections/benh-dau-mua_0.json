    "subsection_content": "Smallpox (Variola) is an infectious disease caused by the variola virus, characterized by fever, rash and high mortality rate. When viruses attack the body, they incubate for an average of 7 - 17 days. Usually, about 10 - 14 days after being infected with the virus, the first symptoms appear such as: Sudden high fever up to 40 degrees Celsius, headache, severe back pain, extreme fatigue, vomiting, etc.\nThen, rashes appear on the face, hands, forearms and spread throughout the body. In just 1-2 days, the rash develops into small blisters, initially filled with clear fluid and turning into pus. Blisters can develop in the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth. After about 8-9 days, the blisters scab over and fall off, leaving deep, round scars.\nSmallpox appeared around 10,000 BC with evidence of pustules on the mummy of Pharaoh Ramses V in ancient Egypt. In the late 18th century, this disease killed about 400,000 Europeans each year, of whom more than 80% were children. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 1976, globally, 15 million people were infected with smallpox, of which 2 million died. In 1979, the world repelled the smallpox epidemic, marking one of the greatest achievements of modern medicine. (first)\nA drawing included in Book",
