    "subsection_content": "Smallpox has two clinical epidemiological forms: mild smallpox (alastrim) and severe smallpox (smallpox). However, based on symptoms alone, it is impossible to distinguish mild smallpox from severe smallpox. New modern molecular diagnostic techniques are capable of distinguishing between the two strains of variola. (2)\n1. Severe smallpox (smallpox)\nSevere smallpox is caused by the Variola major virus strain, with a high mortality rate. People who have not been vaccinated against smallpox have a 40% risk of death, usually between days 2 and 2 of the disease. About 3% of patients experience severe symptoms: exhaustion, bleeding under the skin, mucous membranes, uterus... In particular, pregnant women with severe smallpox have a high risk of death. Therefore, pregnant mothers need to limit contact in crowded places, travel to epidemic areas and always ensure a nutritious diet to improve the body's immunity and protect mother and baby.\n2. Mild smallpox (alalastrim)\nThe Variola Minor virus strain is also known as Variola alastrim and is another virus that causes mild smallpox. Variola Minor virus attacks and causes a rash on the face, then spreads to the hands, body and legs (more common on the face). Similar to severe smallpox, mild smallpox also has acute onset symptoms such as fever, headache, and back pain. However, mild smallpox usually causes superficial lesions and heals more quickly. Mild smallpox causes a mortality rate of less than 1%.",
