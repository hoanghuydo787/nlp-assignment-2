    "subsection_content": "Smallpox has many clinical forms, including: mild form, common form, malignant form, hemorrhagic form with different symptoms and severity. (3)\n1. Mild smallpox\nMild smallpox has less severe symptoms, patients rarely have bleeding, and is common in vaccinated patients. When infected, the patient has a fever but no rash. Sick people are less likely to spread it to others but should still practice good isolation measures. However, many cases are still getting worse, so people should increase vigilance, practice good quarantine and go to the hospital to have their health monitored by doctors.\n2. Common smallpox\nWith common smallpox, the incubation period is about 10 - 14 days (average 7 - 19 days). The disease is characterized by symptoms of sudden high fever, severe headache, diarrhea, back pain, fatigue, etc. After damage to the mucous membrane (enanthem), about 24 hours, the body develops a rash on the face, then to  hands and feet. The rashes progress to fluid-filled pimples from days 4 to 5 and pus-filled pimples on day 7. During the pustular stage, fever can recur day and night, accompanied by symptoms of headache and delirium. , fast pulse, low blood pressure,...\n3. Malignant smallpox\nAbout 5 to 10% of people infected with smallpox develop malignant variants. Patients develop symptoms of high fever, headache, fatigue, abdominal pain, and vomiting. The rash appears and spreads to the mucous membranes of the pharynx and throat, causing serious ulcers. The patient cannot eat or drink, so his health deteriorates further. On the face, legs, and arms, the rashes develop into blisters, then into pustules, round, tight, deeply damaging the skin and mucous membranes. Therefore, when the pustules crust and peel off, they will leave deep scars. With malignant smallpox, delayed medical intervention will cause the patient to die quickly.\n4. Hemorrhagic smallpox\nHemorrhagic smallpox is a condition in which lesions on the skin and mucous membranes bleed, causing death within 5-6 days of illness. Hemorrhagic smallpox has serious symptoms such as: heart failure, bleeding, bone marrow suppression,...; Patients even have a high risk of dying in just 3-4 days. At the same time, during the course of the disease, the patient may be infected with other types of bacteria on top of weak health and a weakened immune system. This causes hemorrhagic smallpox to progress quickly, causing a higher risk of death.",
