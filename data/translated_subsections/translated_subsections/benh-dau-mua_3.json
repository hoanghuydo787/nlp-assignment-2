    "subsection_content": "Smallpox is caused by the variola virus. Variola virus belongs to the Orthopoxvirus species, has a rectangular shape with dimensions of about 280 – 320 nm  x 200 – 250 nm. Smallpox virus has the ability to survive in the outside environment for many months, especially in cold, dry weather conditions. Viruses are often transmitted directly from person to person through droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. In a few cases, the variola virus spread further through the ventilation system in a building, causing people living there to become infected. The variola virus even sticks to clothes and makes those in contact infected. (4)\nMedical staff use electron microscopes to look for viruses or culture viruses from specimens taken from skin lesions.",
