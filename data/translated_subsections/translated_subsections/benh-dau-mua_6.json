Clinical diagnosis\nA case of smallpox often has clinical symptoms such as: high fever of 40 degrees Celsius, headache, fatigue, exhaustion, back pain, etc. In many cases, patients have abdominal pain and vomiting. When detecting the above symptoms, patients should quickly go to the hospital for early detection and diagnosis. During the medical examination, the doctor will ask you more information about your travel history, medical history, epidemiological factors, etc. From there, he will prescribe confirmatory testing and symptomatic treatment, medical care, and timely isolation. time to avoid the spread of disease.\n2. Testing\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of variola DNA in clinical specimens (in water or pustules) to diagnose smallpox. In addition, medical staff will use an electron microscope to find the virus or culture the virus from a sample taken from the skin lesion, then continue with a confirmatory PCR test. Note, testing for smallpox has a high risk of giving false positive results, so it is only performed for suspected cases of smallpox such as: Contact with infected people, fever, etc.\n3. Differential diagnosis\nSmallpox is often confused with chickenpox (varicella) and monkeypox. However, each disease has different symptoms. Chickenpox is more common, causing damage at different stages of development (incubation, onset, full-blown, recovery). While in smallpox, after incubation, the lesions have the same morphology (the rash progresses to pustules and crusts, dries, falls off and leaves scars). With monkeypox, patients have lymphadenopathy in the neck and groin, and the incidence and death rate is less.",
