    "subsection_content": "Currently, there is no specific medicine to treat smallpox, so doctors will treat symptoms, balance water and electrolytes, monitor infectious complications, and use antibiotics to prevent superinfection. The principle of treatment is not to let the acne break. During the onset and rash period, the patient is given a mild antiseptic for the eye, nose, and throat areas.\nPatients should eat nutritious food and drink plenty of water to quickly repel smallpox.\nIn addition, patients were given the smallpox antiviral drug tecovirimat, approved by the FDA in 2018, for a period of 14 days. Besides its antiviral effect, the drug can cause side effects such as headache, nausea, and stomach pain. The recommended dosage of the drug is as follows:\nPeople weighing 40kg or more take 2 times a day, 600mg each time; Pediatric patients weighing from 25 to 40kg, take 2 times a day, 400mg each time; Children weighing from 13 to 25 kg, take 2 times a day, 200mg each time; Children weighing less than 13kg: not recommended\nIn addition, patients are also given Brincidofovir - a drug that treats smallpox infection and complications. The medicine can cause side effects such as headache, nausea, and stomach pain. The recommended dosage is as follows:\nPeople weighing 48kg or more: use 200mg once a week; People weighing from 10kg to less than 48kg: use 4 mg/kg, take two doses per week; People weighing less than 10kg: use 6 mg/kg, once a week\nDuring treatment, the patient should be isolated in a private, well-ventilated room with sunlight, minimizing contact with many people until the blisters dry and scab completely. At the same time, sick people should wear loose, thin clothes, bathe in warm water, and not share personal items (towels, cups, cups, spoons, chopsticks) to avoid spreading the disease.\nWhen suffering from smallpox, patients often do not want to eat or drink. However, good nutrition will help you repel the disease more quickly. Therefore, you should eat soft foods, regularly drink orange juice, eat fruit, drink lots of water, etc. to provide enough nutrients, vitamins, and increase resistance.",
