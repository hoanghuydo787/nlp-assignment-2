    "subsection_content": "Epilepsy is a chronic disease that occurs due to abnormalities in the brain that lead to simultaneous stimulation of a group of neurons in the cerebral cortex, causing sudden and uncontrollable electrical discharges. Cortical stimulation in different areas can cause different manifestations. Convulsions are not the only manifestations, sudden absences of consciousness, and stiff limbs are also manifestations of epilepsy. (first)\nAccording to Associate Professor, Dr. Nguyen Van Lieu, epilepsy is currently a common disease with many diverse causes, including:\nGenetic factors: According to scientists, some types of epilepsy are linked to specific genes. However, these genes are just factors that make patients more sensitive to environmental influences that can cause epileptic seizures. In other words, genes are only factors that can influence, not decisive factors that definitely cause disease.; Traumatic brain injury: Serious accidents that cause trauma to any area are one of the causes of epilepsy.; Diseases that cause brain damage: In some cases, tumors in the brain or strokes occur, the risk of epilepsy is very high. Brain damage will cause central nervous system disorders, causing many changes in brain activity and increasing the risk of epilepsy.; Some diseases such as meningitis, encephalitis, abnormal structures in the brain of unknown cause... are also thought to be the cause of the disease.; Prenatal trauma: Newborns have immature immune systems and are very sensitive to brain damage. In case the mother has an infection or lack of nutrition, the baby is born at risk of brain damage... which will lead to epilepsy in the newborn.; For young children, even high fever and prolonged seizures can easily progress to epilepsy; In addition, the habit of using antidepressants, stimulants such as alcohol, tobacco and drugs is also one of the causes that can lead to epilepsy.",
