    "subsection_content": "Signs of epilepsy are very diverse. Epilepsy is divided into two main types: partial epilepsy and generalized epilepsy. In some cases, initially there is partial epilepsy, but if not detected and treated promptly, it will develop into generalized epilepsy. In each form of the disease, each person with epilepsy has different specific manifestations when having a seizure. (2)\n1. Partial epilepsy\nPartial seizures occur when part of the brain has abnormal activity. Therefore, symptoms of the disease only occur in a few parts of the body. Focal epilepsy can be divided into two types: simple partial epilepsy and complex partial epilepsy.\nSimple partial epilepsy: Patients may have spasticity or convulsions in one part of the body, abnormal vision and smell, anxiety and fear of something without clear cause, feeling dizziness and stomach discomfort...; Complex partial epilepsy: When a seizure occurs, most patients almost lose consciousness and do not know that a seizure is occurring. They stared, their faces blank, as if they were confused. The patient performs meaningless actions such as rubbing his hands, turning his head and walking back and forth... When he wakes up after a seizure, he doesn't remember what happened.\n2. Generalized epilepsy\nGeneralized seizures occur when there is too much electrical discharge in the brain, affecting the entire brain. The two most common types of generalized seizures are absence seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures.\nGeneralized tonic and convulsive seizures: This is a common form of epilepsy in adults and has quite clear manifestations, considered the easiest to recognize. The patient may lose consciousness, gradually lose balance and fall, possibly accompanied by cries and screams, but not because of pain. At this time, patients also have real convulsions, they cannot control their limbs due to the shaking of the muscles. Seizures can occur within a few minutes or longer. Patients may experience urinary incontinence and foaming at the mouth.; Absence seizures: This type of epilepsy often occurs in children and is rare in adults. The most characteristic manifestation of this type of epilepsy is loss of consciousness for about 5 - 15 seconds, staring, sometimes rolling the eyes upward, the child suddenly dropping the item while holding it... Because of these symptoms, many children suffer from epilepsy. Epilepsy often makes it impossible to concentrate and leads to serious decline in academic performance.; West syndrome: A form of generalized epilepsy that often occurs in infants from 3 to 8 months old, then stops and switches to another form of epilepsy when the child turns 4 years old. The disease is also known as neonatal spasms. Common causes are genetic problems, metabolic disorders, birth asphyxia, and brain infections leading to abnormalities in brain structure and function.\nThis special form of epilepsy causes children to have delayed physical and intellectual development, affecting their future learning process and can lead to autism. Some symptoms of the disease include the child's head nodding vigorously for a few seconds, the child's entire body bending forward, and the child's arms and legs bending forward. Each seizure may last only 2 seconds and then stop, then continue into a series of continuous spasms.",
