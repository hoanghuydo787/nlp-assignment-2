Clinical examination\nExplore the patient's medical history and clinical symptoms; Check the patient's behavior and motor skills to determine the type of epilepsy that person may have; Blood tests: From blood test results, doctors can also help patients know signs of infection, genetics and some other disorders that may be related to epilepsy.\n2. Perform various tests to clearly see damage in the brain\nAfter a clinical examination, the doctor will have the patient perform the following additional procedures to make the results as accurate as possible:\nElectroencephalogram: This is considered the most common method used in the process of diagnosing epilepsy. The specialist will use electrodes to record the brain's electrical activity. If the patient has epilepsy, the brain wave pattern will change abnormally even when they have not had a seizure.; Computed tomography (CT) scan: With this method, the doctor will see cross-sectional images of the brain and brain lesions such as tumors or brain bleeding.; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Is a way to use radio waves and magnets to help experts look in detail at the brain and detect damage or abnormalities in the brain - the cause of seizures.",
