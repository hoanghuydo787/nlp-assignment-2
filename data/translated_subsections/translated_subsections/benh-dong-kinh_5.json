Below are misconceptions about epilepsy that need to be eliminated immediately.\n1. Epilepsy is caused by demons\n“Epilepsy makes me always live in fear. I'm afraid my friends will laugh at me for being haunted. I also want to have fun with my friends and want every day to go to school to be a happy day; But I'm worried that when I have an attack, I won't be able to hide my illness anymore and if that happens, no one will want to play with me. My mother also said she was worried that no one would dare to marry me in the future, so she strictly forbade me to talk about my illness with strangers,\" 17-year-old N.H.H (Hung Yen City) shared.\nN.H.H's case is just one of many epilepsy patients facing stigma from the community. Many people believe that epilepsy is caused by some divine or demonic force. But that is a wrong view and needs to be dismissed immediately.\nN.H.H was directly treated by Assoc.Prof.Dr.BSCKII Nguyen Van Lieu - Leading expert in Neurology, Professional Advisor, Doctor of Medical Examination Department, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi.

This is a misconception and needs to be eliminated, even in the world there have been movements to protect the right of women with epilepsy to have children.\nIt is the excessive discrimination and erroneous views of the community that cause these women to suffer too much psychological pressure and pain rather than being deprived of their sacred rights to motherhood. In fact, if the patient has received abortive treatment, the patient can still have a normal pregnancy. The doctor will choose appropriate medications to reduce the risk of fetal defects.\n3. People with epilepsy always have seizures\nDifferent types of epilepsy will have different manifestations. Therefore, it can be affirmed that the symptoms of epilepsy are very diverse. In addition to convulsions, foaming at the mouth or rolling eyes, people with epilepsy may experience many other signs such as a feeling of fear, a dull face, etc.\n4.

Epilepsy is a mental illness\nMost people with epilepsy are unfairly labeled as mentally ill. The truth is, epilepsy is not a mental illness. Except during seizures, people with epilepsy are still alert and can function normally.\n6.
