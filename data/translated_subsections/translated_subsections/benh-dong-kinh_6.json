    "subsection_content": "Many studies have documented the difficulties and disadvantages that people with epilepsy are facing, largely due to misconceptions and incorrect attitudes of the whole community about this disease. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has launched a global campaign with the goal of fighting epilepsy and improving the quality of life for people with the disease.\nAssociate Professor, PhD. BSCKII Nguyen Van Lieu - a leading expert in Neurology also affirmed: \"Epilepsy is a disease that needs to be treated and can be completely cured. The cure rate is quite high, up to 70%. That means about 70% of patients can stop their seizures and return to normal life after a course of treatment of 2.5 - 3 years. Although the remaining 30% cannot be completely cured, they can still take medicine to maintain and ensure a healthy life.\"\nThere have been many successfully treated cases, they have stopped their seizures and returned to normal life. The case of Mr. N.H.D, 32 years old (Ngoc Lac District - Thanh Hoa) is an example.\nDiscovering that he had epilepsy was a big shock for Mr. N.H.D. Everything seemed to fall apart. From an energetic, energetic worker, he became withdrawn, living in guilt and fear. D. suffers because he can no longer work, because he can no longer earn money and cannot be the breadwinner of the family. Instead of taking care of his wife and children, he now becomes a burden to the whole family.\n\"Since the day I got sick, everything inside and out has been handled by my wife alone. I know my wife is under a lot of pressure. Many relatives don't understand and keep saying I'm being lazy, possessed by ghosts, and eating at my wife's expense.\" , yet my wife remained silent, standing by my side to help me maintain my spirit to treat the disease... Men who don't work to support their wives and children cannot live as well as die, it's very painful,\" Mr. D. confided.\nThen all his efforts paid off, Mr. D. was fortunate to know and be directly examined and treated by Dr. Lieu. N.H.D has finally recovered from his illness, found a new job, has more income to take care of his wife and children and is gradually stabilizing his life.\nMr. D. emotionally shared: \"For more than 4 years, I no longer know what seizures are. Thanks to Dr. Lieu, everything good has come to me. Not only do I live a normal life, but I also have a job with good income and can take care of everything at home with my wife. When my children see that their father is healthy, they are very happy, they study hard and do well. Absolutely\".",
