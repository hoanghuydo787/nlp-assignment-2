    "subsection_content": "Keratoconus is a condition in which the cornea protrudes, forming a pyramidal or cone-shaped cornea. This disease is explained by scientists as being caused by small protein fibers in the eye (collagen) that are responsible for holding the cornea in place. However, when these protein fibers weaken, they are no longer able to keep the cornea in shape and increasingly deform into a cone shape. (first)\nAnother reason mentioned is that the body no longer has enough antioxidants to protect the cornea. The cells then produce harmful substances, the same way a car releases exhaust fumes. Normally, antioxidants remove harmful substances and protect collagen fibers. However, when the level of oxidants decreases, low levels will cause collagen to weaken and the cornea to swell.\nI'm N.V.H.

She went to many doctors, had her glasses measured, had her glasses cut, and was diagnosed with amblyopia, but her condition tended to get worse.\nAfter examining and measuring the patient's glasses, M.D. Pham Huy Vu Tung, Ophthalmology Department, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, discovered that H. had symptoms of keratoconus.\nSo what is keratoconus?
