Ophthalmologists believe that genetics, environment, hormonal changes (after puberty)... are factors that more or less influence the cause of the disease.\nAccordingly, if a family member has had keratoconus, there is a high risk that the next generation may also have the disease. The disease can also occur more often in people with allergic diseases such as asthma, eczema...\nOther causes include:\nAge: The disease often begins in adolescence but can appear earlier in childhood or not until age 30. The disease can also occur in people 40 years of age and older, but is less common. ; Certain disorders: Studies have found a link between keratoconus and systemic diseases such as Down syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, osteogenesis defects, and retinitis pigmentosa .; Inflammation: Inflammation from allergies, asthma or allergic eye disease can break down corneal tissue.; Rubbing your eyes: Rubbing your eyes too much over time can damage the cornea, creating an opportunity for keratoconus to become more severe.; Race: A study of 16,000 people with keratoconus found that black or Latino people were about 50% more likely to have the disease than white people.",
