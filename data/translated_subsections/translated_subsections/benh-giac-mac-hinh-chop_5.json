    "subsection_content": "In mild cases, the doctor may recommend that the patient replace new glasses to overcome blurred vision, or wear hard contact lenses with good gas permeability. However, over time, the person may need other treatments to strengthen the cornea and improve vision. (3)\nUsing hard contact lenses with good gas permeability helps improve blurred vision in people with keratoconus\nAnother treatment called corneal collagen cross-linking may stop the disease from progressing. Or apply the intracorneal ring segmentation (INTACS) method under the corneal surface to flatten the cone and improve vision.\nWhen all treatments fail to improve vision, the last resort will be a corneal transplant. This is a safe surgery and has a high success rate. The doctor will do this by replacing the center of the cornea with a cornea from a donor and sewing the new cornea into place. You may need to use contact lenses afterward.\nDr. Tung recommends that although eye disease progresses slowly, the serious consequence is permanent vision loss. Therefore, when detecting unusual signs of the eye, it is necessary to go to a reputable eye specialist to be examined, detected and treated promptly.",
