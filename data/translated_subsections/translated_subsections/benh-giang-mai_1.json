Recognizing the stage not only helps the patient have more chances of being cured but also avoids the risk of spreading it to relatives and partners.\nAccording to Dr. Doan Ngoc Thien, Department of Andrology, Tam Anh General Hospital System, syphilis if not diagnosed and treated can persist for many years and is currently divided into 2 stages: early syphilis and late syphilis. (2)\n1. Early syphilis\nStage I syphilis: The patient still lives normally and does not have any symptoms. However, the disease is most contagious during this and subsequent stages. Usually, the main stage of syphilis begins about 3-4 weeks (about 9 - 90 days) after bacterial infection. The patient develops a small, round ulcer called a chancre. Chancre is not painful but is highly infectious. These sores can appear anywhere bacteria entered the body such as the mouth, genitals or anus (or can be in non-genital locations). The wound will heal on its own in about 3-10 weeks whether treated or not. The patient may not notice the appearance of a chancre or find that the chancre disappears on its own. If not diagnosed and treated during this period, after 4-8 weeks from the appearance of the initial lesion, the disease will progress to stage II syphilis; Stage II syphilis: High risk of infection to others. Syphilis during this period is often easily confused with another disease such as drug allergy or psoriasis. With signs such as skin rash and sore throat. These rashes do not itch and usually appear on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, but can also occur anywhere on the body. Some people don't even notice the rash before it disappears. Other symptoms of stage 2 syphilis may also include: headache, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, fever, weight loss, hair loss, joint pain... There may be neurological signs: one-sided deafness , ophthalmic nerve paralysis, uveitis, meningitis. Symptoms of stage II syphilis can go away on their own even without any treatment. However, if the patient is not treated, the disease will progress to latent syphilis.; Latent syphilis: no clinical signs or symptoms. Therefore, it can only be detected by serum testing. Divided into 2 types: Divided into two stages: early latent (less than two years) and late latent (more than two years). Without treatment, all patients will be asymptomatic 12 – 24 months after initial infection.\n2. Late syphilis\nStage III syphilis: Appears often months or years after chancre appears in one-third of cases if not treated. Complications include: deep lesions, gums in the skin, bones, internal organs, cardiovascular and nervous system. At this stage, the patient is less likely to infect their partner because the spirochetes have penetrated and localized in the internal organs, no longer in the skin or mucous membranes.",
