    "subsection_content": "Doctors from the Department of Andrology, Tam Anh General Hospital System said that the cause of syphilis is a bacteria called Treponema pallidum. This type of bacteria was discovered in 1905, shaped like a spring with 6-14 spirals. Treponema pallidum's resistance is very weak, it cannot live more than a few hours outside the human body. The appropriate temperature for spirochetes to grow is 37*C. Soap and antiseptics can kill spirochetes in a few minutes.\nThe disease is spread when a healthy person comes into direct contact with an infected person's syphilis chancre through vaginal, anal or oral sex. The disease can also be transmitted indirectly through contaminated objects or objects or through scratches on the skin or mucous membranes. In addition, the disease can be transmitted through blood or from mother to child during pregnancy.\nOnce cured, syphilis will not recur. However, you can get reinfected if you come into contact with another person's syphilis sores.",
