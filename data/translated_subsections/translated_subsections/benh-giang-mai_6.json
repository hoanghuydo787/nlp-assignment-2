    "subsection_content": "Besides observing the skin manifestations of people with syphilis, doctors also diagnose the disease through the following test results:\n1. Blood test\nA blood test will help confirm the presence of antibodies that the body produces to fight infection. Antibodies against the bacteria that cause syphilis remain in the patient's body for many years. Therefore, the test can be used to determine current or past infections.\n2. Cerebrospinal fluid\nIf a person suspects neurological complications related to syphilis, the doctor may also recommend taking a sample of cerebrospinal fluid through a procedure called a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to confirm the diagnosis.",
