However, because there is still no vaccine for the disease, prevention is better than cure. You can prevent your risk of getting sick by following these tips:\nDo not have promiscuous sex. Be monogamous.; Use condoms to reduce the risk of infection, paying special attention to covering damaged areas.; Avoid using stimulants and alcohol to maintain good judgment and avoid unsafe sexual practices.; Do not share personal items with others to avoid bacteria remaining on surfaces and spreading through open wounds.; If syphilis is discovered before giving birth, the mother needs to notify the doctor for instructions on how to care for herself and prevent infection to the baby.; Follow the regular health check-up schedule every 6 months or as advised by your doctor; Enhance resistance by building a balanced menu, exercising regularly, avoiding stress.; Even though syphilis has been treated, the patient is still at risk of reinfection, so he or she should comply with the treatment course and take preventive measures recommended by a specialist.",
