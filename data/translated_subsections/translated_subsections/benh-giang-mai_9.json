Don't wait until clear symptoms appear to see a doctor, because the condition may be serious and difficult to cure completely.\nFor women, before planning pregnancy, it is also necessary to check for bacterial infection. If so, take time to complete treatment before getting pregnant. If the disease is detected during pregnancy, the patient should discuss with an obstetrician for treatment and limit the risk of infection to the baby.\nAlthough syphilis can be cured, patients should not be subjective and not treat it according to the doctor's regimen. Late detection, non-compliance with the regimen, and interruptions can all make bacteria resistant to the drug and make treatment ineffective.",
