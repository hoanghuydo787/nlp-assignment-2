    "subsection_content": "First stage (lasting from weeks 2 - 3): Gnathostome larvae attack the body, they will pass through the stomach, intestines, and liver, so the patient does not have clear symptoms. In some cases, patients show signs of fever, excessive fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea.; Migration phase (lasting from weeks 3 - 4): Symptoms of this stage are related to the location of the parasite moving under the skin, usually starting within 3 - 4 weeks after infection. Patients may experience swelling under the skin that may be accompanied by pain, redness or itching. If you press on the bump with your finger, it won't leave an indentation.\nParasites Gnathostoma spp. can penetrate organs such as eyes, ears, lungs, bladder, brain... If they move into the eyes, it can easily lead to impaired vision and blindness; nerves and spine causing nerve pain and muscle paralysis; into the brain causing headaches, decreased consciousness, coma, and death. Note, patients with parasites moving under the skin in the facial area will be at greater risk of attacks on the brain and eyes.",
