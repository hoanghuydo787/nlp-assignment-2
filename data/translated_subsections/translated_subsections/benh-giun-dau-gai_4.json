    "subsection_content": "Adult gnathostome worms are 11-54 mm long, females (25 - 54mm) are longer than males (11 - 25 mm). Female worms have a round back, a slightly flat abdomen and 2 large fleshy spines around the head. Male worms have smaller and blunter spines, and 8 papillae on the tail surrounding the anus.; The body of an adult gnathostome worm is cylindrical, with a bulbous head, covered with rows of sharp spines. The worm's head is divided into 4 sacs, 4 hollow chambers, each chamber continuous with a sac in the neck through the central chamber.; Adult worms live in the stomach wall of certain animals (pigs, dogs, cats and wild animals - this group of animals is called the host). Gnathostome worms do not have a digestive system, so they use their bodies to absorb nutrients from the host.; Male and female worms mate and lay eggs. Worm eggs are excreted in the stool. Gnathostome eggs are thin, oval shaped, 40-70 micrometers in size. Inside the egg contains 1-2 embryo cells; When released into the outside environment, if gnathostome eggs encounter a water environment, after only 1 week, the eggs develop into embryos, releasing stage 1 larvae. Larvae of Gnathostoma spp are 3-5mm long. , with a diameter of about 0.3mm. When eaten by small molluscs (such as shrimp, prawns, crabs... called first intermediate hosts), they develop into stage 2 larvae; When freshwater fish, eels, frogs, frogs, and snails (the second intermediate host) eat the molluscs, the 2nd stage larvae develop into 3rd stage larvae. If pigs, cats, dogs or Wild animals eat frogs, frogs, freshwater fish, snails, snakes... then after 4 weeks, the larvae develop into adult gnathostomes.; Worms lay eggs in the stomach, the eggs will fall into the stomach and be passed out in the stool. A new life cycle of gnathostome worms appears again.\nIn humans, if you eat food (freshwater fish, snails, frogs, frogs, snakes, eels, shrimp, crabs...) that are uncooked, raw, salad... or drink water containing gnathostome larvae, you will infection. A few people are infected with gnathostomiasis because the larvae burrow through the skin. Gnathostome larvae can survive in the human body for 10 - 12 years.",
