Following the bloodstream and lymphatic system, the larvae pass through the intestinal wall and move to the heart and lungs. After 10-14 days of development in the lungs, the larvae continue to sneak up the airways and attack the throat. At this time, the patient feels uncomfortable so he coughs continuously and swallows the eggs back into his intestines.; Adult stage: the larvae return to the intestine and develop into male or female roundworms. Female worms can be longer than 40cm, male worms are smaller; Reproductive stage: every day, female worms can lay 200,000 eggs. Fertilized eggs from male and female worms will be released into the outside environment in the feces. The entire process from the moment a human swallows an egg until it reaches adulthood can last from 2-3 months. Roundworms can live in the human body for 1-2 years.",
