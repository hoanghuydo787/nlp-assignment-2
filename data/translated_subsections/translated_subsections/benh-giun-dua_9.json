Therefore, diagnosing roundworms by examination is usually not decisive for diagnosis; Diagnostic testing: Testing can detect patients infected with roundworms, making diagnosis and treatment easier. Patients are tested for roundworm eggs in stool using the technique of smearing stool on glass slides and observing under a microscope. Concentration techniques can be used to have a higher density of roundworm eggs, helping to minimize cases of worm spawning. less eggs. Because female worms have a period of not giving birth, in some cases it is necessary to test again after 2-3 days and test continuously for 3 days to reach an accurate conclusion. In some rare cases, patients are infected with male worms so no eggs are seen in the stool.\nDuring the larval stage, if the patient is newly infected with roundworms for the first time or has previously been cleared of worms, stool tests will not find worm eggs. Instead, the patient can have an abdominal X-ray with contrast dye given. The worms absorb the contrast material, which will produce images of the worms on film.\nCurrently, with the development of testing techniques, it is possible to determine roundworm infection using immunological techniques with IgM and IgG antibodies.",
