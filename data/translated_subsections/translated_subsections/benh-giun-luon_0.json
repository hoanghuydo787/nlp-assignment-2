    "subsection_content": "Strongyloides stercoralis was first discovered in the South, Vietnam in 1876. The true frequency of the disease is difficult to determine because the majority are often latent infections (2- 20%). Presentation can vary from asymptomatic to multiple organ failure. The mortality rate of patients infected with strongyloides admitted to 3 hospitals is 16.7%. In immunocompromised people, it can cause disseminated strongyloidiasis and death.\nThe disease has two forms: parasitic strongyloides and free-living strongyloides in the environment outside the host's body. The larvae penetrate through the skin into the lymphatic and venous systems and into the circulation to the lungs, trachea, esophagus, stomach and the first part of the small intestine located there. When larvae reach the lungs, they may not enter the alveoli but circulate in the blood and reach other organs. During migration, the larvae must undergo two molts to mature.\nAdult worms usually live in the duodenum and jejunum. Severe cases of infection can occur in the stomach, pylorus, colon, biliary tract... Each adult worm can live up to 5 years and continue the reproductive cycle. Worm eggs appear 28 days after infection. Strongyloides are the only parasite where larvae are found in feces (not eggs). Strongyloides eggs are only found when there is massive diarrhea in cases of severe illness, the eggs do not have time to hatch and the larvae in the intestines are passed out in the stool. Under favorable climatic conditions, the larvae can develop into strongyloides that freely live in the outdoors.\nIn some cases, such as long-term constipation, reduced intestinal motility, diverticulosis, larvae that are not excreted in the stool can pass through the intestinal wall into the circulatory system and continue the parasitic cycle as above. The central nervous system, liver, and lungs are common sites of this autoinfectious cycle. This auto-infection cycle, especially in immunocompromised people, is the cause of prolonged reinfection even after leaving the endemic area, which can last up to 36 years.(2)",
