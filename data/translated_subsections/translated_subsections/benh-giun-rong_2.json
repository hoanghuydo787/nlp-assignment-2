    "subsection_content": "Each female dragon worm can carry 3 million larvae inside her. In the outside environment, larvae can live up to 3 weeks. Dragon worm larvae become food for Cyclops crustaceans (arthropods, water fleas), but when eaten by crustaceans, they can still live and survive for up to 4 months. Therefore, the spread of disease-causing larvae in humans and animals becomes easier and faster.\nDragon worms enter the bodies of humans and animals mainly through contaminated water sources, or the digestive tract when eating food contaminated with the bodies of small crustaceans (Cyclops) infected with worm larvae. Specifically, when aquatic species eat water fleas, they will be infected with larvae. From there, the larvae continue to parasitize the bodies of fish, shrimp, crabs, frogs...\nPeople and animals (dogs, cats, etc.) who eat raw or undercooked seafood are at risk of being infected with dragon worm larvae. In addition, patients can be infected with larvae by drinking water containing dead water fleas infected with worm larvae. Water sources that can contain dragon worm larvae are water in rivers, streams, ponds, lakes... The disease can occur in all ages with a morbidity rate of up to 60%.\nAfter a person swallows a water flea, gastric acid in the stomach causes the flea to die, and the body gradually dissolves, releasing dragon worm larvae. Larvae attached to the stomach take about 10 weeks to develop into worms. Worms penetrate through the wall of the stomach and small intestine into the abdominal cavity and retroperitoneal space. After mating, the male worm dies, the female worm matures and burrows into the host's skin to parasitize, causing clinical manifestations.\nThe time for the larvae to develop into worms and burrow into the host's skin lasts from 9 to 14 months, with almost no symptoms until the worm burrows into the skin. The head of the female dragon worm reaches the epidermis, causing blisters, which will burst when exposed to water, causing ulcers. After 2-3 weeks, when the ulcer comes into contact with water, the worms release their larvae into the environment. Some adult worms will crawl out, others can crawl back into the body, many will die in the host's body, decay and cause a severe inflammatory reaction.\nThe disease does not cause direct death but can cause indirect death from complications of the disease such as: secondary infection, cold abscess, joint infection, spinal cord paralysis, hemiplegia,...\nWater fleas swallow dragon worm larvae\nDragon worm disease is not seasonal but appears year-round. The length of time the number of cases increased varies from place to place. In dry places, dragon worms are often infected during the rainy season. On the contrary, places with a lot of rain are often infected with helminths in the dry season. The risk of disease does not discriminate between age and gender. However, according to statistics, the number of cases infected with this type of worm is mainly in the age group of 15 - 45 years old and working in agriculture. Therefore, people who often work in cattle raising, aquaculture, and farming are at high risk of getting sick, because they are often exposed to water sources containing dragon worm larvae.
