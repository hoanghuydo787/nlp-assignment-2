    "subsection_content": "After humans are infected with dragon worm larvae, they will be released in the stomach to develop into worms and penetrate the lining of the stomach, then continue to burrow into the connective tissue and move the subcutaneous tissues, usually the area. leg skin. The incubation process takes about 9 to 14 months, and the adult and parasitic female worms in humans can be up to 1 meter long. Before emerging from the skin, the female worm will create a painful and itchy blister. At this stage, if the blister breaks and comes into contact with water, it will create an opportunity for the female dragon worm to release the worm larvae into the environment.\nOnce infected with dragon worm larvae, the patient will have no symptoms for the first year. Symptoms usually only appear when the female worms begin to burrow into the skin and destroy tissue. When the worms begin to burrow into the skin, the patient will have symptoms such as:\nBlisters and swelling appear on the skin with a diameter of 2-7cm.; Numbness and severe itching; Feeling pain and burning in the damaged skin area; Hives, erythema.; Mild fever; Diarrhea.; Difficulty breathing, dizziness, vomiting; Severe dermatitis.\nDuring the process of laying eggs, worms can release toxins that cause serious ulcers and severe pain. When the swelling bursts and releases yellow fluid, the worm will poke its head out. If there is no impact, the worm will come out completely on its own after 3-6 weeks. Some female worms will crawl back deeper inside.\nAlong the path of the female dragon worm, it can cause secondary infections leading to sepsis. When secondary infection occurs, the patient will have symptoms related to inflammation and joint pain. If not treated promptly, the patient may face bone and joint sclerosis and ligament contractures.",
