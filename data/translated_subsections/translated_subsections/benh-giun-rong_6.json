    "subsection_content": "There is currently no vaccine or medicine to treat dragon worm disease, but can only be treated symptomatically. Therefore, early detection and treatment will reduce dangerous complications.\nClean the wound and soak it in water: when diagnosed with dragon worm disease, the patient needs to limit contact with water sources. Clean the wound thoroughly. You can soak the wound in a basin of warm water to help the worms release all the larvae, making it easier to remove the worms. The water soaked in the wound should be treated with chemicals or boiled to kill the worm larvae.; Treat the wound with antibiotics: the patient needs to rest in bed, clean the ulcer and treat with local antibiotics to avoid secondary infection.; Pulling the worms out by hand: this is the traditional method of pulling the worms out with a small wooden stick. After the worms have released all their larvae, they will tend to crawl out. Wrap the worm's head around a wooden stick and slowly pull it out centimeter by centimeter, a little every day. Combined with use with anti-worm medication and wound sterilization makes it easier to pull the worms out. You should go to a medical facility to have the doctor pull the worm out, because if the worm is accidentally broken, it can cause the patient to have a secondary infection, causing sepsis or an abscess.; Take anti-worm medication: Using the anti-worm medication metronidazole and thiabendazole reduces symptoms and promotes worm burrowing or helps pull the worm out faster by hand. This medicine can help fight inflammation but cannot kill larvae and adult dragon worms.; Surgery to remove the worms: when the worms are parasitic under the skin, surgery can be performed to remove the worms. Surgery is only possible when the worms are not blocking the deep fascia or wrapping around the tendons.",
