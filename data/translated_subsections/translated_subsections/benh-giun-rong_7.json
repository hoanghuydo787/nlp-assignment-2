However, dragon worm larvae can parasitize many hosts such as dogs, cats, seafood, etc., so preventing infection is still difficult. What is more worrying is that in recent years, Vietnam has recorded a number of cases of the disease.\nThe disease has no symptoms during the first year of incubation, so detection and treatment become difficult. So be proactive in preventing it with the following measures:\nEat cooked and drink boiled: worms and dragon worm larvae can die when exposed to hot temperatures above 100 degrees Celsius. Food should be completely cooked, especially seafood. You should clean the intestines of fish, frogs, shrimp, etc. before processing. Raw vegetables grown under water should be scalded with boiling water before eating or washed under clean, strong water.; Drinking water should be boiled or filtered by machine.; Only use clean water sources, if clean water sources cannot be used, people need to use water treatment measures such as: using water filtration equipment, insecticides in the water source to kill water fleas. . Do not feed dogs and cats fish, frogs, and seafood that have not been cooked; People with dragon worm disease need to cover the wound and not come into contact with clean water sources in the community to avoid female worms releasing eggs into the water environment, infecting everyone.; If your dog or cat shows symptoms such as: blisters, swelling, or worms appearing in the wound, they should avoid contact with clean community water sources.\nIn recent years, Vietnam has recorded a number of cases of dracunculus disease in humans and animals. Although the risk of death from the disease is low, complications from dragon worm disease can be dangerous to health, greatly affecting the patient's health.",
