    "subsection_content": "Acute gout is a form of arthritis, coming from an abnormal increase in uric acid in the blood, leading to excess. When uric acid levels are excessive, due to many external causes, they will accumulate in a joint and cause recurrent acute or chronic inflammation. The common location in gout cases is the big toe joint.\nPeople with acute gout will experience clinical symptoms such as acute pain, heat and redness around the inflamed joint, and in some cases there is also heat generation. The pain caused by acute gout and its effects will hinder the patient's activities and quality of life. Gout pain occurs often late at night, potentially causing the patient to wake up and make it difficult to fall back asleep. At the same time as arthritis, there is a decrease in range of activity, relatively limiting the patient's movement in daily activities. (first)\nThe disease can occur in all subjects and age groups, but according to statistics, men have a higher incidence of the disease than women and occurs more often in middle-aged people. Postmenopausal women are also more likely to have gout than other ages. These clinical symptoms will become increasingly serious if the patient does not promptly treat gout properly, which is also the reason for the disease to progress more severely.\nAcute gout occurs due to uric acid levels in the blood, so patients need to lower uric acid levels and control them during treatment to minimize symptoms. It should be noted that, currently there is no method that can completely cure gout, so people with gout or a history of gout need to be careful in their diet and daily living habits to maintain the amount of gout. Stable uric acid, improve overall health, minimize the risk of gout recurrence.",
