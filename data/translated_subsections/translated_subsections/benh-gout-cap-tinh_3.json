    "subsection_content": "1. Chronic kidney disease\nChronic kidney disease is one of the complications that people with acute gout need to pay attention to and prevent from the beginning. Because the formation of gout is related to the filtering ability of the kidneys, if uric acid is not completely filtered and remains inside the human body for a long time, it will increase the risk of kidney stones. Statistics show that the rate of people with gout developing kidney stones is 20%.\nKidney stones caused by urate salts can damage the kidneys, cause inflammation, and even leave scars. From there, complications of chronic kidney disease in gout patients will also increase.\n2. Increased blood pressure\nUric acid concentration is related to blood pressure, so when uric acid concentration increases, it will also affect blood pressure index. Specifically, high uric acid in the blood will cause blood pressure and flow to change, thereby causing high blood pressure for people with acute gout.\n3. Diabetes\nDiabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a big warning for patients with acute gout. Doctors have pointed out that diabetes is quite closely related, so gout can increase the risk of diabetes.\nTo prevent diabetes complications, patients need to treat acute gout as soon as it is detected. At the same time, optimize the treatment process by combining a healthy diet, limiting the use of foods that have the risk of regularly increasing blood sugar levels. This not only helps patients limit the risk of diabetes complications but also prevents future gout recurrence.\n4. Hyperlipidemia\nGout is caused by high levels of uric acid, causing urate crystals to deposit in the joints and causing gout inflammation. Abnormal increases in uric acid can cause blood lipid disorders, including hyperlipidemia.\n5. Cardiovascular disease\nAcute gout is not a direct cause of cardiovascular diseases, but statistics from cases show that people with gout are twice as likely to have heart attacks and strokes as people without gout.\nIn particular, if gout occurs in the elderly, with weak resistance or people with a history of cardiovascular disease, they are at risk of death from heart failure.\n6. Liver failure\nLiver failure can develop from gout, similar to kidney and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in uric acid levels in the blood will affect the function of several organs, including the liver. The effects that gout causes to other organs are all negative effects and should not be prolonged because it will make the disease more serious and complicated.",
