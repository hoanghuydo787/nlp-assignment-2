    "subsection_content": "Normally, the uric acid index in the blood is maintained at a fixed level for men: 210 - 420 umol/L and 150 - 350 umol/L for women. When the kidneys cannot eliminate uric acid, either because the body produces too much or because of abnormalities in the cycle of creating this acid, it leads to the risk of gout.(2)\nExcess urate crystals can accumulate in your joints for years without causing symptoms. These crystals have small, hard, sharp structures that can rub against the synovial membrane  causing a lot of swelling, pain and inflammation. When this happens, acute gout attacks occur.\nPurine is a natural substance that exists in foods. Each type of food has different levels of purine, especially some groups of meat, fish, seafood... that contain high levels of this substance. When digesting purine, our body will produce a substance called uric acid and if we consume a lot of foods containing purine, it means excess uric acid is produced.\nPrimary cause (idiopathic)\nThis is the cause of the majority of cases, gout is often associated with genetic or physical factors. People with idiopathic gout have endogenous purine synthesis that increases uric acid excessively. The disease mostly occurs in men over the age of 40, with unhealthy living and eating habits.\nSecondary cause\nIs a condition of increased uric acid in the blood due to some other diseases or some other causes such as some blood diseases such as polycythemia vera, medullary leukemia, hodgkin's disease, lymph node sarcoma, bone marrow pain, or the use of Use of drugs when treating malignant diseases.",
