    "subsection_content": "Gout is classified according to the stage of disease progression. Specifically:\nAsymptomatic Hyperuricemia (Asymptomatic Hyperuricemia)\nA person can have increased uric acid levels without any external symptoms. At this stage, the patient does not need treatment, although urate crystals can deposit in the tissue and cause minor damage. If blood test results show increased uric acid but there are no clinical manifestations of the disease, the patient should go to a musculoskeletal specialist for appropriate advice.\nAcute gout\nUrate crystal deposits have a small, hard, sharp structure when rubbed against the soft lining of the joint, called the synovium, causing a lot of pain, swelling and inflammation. When this happens, acute gout attacks form. These attacks can be \"triggered\" after the patient experiences stress, has just gone through an alcohol party, after a hearty meal or uses drugs, gets cold... can also cause the disease to flare up.\nChronic gout is temporarily stable between acute attacks\nThis is the middle stage of acute attacks, the recurrence interval of acute attacks is often unknown, it can be several months, or several years, depending on the treatment process as well as the patient's lifestyle balance. According to statistics, about 62% of cases relapse in the first year, 16% in 1-2 years, 11% in 2-5 years, and 7% do not relapse in 10 years or more. During this time, urate crystals continue to deposit and accumulate in body tissues.\nChronic gout has complications\nThis is the disease that causes the most trouble and weakness for patients. In the chronic stage, patients develop large tophi particles around the joints, even in muscle tissue, and in the kidneys, causing serious damage to the joints and kidneys. If left untreated for a long time, it will lead to chronic phase.\nPseudogout\nA condition that is easily confused with gout is pseudogout, also known as calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease. Symptoms of this disease are very similar to those of gout, although flare-ups are usually less severe.\nThe main difference between gout and pseudogout is that the joints are irritated by calcium pyrophosphate crystals rather than urate crystals. Patients also have different treatment requirements for gout.",
