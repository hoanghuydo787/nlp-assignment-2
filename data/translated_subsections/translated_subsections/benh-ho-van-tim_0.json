    "subsection_content": "Valvular regurgitation is a condition in which the heart valves do not close tightly, causing blood to flow back into the heart chambers every time the heart contracts. Therefore, the heart has to work harder to compensate for the lost blood volume due to reflux. The disease is divided into 4 types, corresponding to 4 heart valves:\nMitral valve regurgitation: blood refluxes from the left ventricle to the left atrium.; Tricuspid valve regurgitation: blood refluxes from the right ventricle to the right atrium.; Aortic regurgitation: blood refluxes from the aorta to the left ventricle.; Pulmonary valve regurgitation: blood refluxes from the pulmonary artery to the right ventricle.\nWith each type of heart valve regurgitation, there will be 4 levels of valve regurgitation: 1/4, 2/4, 3/4 and 4/4. Level 4/4 leak is the most severe, accompanied by many dangerous complications to the patient's health. (first)\nThe tricuspid valve and pulmonary valve often have mild physiological valve regurgitation.",
