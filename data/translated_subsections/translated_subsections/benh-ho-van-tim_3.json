    "subsection_content": "Heart valve regurgitation in particular and cardiovascular diseases in general all cause many health effects, even threatening the patient's life. Common complications of the disease are very diverse, the most common are complications related to the function of the heart, besides leaking heart valves can also impair the function of many other organs.\nHeart failure: This is a common complication in patients with abnormal heart valves because the heart has to work harder to compensate for the lack of blood. Over time, the heart chambers dilate and lead to heart failure.; Arrhythmia: This is a condition in which the heart beats abnormally, when it is too fast (frequency > 100 beats/minute) or too slow (frequency < 60 beats/minute), the heartbeat is irregular or sometimes fast and sometimes slow. Cardiac arrhythmia is the cause of 80% of sudden deaths; Infectious endocarditis: a common complication of aortic valve regurgitation, this condition occurs due to blood flowing backward from the aorta to the left ventricle, easily damaging the heart's endocardium. This area is where bacteria can easily stick, causing infection or abscess; Stroke: Patients with heart valve regurgitation experience complications of heart failure, dilated heart chambers, and arrhythmias that will create conditions for blood clots to form in the brain, causing a cerebrovascular accident (stroke).",
