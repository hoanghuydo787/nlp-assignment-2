Clinical symptoms show signs of pathology (dyspnea, chest tightness, fainting...), medical history suggests the cause (congenital, myocardial infarction, trauma,...), cardiac examination with stethoscope. In people with leaky heart valves, when listening to the heart, you often hear a murmur due to abnormal blood flow in the heart.\nThe patient has an abnormal murmur when examined with a stethoscope.\nTo add accuracy to clinical conclusions, doctors often prescribe additional paraclinical diagnostic methods as follows:\nElectrocardiogram: This diagnostic method can show non-specific manifestations such as left atrial thickening, left ventricular thickening, atrial fibrillation, etc.; Chest X-ray: Can see an enlarged heart silhouette, interstitial edema, and alveolar edema, often seen in acute valve regurgitation or severe heart failure.; Doppler echocardiography: Is the most important method in accurately diagnosing heart valve regurgitation, helping to determine and evaluate the degree of valve regurgitation and the disease's impact on heart functions. This method can also help detect other cardiovascular diseases of the fetus.; Cardiac catheterization and angiography: This diagnostic method is usually only applied when other paraclinical methods cannot conclude the degree of heart valve regurgitation, evaluate heart function, or when surgery is planned.\nIn addition, there are a number of other paraclinical tests such as: Magnetic resonance imaging, CT scanner, hematology and blood chemistry tests... Depending on the condition of each patient, doctors will have specific instructions. to strengthen the accuracy of disease diagnoses.",
