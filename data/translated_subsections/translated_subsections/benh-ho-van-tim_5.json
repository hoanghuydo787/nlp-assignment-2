Normally, at the level of 1/4 valve regurgitation and very mild symptoms, treatment intervention is not necessary.\nThe degree of 2/4 valve regurgitation is still considered mild, but if there are symptoms, doctors will prescribe the use of some medications such as diuretics (furosemide, spironolactone), afterload-reducing drugs, and antihistamines.

In case the valve leaks 3/4 or more, the patient must be treated actively and closely monitored.\nIn cases of severe heart valve regurgitation (3.5/4 or more), the doctor will decide whether to choose open heart surgery or percutaneous cardiac intervention based on the level of valve damage. In particular, open heart surgery is often applied in cases where the heart valve needs to be replaced, percutaneous intervention methods can be applied in some cases (mitral valve repair through a catheter - Mitra clip).

Patients are also recommended to check their blood pressure regularly and treat hypertension (if any) because high blood pressure will cause the heart to work harder.\nIn addition, people with heart valve disease need to pay attention to a bland, low-salt, low-fat diet and regularly check blood fat levels to prevent coronary artery disease; should not drink coffee. The use of alcoholic beverages should be limited because it can increase the severity of arrhythmia (if any). People with valve regurgitation also need to pay attention to weight control, avoid weight gain and obesity to reduce pressure on the heart.",
