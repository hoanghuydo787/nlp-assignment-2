    "subsection_content": "The prognosis of the disease depends on many factors such as the degree of valve regurgitation, the type of valve regurgitation, the time of disease detection, the underlying condition as well as treatment methods. In most cases, early detection and timely treatment will give good results, helping to prolong the patient's life.\nPatients with mitral valve regurgitation or aortic valve regurgitation often experience many serious complications and have a worse prognosis than the other two types of valve regurgitation. Heart valve regurgitation in the elderly with underlying diseases such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, heart failure... has a lower life expectancy than people with simple valve regurgitation. The results of some surveys show that mitral valve regurgitation accompanied by coronary artery disease after 5 years of follow-up has a mortality rate of up to 62%.\nWhen the patient is diagnosed early, the heart valve is not too leaky, there are few complications, treatment effectiveness and the chance of prolonging life will be higher than when detected in the severe leak stage. When the valve leaflets are seriously damaged, the risk of sudden death can appear at any time. Therefore, when a patient has been diagnosed with pathologically leaking heart valves (moderate to severe valve regurgitation), the patient needs to pay attention to monitoring and comply with the doctor's treatment instructions.\nTo date, heart valve replacement/repair is the only method to completely resolve heart valve damage. However, this method still has certain disadvantages and risks, but statistics show that heart valve replacement/repair significantly improves the patient's life expectancy.\nPatients can prolong their life if they strictly follow the doctor's treatment regimen",
