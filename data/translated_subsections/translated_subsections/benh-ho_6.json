    "subsection_content": "According to Dr. Thuy Hang, most cases of acute cough should be treated empirically and focus on reducing symptoms with medication.(4)\n1. Anti-allergic medicine\nCan be used to relieve symptoms of nasal congestion due to allergies leading to mouth breathing causing dry throat and coughing. Doctor Thuy Hang recommends that you should not use anti-allergy drugs for a long time because it can cause drug resistance or bad side effects for the nose and throat.\n2. Expectorant\nCan be used when there is too much phlegm causing airway obstruction.\n3. Cough suppressants\nCan be used to relieve coughs by reducing the cough reflex. Commonly used suppressants to treat coughs include dextromethorphan and guaifenesin.\nDoctor Thuy Hang recommends that coughing is a basic protective mechanism and plays an important part in the body's immune system. Reducing the cough reflex can have a detrimental effect on recovery time. Treatment of chronic cough should aim to target the underlying cause whenever possible to relieve the cough rather than suppress it.\n4. Antibiotics\nIf cough is due to infection, treatment with antibiotics appropriate to the pathogen is required. For causes of chronic upper respiratory tract inflammation, treat continuously for at least 1 week with an appropriate antibiotic.\n5. Inhaled albuterol and ipratropium aerosol solutions\nCan be used as a bronchodilator in constricted airways to relieve symptoms in emergency situations.\n6. Inhaled steroids or anticholinergics\nThese two drugs can be prescribed to treat coughs in allergic respiratory diseases.\n7. Treatment of cardiovascular disease\nIf the cough is due to cardiac function, the patient should be treated according to appropriate cardiovascular recommendations based on each individual's specific symptoms.\n8. Treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease\nGastroesophageal reflux needs to be treated aggressively by avoiding substances that easily cause reflux such as chocolate, caffeine, alcohol and tobacco; Prevent gastric reflux by keeping your head elevated and not eating for a few hours before going to bed. Additionally, treatment with proton pump inhibitors at maximum doses is possible.\n9. Treat neurological disorders that cause coughing\nThe treatment of cough due to neurological disorders needs to follow the doctor's instructions. Patients should not arbitrarily buy medicine because it can cause dangerous consequences.",
