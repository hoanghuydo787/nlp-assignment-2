During the incubation period, TB patients show no or few symptoms of the disease, so it is difficult to detect patients with the disease during this stage.\nIn advanced tuberculosis, depending on the level of disease in each organ, the patient will have different symptoms. In pulmonary tuberculosis, signs are often specific to the respiratory tract such as:\nDry cough, little cough, sometimes patients do not notice when they have a cough. If the patient has a persistent dry cough and mild fever for more than 3 weeks (possibly with afternoon fever), the doctor will prescribe a chest X-ray and a sputum test to look for tuberculosis bacilli.; Coughing up phlegm, phlegm is often white.; Coughing up blood (sputum mixed with blood) in quantity from small to large; Often there are symptoms of difficulty breathing, lung examination shows moist rales, crackles in the damaged area.",
