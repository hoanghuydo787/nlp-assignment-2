The main source of infection is people or animals infected with tuberculosis bacteria. The disease is easily transmitted when infected people or animals cough or sneeze, creating very small saliva particles containing many tuberculosis bacteria suspended in the air. People can breathe these particles into their lungs and get sick.\nToday, people divide tuberculosis pathology into 2 stages:\nTuberculosis stage: Tuberculosis bacteria first penetrate into the lungs causing primary infection, from there they spread through the lymphatic and bloodstream, possibly damaging a number of other organs.; Tuberculosis stage: For all ages, about 10% of infected tuberculosis will progress to tuberculosis and 80% of these tuberculosis will occur in the first 2 years of life. 50% of tuberculosis is a new source of infection in society.",
