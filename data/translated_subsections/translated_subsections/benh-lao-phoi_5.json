    "subsection_content": "Patients with tuberculosis are the biggest source of bacterial transmission to healthy people, especially pulmonary tuberculosis with positive AFB bacteria in sputum. If not treated early and using medication incorrectly, the disease can be life-threatening due to the following complications:\nEffusion, pneumothorax: Pleural effusion has lemon-yellow fluid, secretions containing many proteins and lymphocytes, sometimes pink or red fluid. Pneumothorax occurs when a tuberculous cavernous cavity connects to the pleural cavity. The main symptoms are sudden chest pain on the side of the pneumothorax and difficulty breathing. When too much air and fluid overflow, it will compress the lungs to a very small volume. This volume cannot provide enough air, causing the patient to suffocate and die. Therefore, it is necessary to immediately treat effusion and air to ease the patient's breathing.; Laryngeal tuberculosis: Often manifested by hoarseness, voice changes, painful swallowing, and ear pain. Examination often shows ulcers in the vocal cords or other places in the upper respiratory tract. Koch's bacillus sputum should be tested when the patient has progressive tuberculosis.; Pulmonary Aspergillus fungus: There are cases where tuberculosis has been cured but cavities are still left behind. These burrows can then become infected with the fungus Aspergillus fummigatus. Fungal infections can lead to severe hemoptysis and even death.; Chest wall fistula: If left untreated, or treated with insufficient drugs, not enough time, or drug-resistant tuberculosis, it can cause bronchial and chest wall fistulas.",
