    "subsection_content": "Peritoneal duct disease in boys is a disease that occurs due to abnormalities in the movement of the two testicles from the abdomen to the scrotum. Normally, during fetal life, a child's two testicles are formed and gradually develop in the abdomen. Towards the end of pregnancy, each testicle will create a passage called the peritoneal duct as it moves down into the scrotum. When this process is not complete, the child has peritoneal duct disease. Similarly in boys, if the round ligament in girls has difficulty moving down to the labia majora and is abnormal, it will also cause peritoneal duct diseases in girls.\nAccording to statistics, the rate of babies born with peritoneal duct disease is about 0.8 - 4.4% in full-term babies and up to 30% in premature babies. 80% of the peritoneal ducts are not occluded and this rate decreases rapidly in the first 6 months after birth.\n1. Inguinal hernias\nInguinal hernia is the most common type of hernia, can occur in both men and women, at any age. This is a condition in which abdominal organs and excess fat pass through natural holes in the groin (weak point of the abdominal wall), causing swelling or a small lump in the groin or scrotum, which can cause pain.\nInguinal hernias occur more often in men than in women. The incidence of this disease in male newborns ranges from 2-3% and less than 1% in female newborns.\nInguinal hernia in children\n2. Vitreous membrane\nHydrocele, also known as \"hydrocele disease\", is a condition in which after the testicles move to the scrotum, a small catheter from the abdomen to the child's scrotum remains, secreting fluid into the scrotum, causing the scrotum to swell and become swollen. . This condition is common in newborns and will disappear on its own when the child is 12 - 18 months old. In some cases, adult men can develop hydrocele due to inflammation or injury to the scrotum.\nNote, hydrocele does not cause pain for children, but if the child feels pain, parents need to take the child to the hospital for timely examination and medical intervention.\nHydrocele in children\n3. Sperm cord cyst\nSimilar to hydrocele, spermatic cord cysts in children also occur because the peritoneal tube still exists after the child is born, causing fluid to accumulate inside the scrotum, causing the scrotum to swell abnormally. However, the peritoneal tube in children with spermatic cord cysts is atrophied in the upper part, making it impossible for fluid to flow back into the abdominal wall.",
