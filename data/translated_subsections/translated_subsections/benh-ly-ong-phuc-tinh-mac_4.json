For suspected cases of hydrocele or inguinal hernia, the doctor may use a flashlight to examine more closely. If the bulge can push back into the abdomen, the child has an uninvolved inguinal hernia. At the same time, the doctor will check whether both testicles are in the scrotum or not during the examination.\nIn addition, the doctor may prescribe other medical procedures to support the diagnosis of the child's disease such as:\nSupersonic;; CT scan;; MRI scan.",
