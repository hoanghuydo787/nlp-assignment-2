(first)\nThere are two types of disease: acute coronary syndrome and chronic coronary artery disease:\nAcute coronary syndrome is a condition that includes unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction, occurring due to complete blockage of the coronary artery, acutely due to ruptured atherosclerotic plaque or thrombosis. ; In contrast, chronic coronary artery disease often occurs silently and progresses over decades. Symptoms of the disease appear and gradually increase as the progression of coronary stenosis worsens over time.",
