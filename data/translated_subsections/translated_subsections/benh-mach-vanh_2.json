    "subsection_content": "The most common cause of coronary artery disease is atherosclerotic plaque blocking the coronary arteries. The main risk factors that increase atherosclerosis include:\nHigh blood pressure condition; Diabetes; Lipid disorders; Smoke\nOnce the inner wall of a coronary artery is damaged, fatty deposits (plaques) made up of cholesterol and other cellular waste tend to accumulate at the damaged site. This process is called atherosclerosis. If the plaque surface is broken, blood cells (called platelets) will clump together here to try to repair the damage, forming a thrombus, completely blocking the coronary artery, leading to myocardial infarction.(3)\nCholesterol builds up and creates plaque in the artery walls, causing blockages and leading to narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries\nIn addition, people with the following factors are at increased risk of coronary artery disease:\nOlder age: the older you get, the higher your risk of atherosclerosis and narrowing of the arteries.; Family history of premature cardiovascular disease: in the family, a father or brother had the disease before age 55; or your mother or sister had this disease before age 65.; Overweight - obesity: people with a BMI > 23 will have an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease.; Sedentary lifestyle: increased risk of metabolic syndrome (hypertension, hyperglycemia, abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia), increased risk of disease.; Regular stress: excessive stress will damage arteries, increase inflammation, increase atherosclerosis, and promote rapid disease progression; Unhealthy diet: eating too much fatty foods, fatty meats, fried foods, canned foods, lots of salt and starch, sugar will increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.; Sleep apnea: the sudden decrease in blood oxygen levels that occurs during sleep apnea increases blood pressure and causes stress on the cardiovascular system, which is a favorable factor for coronary artery disease.; Some medical diseases such as chronic kidney failure, autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, etc.), familial dyslipidemia, etc. also increase the risk of atherosclerosis. circuit.",
