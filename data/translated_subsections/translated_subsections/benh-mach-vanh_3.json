(4)\nClinical tests needed to evaluate and diagnose chronic coronary artery disease include:\nElectrocardiogram to diagnose coronary artery disease; Cardiopulmonary X-ray; Color Doppler echocardiography; Exercise test: exercise electrocardiogram (if the patient can jog) or exercise echocardiography with Dobutamine (for the elderly, who cannot jog on rolling mats); Coronary CT angiography with contrast: helps check the level of blockage and calcification of the coronary arteries.; Cardiac catheterization, coronary angiography: usually performed when stress testing is positive or coronary CT angiography results show stenosis or when the patient needs coronary intervention. The doctor will insert a small tube into a blood vessel in the arm or thigh and push it up to the heart. Next, the doctor will inject contrast dye to see if the blood vessels feeding the heart are blocked or not. This is the gold standard for diagnosis. However, this is a method that penetrates the patient's body, so it is strictly prescribed to minimize complications.\nCoronary CT angiography with contrast helps diagnose coronary artery insufficiency",
