    "subsection_content": "Coronary artery disease can lead to dangerous complications such as:\nSudden death: about 30% - 50% of patients with acute myocardial infarction die suddenly before reaching the hospital.; Heart failure: due to prolonged myocardial ischemia or after myocardial infarction, causing the heart to become enlarged, have poor contraction, and leak the heart valves.; Severe valvular regurgitation is caused by rupture of the valvular ligament, prolapse of the valve leaflet, dilatation of the valve annulus, or abnormal contraction of the left ventricle. Ultimately, the heart becomes increasingly enlarged and heart failure becomes more severe.; Cardiac arrhythmias: such as atrioventricular block (needing a pacemaker), atrial fibrillation (can easily lead to cerebral infarction), ventricular extrasystoles due to scarring of the infarcted myocardium; More dangerous is ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation leading to sudden death.\nSee more: How long can you live with coronary artery disease?
