All treatments are aimed at increasing blood supply to the heart, reducing symptoms and prolonging the patient's life, including:\nThe basic treatment in all stages of the disease is lifestyle changes and medication.; Interventional treatment includes coronary angioplasty, stent placement, and coronary artery bypass surgery\n1. Change your lifestyle\nPatients must stop smoking, exercise regularly every day of the week, lose weight if overweight or obese, have a heart-healthy diet, and reduce alcohol.\nSay \"no\" to smoking to prevent and improve cardiovascular symptoms\n2. Treatment with medication\nIt is necessary to take medication regularly and for a long time, in which antiplatelet drugs must be taken for life, especially in people who have had a myocardial infarction, stent placement or coronary artery bypass surgery.\nAntiplatelet drugs: aspirin, clopidogrel, ticagrelor, prasugrel; Drugs that lower blood fat and reduce atherosclerosis: statin group (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin,..); Treatment of comorbidities such as high blood pressure and diabetes; Anti-anginal drugs: such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, nicorandil, ranolazine, trimetazidine,...\n3. Percutaneous coronary intervention and stent placement\nCoronary artery stents are small metal mesh frames inserted into the coronary artery to widen the narrowed artery and keep it from narrowing again.\n4. Coronary artery bypass surgery\nUse a segment of artery or vein as a bridge across the damaged coronary artery, connecting behind the narrow segment; Thus, blood will be supplied to the ischemic myocardial area behind the stenosis through the new bridge.\nAfter stent placement or bypass surgery, patients need to take medication regularly and change their lifestyle to avoid restenosis or blockage in the stent or coronary artery bypass graft.\nSee more: Can coronary artery disease be cured?
