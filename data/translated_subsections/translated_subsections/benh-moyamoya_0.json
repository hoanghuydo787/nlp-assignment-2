    "subsection_content": "The term “Moyamoya” in Japanese, refers to a mist or misty cloud. The disease is so named because the cerebral blood vessels are damaged and gradually narrowed, leading to increasingly insufficient cerebral blood flow to supply blood to the brain. The body will compensate by developing a secondary blood vessel network, including small neovascular vessels to try to compensate for cerebral ischemia - According to TTND. Associate Professor, Dr. Tran Duy Anh - Director of Internal Medicine , Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi.\nThese new blood vessels are very thin and fragile, causing brain hemorrhage. Therefore, in people with Moyamoya disease, when having a cerebral angiogram, the cerebral blood vessel network appears with a pale, hazy image as if covered by a thin cloud or a puff of smoke.\n“Moyamoya disease” is different from “Moyamoya syndrome”. In Moyamoya syndrome, patients show similar images of cerebral vascular damage, but the underdevelopment of the cerebral vascular network here is due to other mechanisms, not related to genetic mutations as in Moyamoya disease.
