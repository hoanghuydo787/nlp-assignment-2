    "subsection_content": "Associate Professor Tran Duy Anh said that Moyamoya disease can be treated with medication or surgery to control symptoms. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms, improve cerebral blood flow, and reduce the risk of serious complications such as ischemic stroke and fatal bleeding in the brain. The prognosis for Moyamoya disease depends on a number of factors such as age, whether the disease is detected early, damage that has occurred, whether the patient responds to treatment, etc. (3)\nDrug treatment\nA number of medications may be prescribed to help control symptoms, reduce the risk of stroke or assist in controlling seizures, including:\nBlood thinners: After being diagnosed with Moyamoya disease, if symptoms are mild or absent at first, your doctor may prescribe aspirin or another blood thinner to prevent stroke. ; Calcium channel blockers: Also known as calcium antagonists, this type of medication may be helpful in controlling headache symptoms and may reduce symptoms associated with transient ischemic attacks via. These medications can help control blood pressure, which is essential in people with Moyamoya disease to prevent brain damage.; Antiepileptic drugs: These drugs are prescribed for people who have seizures.

In direct revascularization surgery, the surgeon sutures (connects) the extracranial artery directly to the cerebral artery, for example: Bypassing the temporal artery to the middle cerebral artery to increase blood flow to the brain immediately.; Direct bypass surgery can be difficult to perform in children due to the small size of the blood vessels, but it is preferred in adults.
