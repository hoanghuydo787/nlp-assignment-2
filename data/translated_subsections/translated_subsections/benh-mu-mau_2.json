    "subsection_content": "1. Mechanism of color blindness\nIn the retina there are two types of cells that detect light: rods and cones. Rod cells detect light and darkness. Cone cells detect color and are concentrated near the center of the retina. There are three types of color vision cones: red, green, and blue. Reception and analysis of color are mainly responsible for these cone cells [5].\nColor blindness occurs when one or more cone cells are absent, inactive, or detect colors differently than normal. Severe color blindness without 3 cone cells. Mild color blindness occurs when there is enough but one cell that functions abnormally.\n2. What is the main cause of color blindness?\nGenetic\nColor blindness is a genetic disease related to sex chromosome pairs (in females XX, in males XY). The cause of color blindness is that the patient has a mutation or lack of a gene on the X chromosome, causing a disorder of the light receptor cells in the eye needed to distinguish colors (usually a recessive gene). Boys who receive this gene from their mothers will have difficulty distinguishing colors, because the Y chromosome does not have a dominant color gene to override the color blindness gene [6].\nComplications of diseases: diabetes, cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, alzheimer's, parkinson's, leukemia, macular degeneration, etc. can affect vision and cause color blindness.; Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON): people with this condition, even though they have no symptoms, still have impaired green-red vision. [7]; Some medications cause changes in color perception. For example, the anti-epileptic drug tiagabine has been shown to reduce color vision in about 41% of users, although these effects do not last long. There are also drugs to treat heart disease, high blood pressure, neurological disorders, etc.[8]; Age - aging: vision and the ability to distinguish colors also gradually decrease as age increases.; In addition, some toxic chemicals such as styrene found in plastic can also cause color blindness.",
