    "subsection_content": "There are 3 main types of color blindness: red-green color blindness, blue-yellow color blindness, and monochromatic color blindness. [ten]\nRed-green color blindness: this is the most common condition, patients have difficulty distinguishing between red and green. There are 4 types. Deuteranomaly: occurs due to the presence of an abnormal green cone pigment. This situation makes yellow and green look red, making purple and blue difficult to identify. This is the most common type. Protanomaly: occurs due to abnormal red pigmentation of cone cells. When the patient sees red, orange, or yellow, it will appear green and the colors will not be bright. The condition is mild and usually does not interfere with daily activities. Protanopia: this case is caused by red cone pigments stopping working. Red looks black. Deuteranopia: green cone pigments stop working. The patient will see red as yellow-brown, green as dark yellow.; Deuteranomaly: occurs due to the presence of an abnormal green cone pigment.

Red looks black.; Deuteranopia: green cone pigments stop working. The patient will see red as yellow-brown, green as dark yellow.; Blue-yellow color blindness: less common, patients have difficulty distinguishing blue - green, yellow - red. There are two types of blue-yellow color blindness. Tritanomaly: occurs because the blue cone pigments have limited function. Blue looks green, making it difficult to distinguish between red and yellow. Tritanopia: people suffer from this condition due to a lack of blue pigment. Accordingly, blue looks like green, pink looks like purple or light brown.; Tritanomaly: occurs because the blue cone pigments have limited function. Blue looks green, hard to distinguish red - yellow.; Tritanopia: people suffer from this condition due to a lack of blue pigment. Accordingly, blue looks like green, pink looks like purple or light brown.; Monochromacy: in this case the patient cannot see colors. There are 2 types of monochromatic color blindness. [11] Rod color blindness (RM): a rare autosomal recessive retinal disorder. Rod cells do not have any pigment. People with this condition only see 3 colors: white, black, gray. At the same time, I feel uncomfortable when being in a space with lots of light. Cone color blindness (CM): two of the three cone pigments do not work. Therefore, the brain does not receive signals, so it is difficult for the patient to distinguish colors.; Rod color blindness (RM): a rare autosomal recessive retinal disorder.
