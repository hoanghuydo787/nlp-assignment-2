    "subsection_content": "Dog tapeworm (also known as dog tapeworm, dog tapeworm, flea tapeworm, cucumber tapeworm, two-hole tapeworm) has the scientific name Dipylidium Caninum, is a type of tapeworm that often parasitizes dogs and cats. This tapeworm can also be found in humans, especially children. Some reports also show that hydatid disease is transmitted by wild cats, tropical forest cats, civets, ferrets, hyenas, jackals, wild or semi-domesticated Australian dogs and foxes. (first)\nDog flukes are light pink in color, about 10-70cm long with 175 elliptical or long segments. The segments near the head are usually short and thin, about 0.2mm wide. Immature fluke segments near the neck are wider than long, and when mature, they become more square. When mature, the segments are 27 x 12mm in size and contain eggs.\nEach segment of the adult fluke contains both male and female reproductive organs, located on both sides of the segment. The testes of adult tapeworms contain 100-200 egg follicles, each follicle has 8-15 eggs. The tapeworm egg shell is thin, spherical, 35-40mm in size, with a fluke embryo containing 3 pairs of hooks. The uterus in the fluke segments develops in a network shape with the ovary having a yolk gland.\nThe fluke's head is diamond-shaped, 0.25-0.5mm in size with 4 cup-shaped suction discs. The dog tapeworm's proboscis is rod-shaped, with 1-7 rows of teeth. Depending on the age of the fluke, the row of teeth at the nozzle can protrude or retract.",
