    "subsection_content": "Dog tapeworms are often parasitic in the small intestine of infected dogs. Old tapeworm segments containing eggs break into segments or short segments and then move to the outside environment through the anus or dog feces. Each segment of the tapeworm releases eggs into the environment, sticking to the dog's fur or anus.\nDogs have a habit of licking all over the body, daily living objects and the human body, so tapeworm eggs accidentally spread everywhere. In addition, when flea species such as Ctenocephalides canis, C. felis felis, C. felis orientis swallow dog fluke eggs into the intestine, the fluke embryos develop into larval cysts with tails (cercocysts). Then, people, especially children, accidentally swallow fleas or tapeworm eggs while playing with dogs, and the dog tapeworms will parasitize in the human body.\nDogs can also eat fleas containing tapeworm eggs or larvae. At this time, dog tapeworms continue to parasitize in the dog's small intestine and continue a new life cycle.\nDog tapeworms are a type of tapeworm that often parasitizes dogs and cats.
