    "subsection_content": "There are many causes of tapeworm disease such as: hugging and caressing dogs infected with tapeworms, eating food containing tapeworm larvae or eggs, contact with soil where infected dogs defecate, etc. Speed ​​of spread and development of dog tapeworm disease depends on living habits, frequency of eating dog tapeworm-contaminated food, frequency of contact with dogs and the area of ​​land contaminated with dog feces.\nDog flukes are not transmitted from person to person because dog flukes are the specific cause of disease in dogs. The development cycle of dog tapeworms forms in the dog's intestines, passes out through the anus, and then accidentally infects humans. When parasitic in the human body, dog flukes do not create a new life cycle. At the same time, dog tapeworms do not move through blood and breast milk, so they cannot be transmitted from mother to child.\nDog tapeworms often cause itchy rashes, hives, etc. on the skin.
