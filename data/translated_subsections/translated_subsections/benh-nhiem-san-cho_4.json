    "subsection_content": "Children are susceptible to dog tapeworms because they often play in the ground and sand where dogs once defecated. In addition, the dog's anus is where many tapeworm eggs are found. Dogs have the habit of licking the anus, hair, all over the body, and licking human household items, so tapeworm eggs are spread everywhere. At the same time, the habit of petting and hugging dogs also makes people susceptible to dog tapeworm infection.\nCysticariasis is not transmitted directly from person to person. But if you eat dirty foods contaminated with dog tapeworm eggs or vegetables, tubers, and fruits grown in areas with dog feces but are not washed or cooked thoroughly, you will easily get dog tapeworm disease. At the same time, people who often eat dog and cat meat, or eat raw vegetables, are also at higher risk of being infected with dog tapeworms.\nOne of the factors that increases the risk of infection with hydatid disease is contact with the feces of dogs, cattle, pigs or sheep. Therefore, people who raise and trade livestock, dogs, cats, etc. have a higher risk of dog tapeworm infection.",
