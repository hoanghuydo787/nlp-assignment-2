    "subsection_content": "Hydatid disease is difficult to recognize with the naked eye, so many symptoms are confused with other diseases. When you have suspicious signs, you should see a doctor to be prescribed medical tests to accurately diagnose whether or not you have dog tapeworm infection.\nCurrently, the Examination Department and Laboratory Department at Tam Anh General Hospital have leading experts and doctors with extensive experience in screening and accurately diagnosing Dipylidium caninum disease. The patient will be examined, tested, and given other necessary instructions such as CT scan or ultrasound to find cysts, segments, or segment segments crawling out in the anus or stool. Dog tapeworm eggs are rarely found in feces, although when the tapeworm segments are destroyed, eggs can still be found in the stool.\nIn addition, the patient will be diagnosed with a serological test (blood test such as Elisa) to detect antibodies. When humans eat dog tapeworms, anti-dog tapeworm antibodies will appear about 2 weeks later and last for a long time. Elisa technique will help doctors detect anti-dog fluke antibodies even when the dog fluke has died or been excreted after 2-8 years.\nBesides, doctors can detect that patients are infected with dog tapeworms when performing medical tests to check their health.",
