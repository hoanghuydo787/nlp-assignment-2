Symptoms of muscle weakness are often seen in the eye muscles (ptosis), extraocular muscles, neck, shoulder, hip muscles, or respiratory muscles (fatigued breathing).

This reduces the ability to conduct nerve transmission across the synaptic gap, manifested by muscle fatigue, muscle weakness or motor paralysis.",
