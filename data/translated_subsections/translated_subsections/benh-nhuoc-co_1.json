    "subsection_content": "Eye muscles\nMore than 50% of patients with myasthenia gravis have initial symptoms in the eye muscles. Patients often have signs such as:\nPtosis: unilateral or asymmetrical appearance; Double vision: The patient sees one object but sees two images.; Other symptoms: difficulty closing eyes completely.\nAbout 15% of people with myasthenia gravis have symptoms only in the eyes. However, symptoms can spread to other muscles in the body over several weeks, months or years.\nPharyngeal muscles\nChewing muscles are often affected and become weaker when chewing for a long time (chewing fatigue). Patients often see this happen during meals, especially when chewing something difficult like beef. When chewing muscles are weak, patients often use their hand under the jaw to close their mouth.\nWeakness of the muscles in the oropharynx causes difficulty swallowing and difficulty speaking. The patient's voice changes to a nasal voice when the palate muscles are weak, and becomes worse when speaking for a long time. In addition, patients may have difficulty swallowing when eating and drinking, especially causing aspiration, respiratory failure or pneumonia due to food falling into the lungs.\nNeck and quadriceps muscles\nMuscle weakness can appear in other parts such as the neck, arms, and legs. Patients often have signs such as:\nHaving difficulty keeping the head up due to weak neck extensors, the weight of the head is large, often causing \"dropping head syndrome\" especially at the end of the day.; Difficulty performing activities such as lifting objects, getting up from a sitting position, climbing stairs or brushing teeth.; The gait is heavy and inflexible.\nFacial muscles\nFacial muscles are often affected and cause the patient to have an expressionless face. Relatives may notice that the patient has \"lost his smile\" and has weak orbicularis oculi muscles.\nRespiratory muscles\nAffected respiratory muscles cause severe signs of myasthenia gravis. Weakness of respiratory muscles causes respiratory failure. Respiratory failure pending emergency treatment is a life-threatening situation known as a “myasthenic crisis.” This situation can occur suddenly or be precipitated by other factors such as surgery, infection, or certain immunosuppressive medications.",
