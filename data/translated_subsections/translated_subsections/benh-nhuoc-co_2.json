These antibodies appear in about 85 percent of people with generalized myasthenia gravis. AChR antibody testing is quite specific in diagnosing myasthenia gravis and is best performed before initiating immunosuppressive therapy.; MuSK antibodies – MuSK antibodies are present in 38 to 50% of people with AChR-Ab negative myasthenia gravis. These patients often have ocular manifestations (eg, diplopia and ptosis), which are often symmetrical and less severe and less fluctuating than the ocular manifestations of AChR myasthenia gravis. positive.; LRP4 Antibodies – Antibodies against LRP4, an agrin receptor required to trigger MuSK and AChR receptor formation. LRP4 is present in approximately 13% of patients with negative AChR and MuSK antibody serology. Patients usually have mild symptoms, but at the maximum level of disease, patients with LRP4 antibodies have more severe clinical symptoms than patients without positive antibodies. Most patients improve with standard immunosuppressive therapy.\nAntibody-negative myasthenia gravis – Use for people who are negative for AChR and MuSK antibodies or more rarely LRP4. Seronegative patients with myasthenia gravis respond similarly to Pyridostigmine, plasma exchange, glucocorticoid and other immunosuppressive therapies, as well as thymectomy.\nThe thymus is an organ of the immune system, located in the chest just below the sternum. This organ can maintain or trigger the production of antibodies that block acetylcholine. The thymus is usually large in newborns and small in healthy adults. However, in adults with myasthenia gravis, the size of the thymus may be abnormally large.\nIn addition, some patients may also develop tumors in the thymus. Most thymoma are benign tumors. Sometimes, tumors can also become cancerous.\nOther factors\nGenetic factors – it appears that genetic factors also contribute to the pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis. Several human leukocyte antigens (HLA) have been implicated in myasthenia gravis, including HLA-B8, DRw3, and DQw2. MuSK antibody-positive myasthenia gravis may be associated with DR14 and DQ5.\nIn addition, people with myasthenia gravis often have other immune-mediated diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Graves' disease and thyroiditis, and a family history of the disease. autoimmune disorder.",
