    "subsection_content": "In the early stages of myasthenia gravis, most patients experience transient symptoms, going several hours, days, or even weeks without symptoms. Symptoms may even subside spontaneously over weeks or longer. However, the symptoms are often more severe and last longer. New symptoms often develop weeks or months later.\nProgression of myasthenia gravis usually peaks within a few years of disease onset. In a series of patients with myasthenia gravis in the United States in 1976, the disease reached its maximum severity within 2 years in 82% of patients. In another study of 1,152 patients in Italy, the maximum severity of this disease after 3 years of onset was 77%.\nFor those with ocular manifestations, an important question is whether they will develop generalized myasthenia gravis. About 50% of patients develop generalized myasthenia after two years. There are no factors that predict which patients with ocular myasthenia gravis will develop generalized myasthenia gravis. The presence of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies, repetitive nerve stimulation testing, or single fiber electromyography do not predict disease progression.\nMost clinicians believe that there are three stages of the disease:\nStage 1: Initial active stage with many fluctuating symptoms. Severe cases of muscle weakness occur five to seven years after onset. Most acute myasthenic attacks occur during this early period.; Stage 2: In this stage, the disease condition is more stable. Symptoms, although stable, persist and may worsen in the setting of infection, drug withdrawal, or other disorders.; Stage 3: At this stage, many cases of the disease may be in remission. Patients have no symptoms when treated with immunosuppressive therapy, or even stop taking medication completely.\nMyasthenia gravis can get worse very quickly or the weakness can suddenly appear severe, especially respiratory muscle weakness. This is the most worrying and dangerous complication of the disease. Respiratory failure is due to the patient's weakness or paralysis of the respiratory muscles including the diaphragm, intercostal muscles and chest wall muscles. In many cases, respiratory muscles are completely paralyzed, leading to rapid death if there is no timely treatment.",
