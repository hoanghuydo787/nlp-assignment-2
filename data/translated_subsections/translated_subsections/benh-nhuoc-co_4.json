In addition to neurological assessment and general examination, the doctor will ask the patient to answer questions such as: (2)\nDoes muscle weakness fluctuate during activity and rest, or between morning and afternoon?; Do you see your eyes open wide when you first wake up, then your eyelids gradually droop?; Is it possible to see 1 thing as 2?; Do you have difficulty swallowing, choking, or speaking?; If the patient is a newborn, is the baby not crying, feeding poorly, or choking on milk after birth?; Does any family member have myasthenia gravis?\nAfter asking the patient's medical history, the doctor will diagnose myasthenia gravis by doing a clinical examination including:\nCheck for signs of drooping eyelids on one or both sides; Check eye movement, signs of crossed eyes, double vision; Check for weakness in facial muscles; Muscle weakness in the arms and legs; Examination of tendon reflexes; Check for signs of respiratory muscle weakness; Check for sensory symptoms and signs\nIn addition, the doctor may prescribe the patient to undergo a number of other tests including:\nProstigmin test: The patient is injected with an anti-cholinesterase drug so that the AChR molecules are slowly destroyed. The result is positive when the symptoms of muscle weakness are clearly reduced.; Ice test: use an ice pack placed on the eye with drooping eyelids, test positive when the eye opens wider.; Electromyography: perform repetitive nerve stimulation test or single fiber electromyography.; Serum testing for antibodies against AChR, MuSK, LPR4 (highly valuable in diagnosing myasthenia gravis and monitoring and predicting disease).; Chest CT screening for thymoma",
