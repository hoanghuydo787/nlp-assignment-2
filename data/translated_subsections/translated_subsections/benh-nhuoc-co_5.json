    "subsection_content": "Myasthenia gravis is a chronic but treatable disease. Patients can have sustained relief from symptoms and have full function. The main goal of treating myasthenia gravis is to help the patient minimize symptoms, and even better, to minimize side effects of the medication. (3)\nThere are 4 therapies used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis:\nSymptomatic treatment (Acetylcholinesterase inhibition) increases the amount of Acetylcholine (ACh) available at the neuromuscular synapse.; Chronic immunosuppressive therapies (Glucocorticoids and non-steroidal immunosuppressants) to target immune dysregulation; Surgical treatment (thymectomy).; Acute but short-acting immunomodulatory treatments (plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion).\nAvoid using medications that can worsen myasthenia gravis\nSome drugs, such as aminoglycosides and muscle relaxants, have caused pharmacological side effects that oppose neuromuscular transmission. Using these drugs will worsen the symptoms of people with myasthenia gravis. In particular, many drugs can push patients into life-threatening myasthenic attacks in case reports. Although cause and effect have not been established for most of these drugs, they should be used with caution in people with myasthenia gravis.\nSome drugs should be used with caution:\nAll drugs that depress breathing (e.g., Benzodiazepines, Opioids, sedatives); Fluoroquinolone antibiotics (e.g. Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin); Aminoglycosides should be avoided and used only if absolutely necessary and with close monitoring; Telithromycin can cause acute myasthenic crisis, usually within 2 hours after the first dose; Muscle relaxants (e.g., Cisatracurium, enflurane, isoflurane, halothane) should be used with caution; Magnesium Sulfate has relative contraindications because of inhibition of ACh release; Certain cardiovascular medications, such as all beta-blockers, should be used with caution.; Statins (e.g., Atorvastatin Rosuvastatin) have occasionally been reported to worsen myasthenia gravis. However, Statins are not contraindicated in patients with myasthenia gravis and should be used in patients with appropriate indications.\n1. Symptomatic treatment – ​​Pyridostigmine\nInitial therapy for most patients with mild to moderate myasthenia gravis is an oral acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (ie, anticholinesterase), usually Pyridostigmine. Neostigmine is available in oral form but is not commonly used.\nMechanism of action – Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors slow down the degradation of acetylcholine (ACh) that occurs by enzymatic hydrolysis in the neuromuscular synapse. Therefore, the effects of ACh are prolonged, leading to improved strength in patients with myasthenia gravis.\n2. Immunosuppressive therapies\nFor patients who only take Pyridostigmine and whose symptoms are well controlled or relieved, doctors only need to monitor their clinical progress. Although some patients respond well to long-term use of Pyridostigmine alone, most patients with generalized myasthenia gravis require immunosuppressive therapy at some point, not indefinitely.\nImmunosuppressive therapy is indicated for patients who remain significantly symptomatic with Pyridostigmine or who return to symptoms after a temporary response to Pyridostigmine. Glucocorticoids are often used initially and many patients with generalized myasthenia gravis require the addition of nonsteroidal immunosuppressants such as Azathioprine or Mycophenolate for maintenance and to prevent long-term side effects of Glucocorticoids.\n3. Thymectomy\nIn parallel with symptomatic treatment with Pyridostigmine and immunosuppressive drugs for myasthenia gravis, thymectomy has a therapeutic role in selected patients.\nPatients with thymoma: About 10 to 15% of patients with myasthenia gravis have thymoma. Thymectomy is indicated for patients in whom complete resection is considered feasible. Management includes complete thymectomy, sometimes involving chemotherapy and radiotherapy in cases of completely resectable or unresectable disease; Patients without thymoma: Thymectomy is recommended in the absence of thymoma in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis and positive Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies under 50 years of age. The benefits of thymectomy may be delayed and last for several years after surgery. The role of thymectomy in other patient groups, such as those who are not AChR antibody positive, older patients, and those with ocular myasthenia gravis, is controversial and treatment decisions Treatment should be individualized.\n4. Treatment of acute exacerbation\nMyasthenia gravis – Worsening of myasthenic symptoms may be caused by: concomitant infection, surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, certain medications, reduction of immunosuppressive medications, or spontaneously as a part of the natural history of the disease. When severe, patients are at risk of life-threatening respiratory failure called myasthenic crisis.; Plasma exchange and IVIG infusion are rescue or bridge therapy – Plasmapheresis or IVIG infusion has a “rapid” immunomodulatory effect for myasthenia gravis, but the benefit is only short-term (a few week).\nThese treatment methods are indicated in the following cases:\nAcute exacerbations, including myasthenic crisis; Before surgery, before thymectomy or other surgery.; As a \"bridge\" to slower-acting immunosuppressive therapies for patients who specifically wish to avoid or minimize Glucocorticoid use.",
