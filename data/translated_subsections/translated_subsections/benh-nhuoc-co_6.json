    "subsection_content": "If patients with generalized myasthenia gravis have additional respiratory infections, they are at increased risk of myasthenic attacks and respiratory tract damage.\nCurrent guidelines recommend annual seasonal influenza vaccination for all people receiving immunosuppressive therapy and for people with neurological conditions, including neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis. systemic muscle and ocular myasthenia within three years of onset.\nPneumococcal vaccination should be given to all patients with generalized myasthenia gravis and ocular myasthenia gravis. Based on several studies, inactivated influenza vaccine (intramuscular injection) is safe in adults with myasthenia gravis. Furthermore, inactivated vaccines (eg, pneumococcal and intramuscular vaccines) are generally considered safe in adults or children who have immunocompromised conditions or are taking immunosuppressive medications.\nHowever, live attenuated zoster vaccine is not recommended for patients with immunocompromised conditions or taking immunosuppressive medications.",
