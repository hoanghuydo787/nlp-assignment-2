However, COVID-19 infection and severe infections cause acute myasthenia gravis in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy.\nGuidelines for the care of patients with myasthenia gravis during the COVID-19 pandemic have been issued by multiple expert groups, including an international panel of myasthenia gravis experts. In general, patients should continue existing therapies unless there is a clinical reason to change, as reducing or discontinuing medication carries the risk of worsening myasthenia gravis.\nTelemedicine appointments, as an alternative to in-person visits, may reduce the risk of exposure.; COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for patients with autoimmune diseases such as myasthenia gravis, unless they have specific contraindications, such as an allergy to a component of the vaccine.",
