The level of vibration gradually increases when the patient is too focused or emotional. When the patient goes to sleep or exercises, this Parkinson's sign will temporarily disappear and recur soon after.; Parkinson's disease causes patients to have difficulty moving, unable to move quickly, and operations become less flexible. The patient's gait becomes abnormal, the speed of movement decreases, the distance between steps becomes shorter.; The muscles and bones of people with Parkinson's disease begin to stiffen, making it difficult to move as desired.
