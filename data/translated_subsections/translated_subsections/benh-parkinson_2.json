    "subsection_content": "The cause of Parkinson's disease is that basal ganglia neurons (a group of gray nuclei located deep in the cerebral hemispheres that regulate human movement) are weakened and/or lost. Normally, these nerve cells produce a chemical called dopamine. When neurons in the basal ganglia die or are weakened, they produce less dopamine, reducing stimulation to the cerebral cortex and causing the patient to have difficulty moving.\nHowever, up to now, the exact cause of nerve cells dying and leading to Parkinson's disease has not been found. Therefore, it can be said that the cause of Parkinson's has not yet been specifically determined.\nSome factors believed to be associated with the risk of Parkinson's disease include: (4)\nAge: The older you get, the faster the amount of dopamine in the body decreases.; Environment: Frequent exposure to toxic chemicals such as herbicides, pesticides, etc. increases the risk of Parkinson's disease.; Traumatic brain injury: People with a history of traumatic brain injury are more susceptible to Parkinson's disease than normal people.; Genetics: Some cases of Parkinson's are believed to be related to genetics. If someone in your family has had Parkinson's disease, your risk of developing the disease is also higher.\nThe exact cause of Parkinson's disease has not been found",
