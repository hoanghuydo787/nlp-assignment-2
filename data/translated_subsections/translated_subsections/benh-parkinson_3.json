    "subsection_content": "Based on the Parkinson's syndrome assessment scale according to Hoehn and Yahr, Parkinson's disease is divided into 5 main stages of progression:\n1. Stage 1: Symptoms appear on one side of the body\nIn the first stage, Parkinson's disease symptoms do not appear clearly, the patient only feels slight numbness and tremors on one side of the body, and occasionally has muscle spasms. The disease does not have much impact on the patient's daily life, so many people do not know they are sick or are subjective and do not go to the hospital for examination and diagnosis.\n2. Stage 2: Symptoms appear on both sides of the body, and postural reflexes remain\nIn the next progressive stage of Parkinson's disease, the patient may feel more obvious signs. Specifically, the muscles become increasingly stiff, making it difficult for the patient to move and their gait changes. Arms, legs and other organs on both sides of the body begin to tremble and shake more. The face of a person with stage 2 Parkinson's disease has little expression due to muscle tension and cannot express emotions on the face.\nDepending on each patient, the time it takes for the disease to progress from stage 1 to stage 2 lasts from several months to several years.\n3. Stage 3: Reduced motor reflexes, difficulty maintaining balance\nIn stage 3 of Parkinson's disease, the patient begins to have many difficulties in daily activities. Specifically, patients have difficulty maintaining balance and easily fall while performing daily tasks and activities. At this stage, shaking symptoms become more and more serious.\nHowever, if detected and treated promptly, symptoms of stage 3 Parkinson's disease can still be improved and significantly reduced.\n4. Stage 4: Limited movement, can only move a short distance\nEntering stage 4 of Parkinson's disease, the patient is no longer able to perform daily activities due to muscle stiffness. Movements are performed extremely slowly, and the patient can only stand for a short time. In addition, at this stage, the patient has many difficulties moving, can only walk short distances and needs a lot of support and care from surrounding relatives.\n5. Stage 5: Cannot walk independently\nStage 5 is considered the most serious stage of the disease. Patients have symptoms such as shaking limbs, stiff muscles, and being unable to walk on their own. In most cases, people with stage 5 Parkinson's disease are bedridden or need wheelchairs, completely dependent on relatives. At this time, treatment medications are less effective.\nPatients with stage 5 Parkinson's disease cannot walk on their own",
