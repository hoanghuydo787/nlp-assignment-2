    "subsection_content": "If Parkinson's disease is not treated, it can cause numbness, tremors, even disability, and can lead to falls, which can be life-threatening. Therefore, when you detect signs of Parkinson's disease, you should see a doctor for treatment advice as soon as possible.\nMeasures commonly applied to treat and prevent the disease from getting worse include:\n1. Treatment with medication\nDoctors may prescribe patients to use medications such as:\nDopamine agonists: These drugs directly stimulate dopamine receptors. Dopamine agonists include ropinirole, pramipexole, rotigotine, and apomorphine.; Dopamine replacement drugs: These are drugs such as syndopa, sinemer, madopar, etc. These drugs have the ability to promptly replenish the deficient amount of dopamine in patients. However, it should be noted not to combine the drug with vitamin B6 during use; Dopamine catabolism inhibitors: Drugs that help prolong the activity of dopamine in the patient's body. In Vietnam, this drug is currently rarely used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Typical dopamine catabolic inhibitors include monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as selegiline and COM inhibitors such as tolcapone.; Anticholinergic drugs: Drugs that have the ability to block the action of acetylcholine. The typical form of the drug is benztropine. This line of drugs to treat Parkinson's symptoms can cause some side effects such as drowsiness, dry mouth, reduced salivation, constipation, etc.\nSome medications help improve Parkinson's symptoms\nNormally, in the first stage of treatment, patients are only given low doses of the drug. The doctor will base on the patient's response to the drug and decide whether to continue taking the drug in gradually increasing amounts or change to another drug.\n2. Surgical treatment\nIn cases where medication cannot improve the signs of Parkinson's disease, the patient may be referred for surgery. Surgical methods for patients with Parkinson's disease include stereotactic surgery, electrical stimulation surgery of the substantia nigra and nerve tissue grafting.\n3. Rehabilitation\nBesides using medication, people with Parkinson's disease can also combine rehabilitation measures to improve their condition:\nApplying speech therapy can improve speech and swallowing disorders.; Physical therapy is a way to help people with Parkinson's disease reduce balance disorders as well as increase mobility.; Patients can also practice yoga, tai chi, etc. to limit movement disorders, overcome symptoms of muscle spasticity or tremors, etc.",
