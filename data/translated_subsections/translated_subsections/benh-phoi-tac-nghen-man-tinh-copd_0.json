    "subsection_content": "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammation of the airway mucosa that causes reduced ventilation function in the lungs. Patients often feel difficulty breathing because the airways are narrower than normal and can lead to respiratory failure. (2)\nThe disease can be treated to slow down its progression when detected at an early stage to avoid dangerous complications.\nCOPD is a very common disease, the incidence rate is 2% of the population in Hanoi and 5.65% in Hai Phong (according to research by Prof. Dr. Ngo Quy Chau and colleagues). In the field of hospital treatment, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is also the disease with the highest proportion in respiratory disease departments. Doctor Ngo Quy Chau also said: \"The actual incidence of the disease is higher than the statistics because many people do not have the habit of regular health check-ups. Even in cases where symptoms appear, patients still subjectively do not go to the doctor.”\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease is divided into two types, including:\nChronic bronchitis: A condition in which the lining of the bronchial tubes becomes inflamed. The lining of the bronchopulmonary tubes is swollen, red and filled with mucus. These mucus are the cause of narrowing of the airways.\nEmphysema is a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Emphysema causes difficulty breathing due to long-term damage to the lung alveoli, causing the alveoli to weaken and burst, replacing small spaces with large spaces, causing a decrease in lung surface area, reducing lung function. amount of oxygen entering the blood.",
