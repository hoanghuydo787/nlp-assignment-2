    "subsection_content": "Symptoms of the disease are often unclear and easily confused with other respiratory diseases until lung damage occurs and often become more severe over time, especially with continued exposure to cigarette smoke. Damage in chronic pulmonary obstruction is initially mainly concentrated in small bronchial branches with a diameter of <2mm and lung parenchyma.(8)\nEarly signs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may include:\nFeeling short of breath, especially during physical activities;; Wheeze;; Chest tightness;; Prolonged cough with phlegm;; Frequent respiratory infections;; Lack of energy;; Unintended weight loss (in the later stages);; Swelling in the ankles, feet or legs; Mild fever and chills\nSufferers are also likely to experience exacerbations in which the above symptoms may become worse than the usual daily variation and last at least a few days. In severe cases, hospitalization, antibiotic treatment, mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, etc. may be required, respiratory function is reduced, and survival time is shortened.\nWhen symptoms appear in the initial stages, patients often subjectively believe that coughs and phlegm are normal diseases. Since then, there has been no timely intervention, leading to continued progression until symptoms of continuous difficulty breathing appeared. Initially, shortness of breath often only appears when exerting, as time goes on, shortness of breath appears more frequently, and in the final stage the patient feels short of breath even while resting in bed.\nTo assess the level of dyspnea, you can use the grading scale according to author Sadoul: (6)\nLevel 0: No difficulty breathing when climbing stairs; Level 1: Difficulty breathing when climbing stairs from the 2nd floor or higher; Level 2: Difficulty climbing uphill; Level 3: Shortness of breath when walking at normal speed on the road with others; Level 4: Difficulty breathing when walking at a normal speed and frequently having to stop to rest; Level 5: Difficulty breathing when performing daily tasks such as getting dressed, brushing teeth and washing face",
