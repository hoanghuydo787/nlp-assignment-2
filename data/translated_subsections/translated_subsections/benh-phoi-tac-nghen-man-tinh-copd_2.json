    "subsection_content": "According to Prof. Dr. Ngo Quy Chau, there are 2 factors that can be the cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:\nIntrinsic factors include: Genetic deficiencies and defects such as alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency; Factors caused by environmental pollution: Cigarette smoke, pipe tobacco, exhaust fumes, industrial toxic gases...\nSmoking accounts for more than 90% of cases. About 20-30% of people who smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day will have early or late symptoms of COPD. (3)\nAcute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to occupational dust exposure occurs in about 10% of cases. Miners, construction workers, weavers, workers at metallurgical factories, and farmers are people who are often exposed to bronchial irritants, leading to a high risk of disease. Pathogenic factors include: toxic gases, cement, coal products, silica dust and stimulants used in agriculture.\nCOPD exacerbation is an acute change in respiratory symptoms from a stable stage of the disease to a sudden deterioration that exceeds daily fluctuations, requiring a change in the routine treatment of COPD patients.\nOther factors such as air poisoning are not a direct cause, but can also affect the development of the disease, including: Containing factors that worsen the disease in the long term and increase the risk of death in people people with severe respiratory failure.",
