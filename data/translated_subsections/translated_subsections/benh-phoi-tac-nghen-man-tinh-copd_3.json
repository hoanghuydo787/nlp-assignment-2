The diagnosis is determined when a fixed obstructive ventilation disorder is found.\nPulmonary function measurement (spirometry) is a test that allows testing and detecting the severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD. This test gives precise information about the flow of air in the bronchi and in the lungs. This is a fairly simple examination and causes almost no pain, discomfort or complications for the patient.
