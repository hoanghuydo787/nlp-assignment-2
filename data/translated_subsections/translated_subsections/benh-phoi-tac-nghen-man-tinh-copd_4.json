    "subsection_content": "If not detected and intervened early, COPD can cause a number of serious complications, affecting the patient's health, quality of life, and even endangering life.\n1. Pneumothorax\nPatients with severe disease have prolonged airway obstruction, leading to the amount of air inhaled in the alveoli not being fully exhaled. This increased amount of accumulated air causes the alveoli to stretch, thin and easily rupture into the pleural cavity, causing pneumothorax. The patient's life will be threatened if this condition persists and is not resolved.\n2. Heart disease\nIn the severe stages of the disease, air entering and leaving the lungs is obstructed and not renewed regularly. In addition, the walls of the alveoli (air sacs of the lungs) are also destroyed, further hindering the exchange of air. gas exchange, thus reducing the oxygen concentration in the blood, accumulating a lot of carbon dioxide. Frequent lack of oxygen will affect the functioning of organs, especially the heart.\nNot only that, the more damage to the bronchi and alveoli causes blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation to increase, the heart has to work harder, leading to dilation and even right heart failure over time.\n3. Reduced lifespan\nEven patients with mild disease have a shorter life span than normal; the more severe the COPD, the shorter their life span. Most patients are diagnosed when the disease is severe or very severe. Only about 70% of patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 30% of very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease survive 5 years after disease detection.\nAbout 30% of patients die from acute and chronic respiratory failure, followed by heart failure (13%). The next causes of death include: Respiratory infection, pulmonary infarction, cardiac arrhythmia, lung cancer.\n4. Disability\nAccording to Prof. Dr. Ngo Bao Chau, COPD is a disease that has the potential to cause high disability. Comparing the World Health Organization's disability standards, the disease's disability is due to the following main points:\nRespiratory disability: difficulty breathing and muscle pain will reduce mobility; Social disability: the patient will feel isolated from society and must depend on others for daily activities. Prolonged condition can lead to depression and seriously impaired quality of life. About 60% of patients are prescribed long-term oxygen breathing, these cases often require lying in place for 16-18 hours/day, further increasing the patient's depression.",
