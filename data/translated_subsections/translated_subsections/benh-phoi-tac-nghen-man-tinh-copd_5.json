    "subsection_content": "To date, there is no method that can completely cure COPD. However, if you strictly follow your doctor's instructions, you can control your condition and reduce the number of exacerbations requiring hospitalization.\nWhen being treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, patients should pay attention to following these instructions:\nQuit smoking, avoid exposure to secondhand smoke;; Use medicine as prescribed by your doctor, in the right dosage, and in the right way;; Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination;; Understand the disease and the signs that require a change in treatment, a doctor's visit, or emergency hospitalization.\nMedications that help reduce disease symptoms include corticosteroids and bronchodilators. In general, inhaled and sprayed drugs are often preferred over oral or intravenous drugs. Treatment with bronchodilators is indicated when there is difficulty breathing, however the effectiveness of bronchodilators in COPD is not always as desired.\nPhysiotherapy is a treatment to help relieve bronchial obstruction by secretions during acute exacerbations and is also a treatment to restore pulmonary function.; Physiotherapy is a treatment to help relieve bronchial obstruction by secretions during acute exacerbations and is also a treatment to restore lung function.\nOxygen therapy (Oxygen therapy) is indicated in the stage of respiratory failure when the patient lacks oxygen in the blood.; Oxygen therapy (Oxygen therapy) is indicated at the stage of respiratory failure when the patient lacks oxygen in the blood.\nNon-invasive mechanical ventilation may be indicated in cases of severe respiratory failure and respiratory muscle fatigue; Non-invasive mechanical ventilation may be indicated in cases of severe respiratory failure and respiratory muscle fatigue\nEndobronchial one-way valve placement and volume reduction surgery are offered in special cases to treat the consequences of alveolar dilatation. Alveolar ectasia lesions are not concentrated in one place, so surgery can only remove some lesions.; Endobronchial one-way valve placement and volume reduction surgery are offered in special cases to treat the consequences of alveolar dilatation.
