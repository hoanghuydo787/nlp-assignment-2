    "subsection_content": "Inflammatory and edematous reactions due to viral or bacterial infections, allergies or the body's immune response against fungi lead to multifocal degeneration of the nasal and sinus mucosa. If this condition persists for a long time, it will lead to the formation of nasal polyps.\nSpecifically, nasal polyps are often caused by the following factors: (1)\n1. Chronic or recurrent sinusitis\nProlonged inflammation of the sinus mucosa that is not treated actively will form lesions in the sinuses. Nasal polyps are one such lesion.\n2. Asthma\nAllergic respiratory tract inflammation is often accompanied by nasal polyps. The association between asthma and nasal polyps is recorded at 7-20%.\n3. Allergic rhinosinusitis\nThis is one of the leading causes of nasal polyps and nasal polyp recurrence.\n4. Cystic fibrosis\nA genetic disorder caused by the abnormal production and secretion of fluid from the nasal membranes and sinuses.\n5. Churg – Strauss syndrome\nThis is a rare disease that causes inflammation of the blood vessels and the formation of nasal polyps.\n6. Sensitivity to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nThis is an allergic reaction to anti-inflammatory drugs. The most common are ibuprofen or aspirin which can lead to the formation of nasal polyps.\n7. Genetics\nGenes that cause the nasal mucosa to respond to inflammatory agents have been recognized as genetic agents for nasal polyps.",
