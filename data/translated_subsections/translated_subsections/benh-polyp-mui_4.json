    "subsection_content": "Because the disease has symptoms similar to sinusitis or the flu, it is difficult to recognize. However, flu symptoms usually go away after 1-2 weeks while polyp symptoms often last. At this time, patients need to be examined immediately at medical facilities to receive timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment.(3)\nTo diagnose nasal polyps, a thorough medical history, clinical examination, nasal endoscopy, imaging and additional testing for allergy, bacteriology, and pulmonary function tests are required; aspirin sensitivity,...\nThrough conventional rhinoscopy, polyps can be seen. However, if nasal polyps are located deep in the sinuses, a nasal endoscopy will be performed.\nThere are 4 levels of nasal polyps determined by size, and the condition progresses through different stages:\nLevel 1: The polyp is small, soft, and fits in the gap between the nose. Polyps at this time can only be detected through endoscopy.; Level 1: The polyp is small, soft, and fits in the gap between the nose. Polyps can only be detected through endoscopy.\nLevel 2: The polyp is moderate in size, has occupied the entire space between the nose and reached the middle turbinate.; Level 2: The polyp is moderate in size, has occupied the entire space between the nose and reached the middle turbinate.\nLevel 3: The size of the polyp is large, reaching the back of the lower nasal turbinate, causing suffocation and olfactory disorders. When you lift your nose with your hand and look in the mirror, you can see polyps.; Level 3: The size of the polyp is large, reaching the back of the lower nasal turbinate, causing suffocation and olfactory disorders. When you lift your nose with your hand and look in the mirror, you can see polyps.\nLevel 4: Nasal polyps bulge very large, filling most of the nasal cavity and protruding to the nostril opening.; Level 4: Nasal polyps bulge very large, filling most of the nasal cavity and protruding to the nostril opening.\n1. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance of the sinuses\nWhen large or diffuse polyps are detected on both sides, the patient may need imaging to determine the severity of the disease and assist in planning treatment. Sinus endoscopy and imaging not only help diagnose nasal polyps and differentiate them from other tumor-like lesions in the sinus area.\n2. Allergy test to find the cause of persistent rhinitis\nFor nasal polyps in young children, tests for genetic diseases need to be performed. For example, testing for cystic fibrosis.",
