Medical treatment\nCorticosteroid nasal spray: In case of one or more small nasal polyps, drugs can be used to reduce the inflammatory response, increase air circulation through the nose and shrink the size of the polyps. Commonly used drugs are nasal sprays containing corticosteroids such as: Fluticasone, Triamcinolone, Budesonide, Flunisolide, Mometasone.; Corticosteroid nasal spray: In case of one or more small nasal polyps, drugs can be used to reduce the inflammatory response, increase air circulation through the nose and shrink the size of the polyps. Commonly used medications are nasal sprays containing corticosteroids such as: Fluticasone, Triamcinolone, Budesonide, Flunisolide, Mometasone.\nMedications to fight allergies and infections: Use antihistamines to fight allergies. Although they cannot remove polyps, these medications can help reduce nasal congestion and bring comfort to the patient. In addition, if there is a sinus infection, additional antibiotics are needed; Medications to fight allergies and infections: Use antihistamines to fight allergies.

Surgical treatment\nWhen treatment with medications does not respond, surgery to remove nasal polyps will be the next method. Depending on the location, size and number of polyps, the doctor can prescribe the appropriate type of surgery.(2)\nTypes of nasal polyp surgery include:\nNasal polyp removal surgery: Small and solitary polyps will be easily removed with a suction cutter (also known as a microdebrider). After surgery, patients need to continue treating inflammation with antibiotics and oral corticosteroids; Nasal polyp removal surgery: Small and solitary polyps will be easily removed with a suction cutter (also known as a microdebrider). After surgery, patients need to continue treating inflammation with antibiotics and oral corticosteroids.\nEndoscopic sinus surgery: A more complex surgical method that not only removes polyps but also widens the blocked sinus openings.; Endoscopic sinus surgery: A more complex surgical method that not only removes polyps but also expands blocked sinus openings.\nAfter surgery, reducing inflammation with nasal sprays, anti-allergy medications and rinsing the nose with saline can prevent polyps from recurring.\nFor patients with systemic diseases with nasal polyps such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or cystic fibrosis, the underlying disease should be treated.\nModern endoscopic sinus surgery at Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City",
