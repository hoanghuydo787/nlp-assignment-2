The virus is transmitted through the respiratory tract, eating and drinking, and droplets when the patient coughs, sneezes, and communicates.\nThere are some questions about whether the virus can be transmitted through feces and urine, when it has been found that the mumps virus can survive in a patient's urine for 2-3 weeks.\nMumps virus develops highly in serum about 12-15 days after infection and spreads to other organs. The infectious period is from 6 days before the full onset of parotid gland swelling until 2 weeks after the onset of pathological symptoms.",
