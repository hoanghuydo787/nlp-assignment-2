    "subsection_content": "Although mumps is a benign disease, it has many serious health complications. In particular, there is no specific treatment for the disease, so disease prevention is considered the most optimal option to protect health.\nPeople need to be raised aware of prevention as well as know the harmful effects of the disease, especially complications affecting reproductive health. Enhance the importance of vaccines, personal and environmental hygiene measures, and recognize signs of disease to report to health authorities for early detection and avoidance of outbreaks.\nThe most effective proactive preventive measure against mumps is vaccination. Mumps vaccine can be used as early as 12 months old. Currently in Vietnam, the most commonly used combination vaccine is measles - mumps - rubella. The vaccines are researched to be safe and highly effective, with protection reaching over 95% and long-lasting immunity. (4)\nBesides, to prevent mumps, you need to pay attention to some measures such as:\nExpanded propaganda on raising awareness of living environment hygiene, cleaning housing areas, kindergartens, schools, dormitory areas, densely populated areas... with the criteria of open ventilation in the environment Schools, living and working areas need lots of light, cleanliness and limited dust;; Have a habit of washing regularly with soap;; Housing areas, companies, schools... are clean, focusing on clean personal hygiene, preventing infectious diseases;; When an infected person needs to be isolated and treated at home or a medical facility as prescribed by a doctor to avoid infecting people around, and disinfect the area where the infected person is;; When you suspect you have the disease, you should immediately go to the nearest medical facility for examination and treatment. Especially in cases of suspected complications, do not hesitate and go immediately to the hospital for timely treatment.\nAccording to doctor Trieu Vy, \"When you have mumps, the virus can spread to other organs in the body, especially the testicles, causing damage to spermatogenic cells. This leads to edema and fibrosis of the seminiferous tubules and ultimately atrophic orchitis. When damage and fibrosis of the seminiferous tubules persist, the consequences can cause infertility in men due to reduced sperm production. Therefore, natural pregnancy becomes very difficult because the amount of sperm in the ejaculated semen is decreasing in quality and quantity since the complications of orchitis, and eventually the consequences can lead to no sperm.”\nHowever, depending on the medical case, after examination, doctors may consider using surgical intervention to extract sperm from the epididymis or testicles to remove the remaining small amount of sperm, enough to do IVF. At IVF Tam Anh, there are many cases of men with testicular atrophy and azoospermia who have been prescribed sperm donation and still have hope of having a child. Therefore, if you are unlucky enough to experience complications after having mumps, you should visit an andrologist or fertility specialist early to be examined, assessed for remaining reproductive function and given specific advice. more specifically, as well as discuss the optimal treatment method for your case.\nReproductive Support Center, Tam Anh General Hospital is mastering effective male infertility treatment techniques for patients with weak sperm, deformed sperm, azoospermia, preserving fertility for men who require treatment. cancer treatment.
