    "subsection_content": "The disease is caused by the rubella virus (not the measles virus), first isolated in 1962. It is also an infectious disease but not more severe than measles or chickenpox.\nPregnant women with Rubella can also transmit it to the fetus. Rubella virus, after infecting the mother's blood, will also be transmitted to the baby through the placenta. In addition, crowded areas such as schools, hospitals, supermarkets, factories, etc. are also environments where the disease can easily spread.\nPeople with German measles are contagious for about a week before the rash appears and can continue to be contagious for about 7 days afterward. However, about 25% to 50% of people infected with rubella do not develop a rash or have symptoms, but they can still spread it to others.\nChildren with congenital rubella syndrome can shed the virus through urine or nasopharyngeal secretions for a year or more and can spread the virus to people who are not immune. Usually transmitted through the air from nasopharyngeal secretions. The virus can also pass through the mother's blood and infect the fetus, causing fetal infection. Because it is generally a mild disease in children, the main danger of rubella is in pregnant women, where it can cause congenital rubella syndrome in the child.\nAfter entering the body, Rubella virus multiplies in respiratory cells, spreads to lymphocytes and then into the bloodstream and causes disease.",
