(2)\nIf women are infected with the Rubella virus during early pregnancy, there is a 90% chance that they will transmit the virus to the fetus. This may be the cause of stillbirth or congenital Rubella syndrome. Infants with this syndrome may shed the virus for a year or longer.\nCongenital Rubella Syndrome: Children with congenital Rubella syndrome may have hearing loss, eye defects, heart defects and other lifelong disabilities, including: autism, diabetes and thyroid dysfunction . Many cases require treatment, surgery and care at high costs.\nThe risk of congenital rubella syndrome is highest in countries where women of childbearing age do not have immunity to the disease (through vaccination or through previous exposure to German measles). Before vaccines, up to 4 out of every 1,000 babies were born with congenital Rubella syndrome.\nStatistics also show that the earlier a woman gets Rubella during pregnancy, the higher the risk of transmitting the disease to the fetus. Accordingly:\nIf pregnant women get the disease in the first month of pregnancy, the infection rate for the fetus is 81% - 90%.; If pregnant women get the disease in the second month of pregnancy, the infection rate for the fetus is 60% - 70%.; If a pregnant woman gets the disease in the 3rd month of pregnancy, the infection rate for the fetus is 35% - 50%; If pregnant women are infected when they are 13 - 16 weeks pregnant, the infection rate for the fetus is 17%; If pregnant women are infected when they are 17 - 20 weeks pregnant, the infection rate for the fetus is 5%.",
