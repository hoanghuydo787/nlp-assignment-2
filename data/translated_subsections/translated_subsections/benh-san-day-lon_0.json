Many countries in the world such as Latin America, Asia, and Africa have high disease rates due to poor eating habits and lip hygiene conditions. In Vietnam, pork tapeworm is also a common disease and occurs often in mountainous areas. (first)\nPhysical characteristics\nAdult flukes\nAdult fluke has a size of 2 - 4m (can be up to 8m long), about 300 - 1,000 segments including: head, neck and segment. The head is small, spherical, about 1mm in size, with 4 round suction discs at the 4 corners.\nOn the head there is a mace with two rows of hooks with a number of 25-30 hooks. The young fluke is located near the neck, wider in width than in length. Mature segments are as wide as they are long and contain male and female reproductive organs. Old segments are one and a half times longer than they are wide. Old segments contain 30,000 - 50,000 eggs. Each segment of the fluke has equally alternating genital openings on the side.\nEgg\nPork tapeworm eggs are spherical, have a thick shell, have larvae inside, about 35 mcm in diameter, containing embryos with 3-6 pairs of hooks. Old segments contain 30,000 - 50,000 eggs. The outer layer of the egg shell is thin, and when it comes out it will break immediately, however the protective shell right next to the larvae is thicker, with horizontal notches around it, almost like a spoke shape.\nPork tapeworm larvae\nPork tapeworm larvae, also known as cysticercosis (Cysticercus cellulosae), are opaque white in color, 10 x 8mm in size (inside contain fluid and tapeworm larval heads, so people call it pork rice. The tapeworm larval head has 4 The suction cup and 2 hooked rings resemble the head of an adult tapeworm. Depending on the location, the pork tapeworm cyst has a different shape: in the muscle it is oval like a grain of rice, and in the subcutaneous tissue it is like a bean. The real brain is spherical in shape...\nBiological characteristics\nThanks to the suction discs and hooks, flukes stick to the intestinal mucosa in the upper jejunum (small intestine), which is an environment where nutrients are available to help them easily absorb and grow quickly in a short time. Among them, nutrients such as carbohydrates are very important for fluke development.\nHumans are the main host\nAdult pork tapeworms are often parasitic in the upper small intestine of pigs. An adult pork tapeworm has many segments including the head, neck and segments. Every day, 4-5 segments of the old tapeworm fall off and rupture in the large intestine, releasing eggs. Eggs will be passed out in the stool, and sometimes the tapeworm will automatically pass through the anus to come out. However, for this cycle to develop and complete its life cycle, the pork tapeworm will find a host to parasitize.\nIn places where pig manure is not handled well, tapeworm eggs spread on grass, soil or objects. If humans accidentally swallow the eggs or burn the tapeworm, it will trigger the tapeworm's development cycle. At this time, humans are called the primary host - the host in which the pork tapeworm lives in its adult stage.\nPork tapeworms usually only parasitize one person per human body. The reason is that as soon as the first fluke parasitizes the human body, it has the ability to create immunity to fight the development of the second fluke. However, superinfection can occur when the host eats a piece of meat containing multiple types of larvae at the same time. In humans, adult tapeworms can live for 20-25 years and can live with other types of tapeworms such as beef tapeworms, dog tapeworms...\nHumans are secondary hosts\nSecondary host (also called intermediate host) – is where the pork tapeworm exists as immature larvae. In the case of humans being secondary hosts of pork tapeworms due to ingestion of pork tapeworm eggs from unwashed foods, raw fruits and vegetables. Under the influence of digestive fluids from the intestinal tract, tapeworm larvae escape from the cyst, pass through the intestinal wall, then continue to move throughout the body and \"stop\" in an organ in the body. In this case, the larvae do not develop into adult flukes but form cysticercus cellulosae in humans.\nHumans are both the primary host and secondary host\nA patient with adult pork tapeworm parasitic in the small intestine should be considered the primary host. At the same time, this person has pork tapeworm larvae in other tissues, so it is also considered a secondary host. In these cases, the disease is often severe and potentially dangerous.",
