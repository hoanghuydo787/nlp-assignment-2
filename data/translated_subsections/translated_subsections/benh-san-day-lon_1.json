People with adult tapeworms often have no clear symptoms. Depending on the body's response, some patients feel poor nutritional absorption, bloating, indigestion, nausea, epigastric pain, and loose stools. periods, loss of appetite, loss of appetite, or conversely, sometimes extreme hunger, overeating, and weight loss. When the fluke begins to shed its old segments in the feces, the clinical manifestations will decrease.\n2. Disease caused by cysticercosis\nCysticercus cysts can appear anywhere in the host's body. Depending on the number of cysts and the location of the cysts, the host will have different severe clinical manifestations, some severe cases can cause death. Larval cysts are often parasitic in subcutaneous tissue, muscles, heart, liver, lungs, brain, eyes and cavities in the abdominal area...\nHowever, most of the body will have a self-protection mechanism and eliminate tapeworm larvae, only a few cause clinical symptoms. Usually, pork tapeworm disease has mild symptoms, so few people pay attention, however, there are some cases where the disease is detected thanks to a fecal test showing tapeworm segments.\nIn some cases, hosts with parasitic larval cysts often show clear signs of pork tapeworm infection such as: nausea, intermittent headaches, diarrhea, and weight loss. Sometimes there is cramping pain in the abdomen, pain spreads to the appendix due to the tapeworm moving from the small intestine to the large intestine. Symptoms such as seizures, mood changes, and heart arrhythmia may appear in people with neurasthenia or in children.\n3. Cutaneous Larva migrans (Cutaneous Larva migrans)\nSome cases of infection with parasitic pork tapeworm larvae on the skin will cause itching, rashes, forming spots under the skin that are palpable and mobile.\n4. Ectopic larvae in muscle tissue\nLarval cysts in muscle tissue rarely occur. However, if the patient is infected with many cysts and parasites on the muscle, it can cause muscle pain.\n5. Misplaced larvae in the brain\nParasitic cysticercosis in the brain is a very dangerous case, causing many clinical symptoms. Depending on the location and number of larval cysts in the brain, the patient will have symptoms such as cysts in the brain. Possible symptoms include:\nIntermittent headache; Increased intracranial pressure; Epileptic; Memory decline; Psychosis; Eosinophils in the cerebrospinal fluid increase, which can lead to death or severe complications; Sudden death or paralysis due to nerve compression.\n6. Stray larvae in the eye\nPatients with tapeworm larvae in their eyes will have opaque white spots in the eye sockets and eyelids. If it appears in the conjunctiva, intraocular pressure, lens. Patients with parasitic tapeworms may show signs of visual disturbances, more severe cases can cause decreased vision, glaucoma, cataracts, causing blindness...\n7.
