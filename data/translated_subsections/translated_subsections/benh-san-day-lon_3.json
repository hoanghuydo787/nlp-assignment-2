    "subsection_content": "Testing for pork tapeworm eggs directly from stool (Graham method): This is a quick testing technique that does not require many complicated tools and chemicals. The method is similar to testing for pinworms by placing a piece of clear tape on the anus, then removing it and sticking it on a microscope slide to look for tapeworm eggs. The sensitivity of direct stool testing is in the range of 30% - 50%. It is necessary to test on at least 3 stool samples for 3 consecutive days to detect fluke segments or eggs.; Blood test: If infected, blood indicators may show a slight increase in eosinophils from 11% -12%, this ratio gradually returns to normal when the flukes begin to mature.; X-ray: X-ray imaging techniques can detect oval calcifications or flat images of pork flukes. If the patient has pork tapeworm, the calcifications will often appear in large numbers and lie vertically with the muscle fibers.\nBrain computed tomography (brain CT): In the case of parasitic worms in the brain and causing serious symptoms, doctors will conduct a brain CT to look for specific cross-sectional images. In case the patient has parasitic tapeworms, the cut layers will clearly show cysticerci, which are nodules with blurred spots on the slices from the images, 3-10mm in size or scattered with calcified nodules.; Serological diagnosis (ELISA): Diagnosis helps detect antibodies and antigens of pork tapeworm larvae from the patient's blood.; Biopsy: Biopsy is used when the patient shows signs of parasitic tapeworms under the skin or in the muscle. In case of suspected tapeworms under the skin or muscle, doctors will take a sample from the suspected site of tapeworm eggs or parasitic cysts to perform a biopsy.; Ophthalmoscopy: In case the patient has symptoms of eye pain, pain behind the eyeball, glaucoma or unexplained vision loss, when coming to the hospital, doctors will conduct an examination and ophthalmoscopy to determine the disease. .",
