In humans, parasitic tapeworms come in the form of adult and larval tapeworms. Depending on the type of intermediate host (cow, pig, fish...), the tapeworms that parasitize and cause disease in humans will have different names: pork tapeworm, beef tapeworm, fish tapeworm... (2)\n1. Pork tapeworm\nAdult fluke: length from 2-4m, with about 800-1,000 segments including head, neck and segment; Egg: spherical, thick shell about 35mcm in diameter, containing 6 hook embryos inside; Larval cyst (Cysticercus cellulosae): opaque white, 10x8mm in size, containing fluid and tapeworm larvae. The head of the tapeworm larva has 4 suction plates and 2 rows of hooks, very similar to the head of the adult tapeworm.\n2. Beef tapeworm\nAdult fluke: 4-10m long, pear-shaped head 1-2mm in diameter, has 4 suction discs, no thread or hook. The old segment is 2.5-3 times longer than the width. The fluke segment automatically crawls out and can be found in blankets, mats, clothes.; Eggs: 30-40cm in size, similar to pork tapeworm eggs; Larval cyst (Cysticercus bovis): smaller than pork tapeworm larval cyst, 6-8mm x 3-5mm in size, red in color because it contains myoglobin, with larval head inside.\n3. Fish tapeworm\nAdult fluke: is the largest parasitic fluke in humans, ivory white or yellow-gray, 10-12m long, sometimes 20m, consisting of 3,000-4,000 segments. The tip of the fluke is small, oval-shaped, measuring 2.3mm x 0.7mm, without a suction disc but with 2 suction grooves. Mature segments are trapezoidal in shape, length shorter than width, size 10-12mm x 3-4mm.; Eggs: brown, thin shell with lid, more like trematode eggs but smaller in size, 70 x 45mcm (1mm = 1,000 mcm), not embryonic at birth.\nA parasitic parasite in freshwater fish is being analyzed in the laboratory",
