    "subsection_content": "Anyone can become infected after eating tapeworm eggs or larvae. Accordingly, common infectious causes include:\nEating tapeworm eggs\nTapeworm eggs enter humans through three main routes: food, water, and contaminated soil.\nIf the host (pig, cow, etc.) has a tapeworm, segments or eggs of the tapeworm may be present in the host's feces and fall to the ground. Each segment can contain thousands of eggs.\nA person can become infected with tapeworms from:\nDrinking contaminated water; Dirty hands when coming into contact with animals and contaminated soil; Consuming contaminated food, especially fruits and vegetables that are fertilized with fresh manure and have not gone through any processing steps.\nThe eggs hatch into larvae, enter the intestines, and then move and infect other parts of the body. This type of infection is most common with tapeworms from pigs.\nEating infected meat or fish\nIf meat or fish carries larval cysts and is not cooked or raw, these cysts can travel to the intestines and develop into adult tapeworms.\nAn adult tapeworm may have the following characteristics:\nLive up to 20 years; Up to 15m long; Attaches itself to the intestinal wall; Passes through the human digestive system and is excreted in feces\nFish tapeworm infection is more common in countries that commonly consume raw fish, such as Eastern Europe, Scandinavian countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden...) and Japan. Undercooked or raw freshwater fish, such as salmon, are the most common sources of infection.\nTransmitted from person to person\nDwarf tapeworms can be transmitted from person to person. This is also the only tapeworm that can spend its entire life cycle in a single host. Dwarf tapeworm infection is the most common tapeworm infection globally.\nTransmitted from insects to humans\nFleas and some other bugs can acquire tapeworm eggs by eating the feces of infected rats or mice. These insects can infect humans as intermediate hosts, and the tapeworms move from egg to adult stage. This type of infection occurs with dwarf tapeworms and is much more common in places where poor hygiene is practiced.\nRe-infection with tapeworms\nDuring treatment, people can reinfect themselves if good hygiene practices are not followed. Eggs are in human feces, not washing hands after going to the toilet will increase the risk of reinfection.\nNot paying attention to risk factors for tapeworm infection\nRisk factors include:\nWorking or contact with animals: Often occurs in places where feces are not effectively disposed of. Raising pigs freely and slaughtering pigs is not good; Poor hygiene: If you do not wash your hands regularly, the risk of oral infection is higher.; Traveling or living in places with poor hygiene practices increases the risk of tapeworm infection.; Consuming raw or undercooked meat and fish: Larvae and eggs found in meat and fish can infect humans if eaten raw or undercooked. The risk of pollution from fish mainly belongs to the freshwater fish group.",
