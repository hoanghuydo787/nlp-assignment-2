    "subsection_content": "The risk of complications depends on a number of factors, including the type of tapeworm and whether the patient receives treatment:\nTapeworm disease: If people eat pork tapeworm eggs, they will be at risk of being infected with larvae. Larvae can escape from the intestines and infect other tissues and organs in the body, which can cause organ damage and, in severe cases, death.; Neurocysticercosis: This is a dangerous complication of pork tapeworm infection. The brain and nervous system are affected. Sufferers may experience symptoms of headaches, vision problems, seizures, meningitis and confusion. In very severe cases, the infection can be fatal.; Echinococcosis or hydatid disease: Echinococcus tapeworms can cause an infection called echinococcosis. The larvae leave the intestines and infect organs, most commonly the liver. Infection can lead to large cysts, which put pressure on nearby blood vessels and affect circulation. In case of severe damage, surgery or liver transplant is required.\nHydatid cyst of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus in the liver",
