Use vegetables that grow underwater such as celery, watercress, watercress, etc., with uncooked water containing tapeworm larvae.

From the abdominal cavity, the fluke penetrates the liver capsule to enter the liver, causing damage to the liver parenchyma.\nIn addition, the preference for eating raw foods from pork, beef, fish, shrimp... raw sushi, sashimi or unhygienic lifestyle, open defecation, throwing untreated waste into the environment... are also Causes of tapeworms to multiply, invade the body and cause harm to humans.",
