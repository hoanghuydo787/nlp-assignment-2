    "subsection_content": "The process of developing liver fluke disease is divided into two stages:\n1. Infiltration and incubation stage\nThis stage is calculated from day 4 to day 7 after exposure to the parasite. Depending on the number of invading larvae and the host's response, infected people have different symptoms or have no symptoms. For small liver flukes, people infected with more than 100 flukes will have symptoms. For liver flukes, it is necessary to base on the number of larvae ingested and the host's response, so the incubation period is more difficult to determine (several days, weeks or longer).\n2. Biliary invasion stage\nAfter entering the body, the fluke will go to the stomach and duodenum and then follow the bile duct into the liver. Here, the flukes develop into adult liver flukes, live and migrate to the bile and cause disease as they excrete metabolic waste through the liver and bile. This can be considered the cause of bile duct blockage and bile duct inflammation. This phase can last for several months.",
