Snails are the host and continue to go through the next stages of development. Snails lay eggs on plants and are eaten by herbivores and then transmitted to humans through food (uncooked meat of infected animals).\nIn addition, humans can also directly introduce parasites into the body when eating raw vegetables contaminated with tapeworm larvae that have not been washed or cooked. After entering the human body, live liver flukes develop into adult flukes.",
