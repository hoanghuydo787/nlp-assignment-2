    "subsection_content": "In addition to finding out information and physical manifestations of the patient, diagnosing liver fluke disease also relies on testing techniques. These tests apply to cases of people infected with liver flukes who do not have clear symptoms or symptoms similar to other disease conditions. Accordingly, testing methods used to detect liver fluke disease in particular and parasites in general include:\nThere are many methods of diagnosing liver fluke disease, and people with the disease need to be treated thoroughly to avoid dangerous health complications.\n1. Blood biochemical test\nAlso known as serological diagnostic test for parasites. Your doctor can identify liver fluke antibodies, which are proteins produced by the body to help fight any infection, also known as the IgG and IgE antibody duo.\nIf the body is infected with liver flukes, the amount of IgG and IgE always increases. IgE levels can increase up to 48% in people infected with liver flukes. In some other cases, the doctor may also check the white blood cell count. An increase in white blood cells can mean the body is trying to fight an infection.\n2. Duodenal aspirate, fecal egg test\nThis technique is to look for the appearance of fluke eggs in duodenal fluid and stool to determine the type of trematode the patient has. However, this technique does not produce good results.\n3. ELISA technical test\nELISA test, also known as enzyme-linked immunosorbent test, is a paraclinical test to determine the concentration of IgG and IgE antibodies, secreted when the body is infected with liver flukes. Accordingly, if the concentration exceeds the allowable threshold, the patient is positive for liver fluke.\nELISA immunoassay has the advantages of being simple, fast and accurately identifying diseases.\n4. Review liver imaging\nLiver images can help doctors determine whether or not damage to the liver or bile ducts is caused by liver flukes. Images are obtained from diagnostic imaging techniques such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP for short, used to investigate and treat problems with the bile duct, pancreatic duct and gallbladder), cholangiography, computed tomography (CT), ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In some cases, the doctor may choose to perform a stomach endoscopy to diagnose liver fluke infection.",
