    "subsection_content": "Retinal vein occlusion is a condition in which blood flow from the retina is blocked by a blood clot. Arteries carry blood from the heart to all parts of the body, and veins carry blood back to the heart. A blockage in an artery or vein is called an embolism or stroke.\nThe retina is covered with special nerve cells that convert light into signals and transmit them to the brain to help us see images. When the retina is damaged, it will directly affect the patient's ability to see. (first)\nCovid-19 increases the risk of many diseases, including eye diseases\nNerve cells need a constant supply of blood to provide oxygen and nutrients, and blood vessels do this important job. When a blockage occurs, a blood clot blocks the flow of blood through one of the brain's arteries, causing damage to the area that does not receive blood.\nThis damage can also occur in any part of the body. When a retinal vein is blocked, blood cannot flow out of the retina, leading to hemorrhage (bleeding) from the blocked blood vessels and fluid leakage from the blood vessels.",
