    "subsection_content": "Retinal vein occlusion is divided into 2 types:\nCentral retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is a major vein occlusion, often appearing suddenly in one eye. Depending on the level and location of the blockage, disease symptoms range from mild to severe, even without symptoms. There are cases where only a black spot appears in the eye, without affecting vision. Groups susceptible to the disease are often people with narrowed or damaged blood vessels or are suffering from chronic diseases such as glaucoma, macular edema, atherosclerosis, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol...\nBranch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) is an obstruction of one of the smaller branch veins, caused by the appearance of a thrombus in the vein. This is also the reason for about 30% of cases. Venous occlusion occurs, causing blockage of blood drainage in the macular area, causing macular edema and reduced vision.",
