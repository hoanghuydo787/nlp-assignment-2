Central retinal vein occlusion usually occurs in people 50 years of age and older. In most cases, the cause of the disease is unknown. (2)\nPeople with existing eye problems are at high risk of retinal vein occlusion\nRetinal vein occlusion occurs when a blood clot blocks the vessel and causes an obstruction. Sometimes venous occlusion occurs because the eye's veins are too narrow. In addition, groups of people at higher risk than others include:\nPeople with diabetes; People with arteriosclerosis; People with high blood pressure; People with glaucoma; People with high cholesterol levels; Blood disorders that affect blood clotting or other health problems that affect blood flow; Smoker; People over 60 years old\nThe disease usually occurs in one eye, however, about 6%-17% of cases have this disease in the second eye.",
