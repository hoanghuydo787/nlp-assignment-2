Pham Huy Vu Tung - Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, shared.\nBlurring or loss of vision may be mild at first, but may get worse over the next few hours or days. Sometimes complete vision loss occurs almost immediately.\nIf these symptoms occur, it is important that the patient see an eye specialist as soon as possible. Retinal vein occlusion often causes permanent damage to the retina, even complete loss of vision. This is also the cause of other eye problems.",
