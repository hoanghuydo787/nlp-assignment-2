    "subsection_content": "Complications of retinal vein occlusion not only directly affect vision but also cause other eye problems, including:\nMacular edema: The macula is a small central area of ​​the retina that helps you have detailed, sharp vision, necessary for viewing and reading activities... When blood and fluid leak into the macula, it will cause edema and blurred vision. and/or loss of vision, called macular edema; Neovascularization: Retinal vein occlusion can stimulate the retina to grow new, abnormal blood vessels, often called neovascularization. These new vessels may leak blood or fluid into the vitreous cavity. As a result, small dark spots or dark clouds may appear in your vision. Severe complications of neovascularization can cause the retina to separate from the back of the eye.; Neovascular Glaucoma: New blood vessels in some parts of the eye can cause pain and increase pressure inside the eye. When glaucoma persists, it is likely to cause glaucoma and impaired vision.; Blindness: Complications of retinal vein occlusion, if left untreated, can lead to irreversible loss of vision.",
