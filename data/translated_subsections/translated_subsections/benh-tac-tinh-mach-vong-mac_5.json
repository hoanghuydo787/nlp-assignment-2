Before that, the patient will be given drops to dilate the pupils to make the eye examination process easier.

These images help the doctor determine whether or not swelling and edema are present in the retina. Your doctor will use OCT images to document the progression of the disease throughout treatment.; Ophthalmoscopy: Through the ophthalmoscope, the doctor will examine the retina to detect changes caused by retinal vein occlusion; Fluorescein angiography: This is a test in which dye is injected into a vein in the arm and travels to the retinal blood vessels. The results produce special images that help doctors easily observe blood vessels.",
