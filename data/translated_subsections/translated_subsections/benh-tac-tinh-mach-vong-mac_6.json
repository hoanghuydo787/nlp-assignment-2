About 1/3 of patients show some improvement, 1/3 stay the same and about 1/3 gradually improve, but it can take about a year to see these results. In some cases, blocked vessels lead to fluid buildup in the retina. In other cases, the disease can cause the formation of new blood vessels. (4)\nAccordingly, some treatment methods include:\nInjection of anti-angiogenic drugs (VEGF), also known as anti-angiogenic drugs, aims to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor, preventing the formation of new blood vessels.; Corticosteroid injections: Group of drugs that fight inflammatory components that lead to edema; Focal laser therapy: Laser beams are directed to swollen areas to reduce edema.; Retinal laser photocoagulation therapy: This treatment method is applied when patients have new blood vessel formation after retinal vein occlusion. This therapy helps destroy retinal neovascularization, prevent vitreoretinal hemorrhage and macular edema, prevent progression and preserve the patient's vision.",
