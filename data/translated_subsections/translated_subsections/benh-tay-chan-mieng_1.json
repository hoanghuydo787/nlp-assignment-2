    "subsection_content": "Hand, foot and mouth disease is an infectious disease that often occurs due to the invasion of Coxsackie virus A16 or enterovirus 71 (EV71) - of which EV71 is less common but causes more serious complications. These are strains of virus that live in the digestive tract and are transmitted from person to person through direct contact with saliva, fluid from blisters, vomit, and droplets when coughing or sneezing of the sick person.\nIn particular, research shows that the virus that causes hand, foot and mouth disease can only be destroyed at a temperature of 60 degrees for 15 minutes. In cold temperatures of - 40 degrees Celsius, the virus will survive up to 3 weeks in the outside environment. Therefore, children can become infected by contact with food, drinks, table tops, shared toys, chairs, etc. contain disease-causing viruses. (2)\nIn addition, the disease can be caused by some other group A virus strains such as Coxsackie A4-A7, A9, A10 or group B Coxsackie virus (B1-B3, and B5). Therefore, children who have had hand, foot and mouth disease can still be reinfected many times.",
