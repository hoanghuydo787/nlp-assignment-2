Currently, there is no specific treatment for hand, foot and mouth disease. Therefore, proper care of children will help the treatment process achieve the best results and minimize the risk of dangerous complications.\nIn the process of caring for children with hand, foot and mouth disease, there are 4 factors that parents need to pay special attention to:\n1. Implement quarantine for children\nHand, foot and mouth disease is a very contagious disease in crowded places such as kindergartens, schools, and public places.

Children should not be sent to school for a period of 10 - 14 days from the date of illness. Parents also need to clearly inform the cause of their child's health condition so that schools can take timely measures to monitor and supervise. time.\nAdults taking care of children also need to use masks and wash their hands regularly to avoid infecting those around them.\n2. Pay attention to nutrition\nAnorexia and anorexia are common conditions in children with hand, foot and mouth disease due to ulcers in the mouth causing pain and discomfort for children. Therefore, parents should prepare soft foods for children that are easy to swallow and digest so that children can eat more. Children should be fed several times a day and pay attention to the nutritional ingredients in the dishes to fully supplement the child's essential nutrients.\nAvoid letting your baby suck on plastic nipples that are too hard, or feed them with utensils with sharp edges. Avoid foods that are too hot or spicy because they can make your child's mouth and throat even more sore.\nAdd appropriate amounts of water, because children are at risk of dehydration due to fever and loss of appetite. Absolutely do not abstain harshly, you should let the child eat normally as soon as the child shows signs of improvement.\n3. Maintain hygiene\nMaintaining careful hygiene for children and caregivers will limit the spread of hand, foot and mouth disease on a large scale and help the treatment process achieve faster results.\nChildren need to be kept clean and do not need to limit bathing when they have hand, foot and mouth disease. However, children should bathe in a well-ventilated room with antibacterial soap.; Items used for children such as milk bottles, eating utensils, household utensils, and toys need to be used separately or cleaned regularly to disinfect.; Clothes and diapers need to be changed regularly and soaked with specialized antiseptic solutions.; Hand, foot and mouth disease is most contagious in the first week, but the virus can persist in stool for several months afterward. Therefore, waste and feces should be disposed of in the right and safe place.\n4. Use medicine properly\nDo not arbitrarily give children medications without a doctor's advice. A very common mistake parents make when taking care of children with hand, foot and mouth disease is arbitrarily using antibiotics to treat their children. While the cause of hand, foot and mouth disease is a virus, antibiotics do not kill viruses, they only kill bacteria. In fact, taking antibiotics is not effective in this case.\nIn case your child has a high fever, you should only use paracetamol to reduce fever or other medications as prescribed by your doctor.\n“While waiting for an effective vaccine to prevent hand, foot and mouth disease, we can proactively prevent the disease in children with very simple measures that can be done every day such as: Encouraging children to wash hands regularly with soap; Always wash your hands after taking care of children, changing diapers, after going to the toilet, after coughing or sneezing, and when preparing food; Prevent children from touching places that have not been disinfected; clean the objects children use every day... And especially avoid contact with people who are sick or have suspected signs of hand, foot and mouth disease\", Master, Doctor Le Phan Kim Thoa, Former Head of Pediatrics Department, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City said.\nFor more information about child care and other health issues, you can contact the Department of Pediatrics, Tam Anh General Hospital at:\nHand, foot and mouth disease is considered a benign disease that can be completely cured if detected early and treated promptly. If not detected early, the disease can progress badly and leave many dangerous complications. Therefore, you need to proactively prevent, examine and treat when there are signs of disease.",
