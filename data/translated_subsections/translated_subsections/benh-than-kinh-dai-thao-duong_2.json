    "subsection_content": "There are 4 types of diabetic neuropathy, each type will cause damage in a certain location and have different symptoms including: (2)\nPeripheral neuropathy: Usually affects the nerves of the feet and legs, and can occasionally affect the nerves of the hands and forearms. Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy include: Tingling, numbness, prickling sensation, tingling, foot pain, loss of feeling in the feet, slipping off sandals, etc. About ⅓ to ½ of diabetics There are peripheral nerve complications and this is the most common form of neuropathy in diabetic patients.; Autonomic neuropathy: The disease affects the autonomic nerves of the digestive system, cardiovascular system, urinary system and genital organs, sweat glands, eyes, loss of ability to recognize signs of hypoglycemia. Autonomic nerves in the digestive system can affect any part of the digestive system such as esophageal motility disorders causing difficulty swallowing, patients will have symptoms of gastroparesis such as bloating, flatulence, and overeating. indigestion, nausea, vomiting, constipation or loose stools, involuntary bowel movements. Autonomic neuropathy in the cardiovascular system will have symptoms such as: Dizziness when changing positions, tachycardia at rest, postural hypotension, etc. Damage to the autonomic nerves in the genital system will cause symptoms. Symptoms such as erectile dysfunction and retrograde ejaculation in men. In women, symptoms appear such as decreased libido, decreased lubrication, vaginal dryness, and increased pain during intercourse. Damage to autonomic nerves in the urinary system causes diabetic neuropathy, patients have symptoms such as urinary incontinence, frequent nocturia, frequent urination, urgency or urinary retention, and water flow. Weak urination. Abnormal hyperhidrosis or hypohidrosis. A dangerous complication is that the patient loses the ability to recognize the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, leading to hypoglycemic coma.; Autonomic neuropathy in the digestive system can affect any part of the digestive system such as esophageal motility disorders causing difficulty swallowing, patients will have symptoms of gastroparesis such as bloating, flatulence, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, constipation or loose stools, involuntary bowel movements; Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy will have symptoms such as: Dizziness when changing positions, tachycardia when resting, postural hypotension,...; Damage to autonomic nerves in the reproductive system will cause symptoms such as erectile dysfunction and retrograde ejaculation in men. In women, symptoms appear such as decreased libido, decreased lubrication, vaginal dryness, increased pain during intercourse.; Damage to autonomic nerves in the urinary system causes diabetic neuropathy, patients have symptoms such as urinary incontinence, frequent nocturia, frequent urination, urgency or urinary retention, and water flow. Weak urination; Abnormal hyperhidrosis or hypohidrosis; A dangerous complication is that the patient loses the ability to recognize the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, leading to hypoglycemic coma.\nMononeuropathy: Is a condition in which single nerves are damaged; nerve damage can occur in the arms, head, trunk, or legs. The most common are nerve compression injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome causing pain, numbness, hand muscle atrophy... Other forms of localized nerve damage are less common. Cranial neuropathies present acutely and are rare, mainly involving cranial nerves III, IV, VI and VII, and usually resolve spontaneously within a few months.; Plexus-radicular disease: Muscle atrophy due to diabetes or polyneuropathy often involves the lumbosacral plexus. The disease often presents with pain on one side of the thigh and weight loss, followed by weakness of movement. These disorders are often self-limiting and improve over time with treatment and physical therapy.",
