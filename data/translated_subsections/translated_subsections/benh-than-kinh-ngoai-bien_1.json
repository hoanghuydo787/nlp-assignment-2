Nerves are classified into:(3)\nSensory nerves receive sensations, such as temperature, pain, vibration or touch, from the skin.; Motor nerves control muscle movement; Mixed nerves control both movement and sensation; The autonomic/autonomic nerves control functions such as blood pressure, sweating, heart rate, digestion and bladder function.\nAccordingly, symptoms of peripheral neuropathy may include:\nFeeling of wearing “gloves” or “wearing socks”.; Burning or sharp pain; Stinging or electric shock-like pain when the skin is irritated; Difficulty sleeping due to tired and sore feet; Loss of balance and coordination; Muscle weakness; Muscle spasms/twitches; Difficulty walking or moving your arms; Abnormal sweating; Abnormalities in blood pressure or fast or slow pulse; Dry, pale green skin\nSymptoms include weakness in the limbs such as not being able to hold anything, feeling like your feet are peeling or not being able to recognize when touching the ground or wearing slippers, and feeling pain like being stabbed or burned in your hands and feet. may be common signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.\nNeurological disease, also known as neurological disorder, is a disease that affects the nerves, brain, roots, plexuses, etc. It is necessary to understand the causes, symptoms and treatment of the disease.",
