Health conditions that can cause peripheral neuropathy include:(2)\nAutoimmune diseases: Includes Sjogren's syndrome, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy, and vasculitis.; Autoimmune diseases: Includes Sjogren's syndrome, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy, and vasculitis.\nDiabetes: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy affects nearly 50% of adults with diabetes and often causes serious complications such as foot ulcers and lower limb amputations.; Diabetes: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy affects nearly 50% of adults with diabetes and often causes serious complications such as foot ulcers and lower limb amputations.\nInfections: Includes certain viral or bacterial infections such as Lyme disease, shingles, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B and C, leprosy, diphtheria, and HIV.; Infections: Includes certain viral or bacterial infections such as Lyme disease, shingles, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B and C, leprosy, diphtheria, and HIV.\nGenetic disorders: Disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are inherited neurological diseases; Genetic disorders: Disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are inherited neurological diseases.\nTumors: The growth of benign or malignant (cancerous) tumors can cause nerve compression. In addition, polyneuropathy can arise due to certain cancers related to the body's immune response. This is a type of degenerative disorder called paraneoplastic syndrome.; Tumors: The growth of benign or malignant (cancerous) tumors can cause nerve compression. In addition, polyneuropathy can arise due to certain cancers related to the body's immune response. This is a type of degenerative disorder called paraneoplastic syndrome.\nBone marrow disorders: Include an abnormal protein in the blood (monoclonal gammopathies), a form of bone cancer (myeloma), lymphoma, and the rare disease amyloidosis.; Bone marrow disorders: Include an abnormal protein in the blood (monoclonal gammopathies), a form of bone cancer (myeloma), lymphoma and the rare disease amyloidosis.\nOther diseases: Including kidney disease, liver disease, connective tissue disorders and kidney failure.; Other diseases: Includes kidney disease, liver disease, connective tissue disorders and kidney failure.\nPeripheral neuropathy can also have other causes including:\nChronic alcoholism: Chronic alcoholism can lead to peripheral neuropathy.; Chronic alcoholism: Chronic alcoholism can lead to peripheral neuropathy.\nExposure to toxins: Toxic substances including industrial chemicals and heavy metals such as lead and mercury can cause nerve damage.; Exposure to toxins: Toxic substances including industrial chemicals and heavy metals such as lead and mercury can cause nerve damage.\nTaking medications: Some medications, especially those used to treat cancer (chemotherapy) and HIV/AIDS, can cause peripheral neuropathy.; Taking medications: Some medications, especially those used to treat cancer (chemotherapy) and HIV/AIDS, can cause peripheral neuropathy.\nDamage or pressure on nerves: Injuries, such as motor vehicle accidents, falls, or sports injuries, can sever or damage peripheral nerves. Nerve pressure can also be caused by wearing a cast or using crutches or repeating a movement such as tapping over and over.; Damage or pressure on nerves: Injuries, such as motor vehicle accidents, falls, or sports injuries, can sever or damage peripheral nerves. Nerve pressure can also be caused by wearing a cast or using crutches or repeating a movement such as tapping over and over.\nVitamin deficiency: B vitamins, especially vitamins B1, B6, B12; vitamin E and niacin are important for nerve health.
