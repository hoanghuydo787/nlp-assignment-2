    "subsection_content": "Before diagnosing peripheral neuropathy, your doctor will review your medical history and conduct a physical exam to evaluate your nerves. After a neurological evaluation, depending on the symptoms and results of the neurological evaluation, the patient may have other tests that help the doctor determine the type of peripheral neuropathy including:\nNeuromuscular electromyography: Electromyography can show problems with how the body's nerve signals travel to the muscles. For this test, the doctor will place a small needle into the patient's muscle. Then, the doctor will ask the patient to gently move the muscles. The probe in the needle will measure the amount of electricity moving through the patient's muscles, from which the doctor can determine whether there is nerve damage, the extent of the damage, and the type of disease causing the damage.; Neuromuscular electromyography: Electromyography can show problems with how the body's nerve signals travel to the muscles.

Depending on the condition and cause of the disease, the doctor may prescribe additional blood tests such as: Vitamin B12 and folate content; Thyroid, liver and kidney function; Evaluation of vasculitis; Blood sugar; Antibodies to nerve C components; HIV AIDS; Hepatitis C and B, Genetics.; Blood tests: Blood tests can measure vitamin and blood sugar levels, and determine whether the patient's thyroid gland is functioning normally.
