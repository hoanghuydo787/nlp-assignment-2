    "subsection_content": "Treatment is based on treating the underlying disorder. For example, if diabetes is the cause, good blood sugar control is needed. If a vitamin deficiency is the cause, it can be treated by supplementing the missing vitamins... Many treatments can help relieve symptoms and return the person to daily activities. Sometimes, combining treatment methods can provide the best treatment results.\nPain relievers: Over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen can help control moderate pain. But if the patient takes too much, these drugs can negatively affect liver or stomach function. Therefore, patients need to use it as directed and should not use it for a long time, especially for those who often drink alcohol.; Pain relievers: Over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen can help control moderate pain.

Additionally, other prescription medications include: Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors; tramadol; corticosteroid injections; seizure medication such as gabapentin or pregabalin; antidepressants such as amitriptyline; Cymbalta (a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor); Prescription medications for sexual dysfunction in men include: sildenafil (Viagra); vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn); tadalafil (Cialis); avanafil (Stendra).; Prescription medications: Many prescription pain medications can also help control pain caused by peripheral neuropathy, such as some anti-seizure medications and some antidepressants.

This transfusion method helps remove potentially irritating antibodies from the blood. If the patient has a nerve block, the doctor will inject anesthetic directly into the nerve to treat the disease.; Plasmapheresis: This is a medical treatment to control the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.

If the patient has a nerve block, the doctor will inject anesthetic directly into the nerve to treat the disease.\nTranscutaneous electronic nerve stimulation (TENS): During TENS, electrodes placed on the skin transmit a small amount of electricity into the skin. The goal of this treatment is to interrupt the nerves that transmit pain signals to the brain.; Transcutaneous electronic nerve stimulation (TENS): During TENS, electrodes placed on the skin transmit a small amount of electricity into the skin.

Connecting, grafting and transferring nerves: in nerve plexus damage helps restore arm nerves to improve arm activities, minimal activities in daily activities; Surgical methods: In peripheral neuropathy surgery, depending on the specific case, there are methods: Decompressing surrounding organizations that cause nerve compression, thereby helping to reduce pain and improve sensation.

Both alcohol and tobacco worsen peripheral neuropathy and can cause nerve damage with long-term use. At the same time, patients need to pay attention to staying safe to avoid accidents due to loss of balance or loss of sensation caused by peripheral neuropathy such as:\nDo not go barefoot; There are no obstacles in the house; Check the temperature of the bathtub or dishwater with your elbow, not your hand or foot.; Install handrails in the bathtub or shower.; Use anti-slip bath mats.; Do not stay in one position for too long.
