    "subsection_content": "There are many causes of neurological diseases, but the most common are:\n1. Diabetes\nStatistics show that about 12 - 50% of people with diabetes have complications affecting peripheral nerves. Severe blood sugar disorders affect the functioning of nerves, specifically causing nerve conduction properties to slow down or change. Therefore, the electrical impulses to these nerves do not work as usual.\n2. Chemotherapy\nCancer patients may develop peripheral neuropathy due to chemotherapy. Symptoms can include severe pain, impaired movement, changes in heart rate and blood pressure, balance problems, difficulty breathing, paralysis and even organ failure. Up to 68% of people undergoing chemotherapy experience peripheral nervous system disorders within the first month. This rate decreased to 30% after 6 months.\n3. Age\nThe incidence of the disease is proportional to age. The older you are, the higher your risk of developing nervous system diseases. Statistics show that 8% of people aged 55 and older have some form of polyneuropathy.\n4. HIV or AIDS\nPatients being treated for HIV or AIDS can develop the disease due to the effects of the virus and the medications used to treat it. Common symptoms include burning, tingling, loss of feeling in the feet and hands...\n5. Autoimmune disorders\nPathologies related to autoimmune disorders are risk factors for neurological disorders. Among them, the most common are rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, sarcoidosis, celiac disease, Sjogren's syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n6. Injuries and bone and joint diseases\nSometimes, sports injuries can damage or put pressure on the nerves, disrupting their function and causing abnormalities in the nervous system. For example, if you have an injury to your spine, the peripheral nerves or spinal cord will be affected.\nIn addition, some diseases that occur due to work characteristics also increase the risk of neurological diseases. For example, carpal tunnel syndrome – which arises from repetitive pressure on the nerves and tendons in the hand – can cause tingling or numbness in the palm of the hand and along the fingers. This condition usually affects people between the ages of 40 and 60, and is more common in women than men.\n7. Infection\nInfectious diseases, such as shingles, can also lead to disorders of the nervous system. The risk of developing postherpetic neuralgia increases with age. Specifically, within one month after getting shingles, 27% of patients aged 55 - 59 years old and 73% of patients over 70 years old encountered this condition. Among them, women are at higher risk of getting the disease.\nWith Lyme (a disease caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi), up to 12% of patients develop neurological symptoms, especially facial-related neuropathy.\n8. Vitamin deficiencies, malnutrition and alcohol abuse\nWhen lacking nutrients, nerves may stop working or not function normally. The reasons why this condition occurs are: unbalanced diet (too much of one micronutrient but deficient in another); the body has a disease or an absorption dysfunction that prevents nutrients from being fully absorbed; alcohol abuse…\nResearch shows that vitamin B12 deficiency, common in 10-15% of people over 60 years old, is associated with neuropathy. The reason is that when there is not enough vitamin B12, the myelin sheaths that surround and protect the nerves will be seriously damaged.\n9. Toxins\nToxins found in foods (which most of us think of as healthy) can also lead to neuropathy. For example, some people eat a lot of seafood because they think it is good for their health. However, they do not know that there are types of seafood that contain a lot of mercury - a disease-causing agent.\n10. Genetics\nSome types of neurological diseases can be passed from parents to children. The disease is diagnosed through genetic testing, electromyography, and nerve or muscle biopsy.\n11. Idiopathic causes\nAmong patients, up to 23% of cases have no identifiable cause. This condition, called idiopathic peripheral neuropathy, is most common in people over 60 years of age.",
