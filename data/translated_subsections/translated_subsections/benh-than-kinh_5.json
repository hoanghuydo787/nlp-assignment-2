Maintain a healthy diet\nDiet plays a very important role in brain health.

Get enough sleep\nSleep is essential for the body in general and the brain in particular. If we don't get enough sleep, our bodies cannot recharge and our brains cannot maintain the necessary agility.\nTry to get 6 - 8 hours of sleep every night to ensure optimal brain function, prevent brain fog, lack of concentration and headaches.\n5.

Stay away from tobacco\nThere is no doubt about the harmful effects of tobacco on the health of the heart, liver, lungs...
