Patients may limit physical activity due to pain during exertion, affecting general health.\nIf left untreated for a long time, the herniated organs often protrude out and stick to the surrounding tissue, unable to return to the abdomen, called an incarcerated hernia. At this time, the patient will be more uncomfortable and at risk of injury to herniated organs.(4)\nIn some cases, patients have complications of strangulation, meaning the herniated organs cannot return into the abdominal cavity, causing edema leading to lack of blood supply, necrosis and infection. If the herniated organ is the intestine, it can cause intestinal obstruction, manifested by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, inability to smell and defecate. If surgery is not performed promptly within 4-6 hours after onset, the intestine may become necrotic, endangering the patient's life, and surgical treatment will also be more complicated, requiring section of intestine to be removed, and may not be possible. Mesh can be placed to reinforce the groin area, thereby increasing the risk of recurrence - said Dr. Thai.",
