    "subsection_content": "Chickenpox is an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. This virus is about 150-200mm in size, with a nucleus of DNA. People with the disease will develop a rash and small blisters filled with fluid, causing itching. The disease is highly contagious to people who have not been vaccinated or have never been infected with the varicella-zoster virus.\nChickenpox was described in ancient times, but medicine at that time thought it was a mild form of smallpox. It was not until 1765 that scientist Vogel named chickenpox Varicella. In 1767, English doctor William Heberden proved that smallpox was different from chickenpox. For the first time, chickenpox was described as having a distinct clinical picture. Continuing in 1875, scientist Rudolf Steiner showed that chickenpox was an infectious disease. Finally, chickenpox was isolated by scientist Thomas Weller in 1954. Japanese virologist Michiaki Takahashi was the one who directly developed the chickenpox vaccine in 1972.\nChickenpox blisters",
