    "subsection_content": "After 10 - 21 days of exposure to the varicella-zoster virus, the patient has symptoms of blisters on the skin and mucous membranes, itching due to infection, rash, and rashes that appear in several waves 3-4 days apart. Chickenpox usually lasts about 5 - 10 days. In addition, patients may also experience signs of chickenpox such as: Fever, loss of appetite, headache, fatigue and feeling of discomfort in the body. (2)\nIncubation period\nThe virus that causes chickenpox has an incubation period of 2 to 3 weeks. Depending on the resistance and the infected person, the incubation period for each person is different, on average lasting from 10 - 20 days.\nStage of illness\nAt the beginning of the illness, the patient has symptoms of fatigue, headache, muscle pain, loss of appetite, vomiting, mild fever, runny nose, and sore throat. And 1-2 days later, red itchy rashes will appear on the patient's skin, with a diameter of several millimeters, starting in the head and eyes and then spreading to the whole body. Some patients also have lymph nodes behind the ears and sore throat.\nFull-blown stage\nThe blisters, also known as a blister-like rash, appear quickly within 1 day later. The erythema turns into round blisters, with a diameter of 1-3mm, containing white or milky fluid inside. If infected with bacteria, the fluid will be accompanied by pus. The rash appears more often in areas with less pressure such as the interscapular area, the flanks, the armpits, the stilts, sometimes densely on the face and trunk, and the rash is less common on the limbs. Erythema develops many times on the same skin area, so the patient will see the rash grow at many different levels from papules, clear blisters, opaque blisters or crusts. People with chickenpox can have anywhere from a few blisters to hundreds of blisters on the body.\nOnce the chickenpox rash appears, it will be pink or red (papular). Small fluid-filled blisters (vesicles), form over about 1 day, then burst and ooze fluid. After that, the broken blisters take a few more days to heal. During that time, new blisters continue to appear. Chickenpox is usually mild in healthy children, but in some cases, the rash can cover the entire body, and lesions can form on the throat and eyes. and the lining of the urethra, anus, and vagina.\nRecovery phase\nThe disease lasts 7-10 days, and the scabs usually fall off after 1-3 weeks. If chickenpox has no complications, the blisters will gradually dry, scab off, and darken the skin where the blisters appear, leaving no scars. But if the patient gets infected with blisters, it can leave scars, especially if there is multiple infection. Some have a slightly concave base, which can cause long-term or permanent scars.",
