    "subsection_content": "The period of transmission of chickenpox by the varicella-zoster virus is 1-2 days before the rash appears and until all the blisters have crusted over. So who is at risk of getting chickenpox? Chickenpox is common in children under 10 years old, but this does not mean that adults do not get the disease. People of all ages can get chickenpox, and children between 6 months and 7 years old are most susceptible to the virus. Particularly in adults (over 20 years old), the rate of chickenpox is less, about 10% due to immunity.\nPeople who have had chickenpox usually have lifelong immunity, but about 1% are reinfected. Some people may get chickenpox more than once in their lives, but this is very rare. For people who have been vaccinated against chickenpox and still get the disease, the symptoms are usually milder, with fewer blisters and mild or no fever.",
