    "subsection_content": "Since ancient times, chickenpox was considered a mild smallpox disease, which proves that the disease is classified as a mild disease. However, the disease can still become serious in patients who do not receive medical care or do not follow the doctor's instructions.\nSome complications of chickenpox that can be dangerous include: (3)\nInfections of the skin, soft tissues, bones, joints and blood are the most common complications. It is the blisters that burst and are itchy and uncomfortable, so many people \"breach\" the wound with dirty hands or do not clean it properly, leading to internal bleeding and infection. This is a common complication in young children who cannot \"control\" the itchy, uncomfortable blisters.; Encephalitis is a complication that can occur in children and adults, but is more common in adults and can lead to death if not treated promptly. Complications usually appear 1 week after the patient develops blisters. When experiencing this complication, the patient may have symptoms of high fever, coma, convulsions, mental disorders, and nystagmus. This complication can cause death if not treated promptly.; Chickenpox pneumonia with symptoms of coughing a lot, coughing up blood, difficulty breathing, and chest tightness is a complication of chickenpox that often occurs in adults, on days 3 - 5 after the onset of the disease.; Nephritis and acute glomerulonephritis are also complications caused by chickenpox. The rash appears late on the 3rd or 4th day of the disease. The most easily observable signs are the patient's bloody urine and kidney failure.; Effusion arthritis is also found in severe forms, the joints have inflammation and effusion, rarely pus. Not to mention, in some cases, chickenpox can be combined with another infectious disease that co-occurs such as diphtheria, whooping cough, or measles. When suffering from many forms of this disease at the same time, the patient's condition is often severe enough to clinically overwhelm chickenpox.\nIf a person has had chickenpox, they are still at risk for another complication, shingles. The virus that causes varicella-zoster remains in nerve cells after the infected blisters on the skin have healed. Years later, if the body is older or the immune system is weakened, the virus can reactivate and recur as shingles - a cluster of blisters that cause short-term pain. The pain from shingles can last long after the blisters disappear. This pain is called postherpetic neuralgia and can be severe.\nIn addition, people with chickenpox may experience some complications such as otitis media and external ear, oral mucositis, myocarditis, lymphadenitis, neuritis, pseudocroup syndrome, and laryngitis due to other diseases. Chickenpox pimples that grow in this area cause ulcers, infection, and swelling. Or complications of dehydration, toxic shock syndrome, Reye's syndrome in children and adolescents using aspirin to treat chickenpox.\nSubjects susceptible to complications from chickenpox include: Newborns whose mothers have never had chickenpox or have not been vaccinated; Pregnant women who are not sick, people with weakened immune systems such as HIV, chemotherapy, immunosuppressive drugs, asthma, etc.",
