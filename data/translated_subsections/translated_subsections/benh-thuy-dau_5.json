    "subsection_content": "Chickenpox is transmitted by the varicella-zoster virus, mainly when the weather is warm and humid like spring, which is a favorable time for the acute spread of the disease. The virus can be spread through direct contact with the rash area. Or the virus spreads when a person with chickenpox coughs or sneezes and a healthy person inhales air droplets containing the virus. Pregnant women who get chickenpox 5 days before giving birth or 2 days after giving birth can transmit chickenpox from mother to baby, and the fetus can be born with disabilities or die. Many medical evidences show that low birth weight and limb abnormalities are more common when pregnant women have chickenpox. When a mother is infected with chickenpox in the week before giving birth or within a few days after giving birth, the fetus is at high risk not only of serious but also life-threatening infections such as stillbirth. Therefore, pregnant women need to check their health to see if they have chickenpox, so that doctors can monitor the pregnancy and have timely treatment. (4)\nIf you are pregnant and not immune to chickenpox, talk to your doctor about the risks to you and your unborn baby.",
