    "subsection_content": "Pathologies belonging to the group of non-cyanotic congenital heart defects include: (2)\nAortic stenosis: The aorta is the main artery that carries blood from the heart to other organs. The aortic valve is located between the heart and the aorta. It opens and closes with each cardiac cycle to move blood out of the heart, while keeping blood from flowing back into the heart. Aortic valve stenosis is a condition in which the valve is narrowed and does not open and close well.\nThe aorta can be narrowed in different locations, but the most common is coarctation of the aorta (the area corresponding to the aortopulmonary ligament, behind the bifurcation of the left subclavian artery).\nPulmonary stenosis: The pulmonary artery carries oxygen-poor blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs for oxygenation. The pulmonary valve is located between the right side of the heart and the pulmonary artery. When the pulmonary valve is narrowed and does not open and close well, it will cause pulmonary valve stenosis.; Atrial septal defect: Atrial septal defect (ASD) refers to a condition in which a hole appears in the wall between the two upper chambers of the heart (right atrium and left atrium). Most small atrial septal defects close spontaneously. For larger holes, your doctor will perform a cardiac catheterization procedure or open-heart surgery to close it.; Ventricular septal defect: The most common heart defect, ventricular septal defect (VSD) occurs when there is a hole in the wall between the two lower chambers of the heart (right and left ventricles). Similar to an atrial septal defect, a ventricular septal defect can close spontaneously or require surgical intervention to close the hole.; Atrioventricular canal: This defect refers to an opening located in the center of the heart, in the wall that separates the upper chambers (atria) from the lower chambers (ventricles). Most people with atrioventricular canal disease have abnormalities in certain heart valves (mitral valve and tricuspid valve). Atrioventricular canal defects are also known as endocardial cushion defects; Bicuspid aortic valve: The aortic valve is a one-way passageway between the heart and the aorta. The valve usually has 3 flaps that open and close to regulate the flow of blood. The bicuspid aortic valve has only 2 pieces, causing the valve to not function normally.; Aortic coarctation: This disease occurs when the aorta is compressed or narrowed, restricting blood flow through it.",
