    "subsection_content": "Non-cyanotic congenital heart defects can be detected in the fetus, when the fetus is 17 weeks or older.; After the baby is born, the doctor will hear the baby's heart murmur. If a child is suspected of having a non-cyanotic congenital heart defect, the doctor will conduct paraclinical tests such as: Chest X-ray: to determine abnormalities in the heart structure. Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG): measures the electrical activity of the heart. Echocardiogram: looks at the heart's valves and chambers. Right heart catheterization: helps determine how well the heart is pumping blood. A thin tube is inserted through the femoral vein to the heart, thereby measuring the amount of blood the heart pumps per minute and the amount of oxygen in the blood in each chamber of the heart. Left heart catheterization: This method is similar to right heart catheterization, but is performed on the left side of the heart.; Chest X-ray: to identify structural abnormalities of the heart; Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG): measures the heart's electrical activity; Echocardiography: observes images of the valves and chambers of the heart; Right heart catheterization: helps determine how well the heart is pumping blood.
