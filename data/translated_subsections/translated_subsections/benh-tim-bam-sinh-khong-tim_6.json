    "subsection_content": "If your baby is born with a small ventricular/atrial septal defect, he or she does not need treatment because the defect is likely to close on its own. Similarly, mild pulmonary valve stenosis/aortic valve stenosis does not require intervention. The doctor will recommend that parents take their children for regular checkups to monitor the progression of the disease. (4)\nIn cases where a child's non-cyanotic congenital heart defect is moderate to severe, causing serious symptoms, the child needs treatment methods such as:\nMedication use: Children are prescribed medications to help the heart work more effectively, control blood pressure, prevent blood clots or control irregular heartbeat.; Interventional cardiac catheterization: This procedure helps doctors treat some congenital heart defects without needing open chest and heart surgery, including pulmonary valvuloplasty, aortic valvuloplasty, dilatation and stent placement. Aortic coarctation, atrial septal defect occlusion, ventricular septal defect occlusion... The doctor will thread the catheter through the vein in the thigh and up to the heart, then insert tools through the catheter to treat the heart defect.; Open heart surgery: This method is applied to cases that cannot be intervened with minimally invasive cardiac catheterization techniques. The doctor makes an incision in the middle of the chest to access the heart, close holes in the heart, repair heart valves, or widen blood vessels.; Heart transplant: In cases where the patient's condition is too complex or the disease is advanced enough to threaten serious complications, a heart transplant may be needed. The patient's heart is replaced with a healthy heart from a donor.\nAfter surgery, the heart will function almost normally. However, as patients age, they may experience related cardiovascular problems. Additionally, if there is scar tissue on the heart (as a result of surgery), this increases the risk of:\nIrregular heartbeat or arrhythmia; Cyanosis; Dizziness and fainting; Swelling of organs or body tissues (edema); Shortness of breath; Fatigue, especially after exertion\nIn addition, non-cyanotic congenital heart defects that have mild symptoms that do not require surgery during childhood can get worse over time and require treatment as the child matures.",
