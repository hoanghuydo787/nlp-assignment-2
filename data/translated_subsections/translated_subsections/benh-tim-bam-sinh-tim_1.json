    "subsection_content": "There are 3 types of cyanotic congenital heart disease: (2)\n1. Obstructive lesions of the left heart\nThese congenital heart defects reduce blood flow between the heart and the rest of the body (systemic blood flow). Pathologies in this group include:\nHypoplastic left heart syndrome: is a condition in which the left side of the heart is very underdeveloped and cannot perform the normal pumping function. The cause is that the left ventricle is too small or non-existent. In addition, the left heart valves (aortic and mitral valves) do not function normally, leading to the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood leaving the heart (the aorta) being smaller than normal. Therefore, the right side of the heart is responsible for pumping blood to the lungs, and the left heart has to take on the task of pumping blood to other organs.\nChildren with hypoplastic left heart syndrome need early surgery to avoid life-threatening complications.\nAortic arch rupture: The aorta is a large blood vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood from the heart throughout the body. Interrupted aortic arch is a rare condition in which a child's aorta develops incompletely or is interrupted. This means the heart cannot send blood through the aorta. If blood does not reach any part of the body, the child may go into shock and die.\n2. Right heart obstructive lesions\nThis group of congenital heart defects reduces blood flow between the heart and lungs. Specific pathologies include:\nPulmonary hypoplasia: This is a heart defect that is often diagnosed soon after birth. In pulmonary stenosis, the valve that carries blood from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary valve) does not form properly. Instead of opening and closing to allow blood to pass from the heart to the lungs, this valve becomes blocked. So the blood cannot follow its normal path to get oxygen from the lungs. Instead, blood must reach the lungs through other natural pathways in the heart and nearby arteries.; Tricuspid valve atrophy: This disease occurs when the heart's tricuspid valve does not form. The normal tricuspid valve is located between two chambers on the right side of the heart: the right atrium (upper chamber) and the right ventricle (lower chamber). In children with tricuspid valve atresia, the heart has fibrous tissue instead of the tricuspid valve. This sheet of tissue blocks blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle – the normal circulation of blood.\nTricuspid valve atresia limits blood flow from the heart to the lungs, causing the right ventricle to be small and underdeveloped. In addition, another dangerous complication is lack of oxygen to the body's tissues. This condition is called hypoxemia.\nTetralogy of Fallot: This is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease, involving 4 heart defects: ventricular septal defect, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, aortic overriding and right ventricular hypertrophy. These abnormalities make it difficult for the child's heart to provide enough oxygen to the entire body. Specifically, some blood without oxygen can enter the aorta and exit the body instead of going to the pulmonary artery to get oxygen.\nHealthy heart and congenital heart disease Tetralogy of Fallot\n3. Mixed lesions\nThe third group of cyanotic congenital heart disease is called mixed lesions. These heart defects cause the child's body to mix up pulmonary and systemic blood flow. Pathologies in this group include:\nTransposition of the great arteries: This defect is the second most common cyanotic congenital heart disease. In it, the positions of the two main arteries leaving the heart (pulmonary artery and aorta) are reversed. The aorta is connected to the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery is connected to the left ventricle – completely opposite to the anatomy of a normal heart. At this time, oxygen-poor (blue) blood from the body returns to the right atrium, enters the right ventricle, then enters the aorta and returns to the body. Oxygen-rich (red) blood returns to the left atrium from the lungs and enters the left ventricle, which pumps blood back to the lungs – the opposite of how blood normally circulates.\nTransposition of the great arteries is a critical condition and to survive, the newborn needs early surgery.\nAbnormal total pulmonary venous return (TAPVR): In a baby with this heart defect, the pulmonary blood vessels (pulmonary veins) are attached to the wrong place in the heart. Normally, oxygen-rich blood travels from the lungs to the left atrium and then circulates throughout the body. In TAPVR, abnormal connection of veins sends blood through the right atrium, where it mixes with oxygen-poor blood.; Truncus arteriosus: Babies born with truncus arteriosus have only one main artery to carry blood to the body and lungs, instead of two separate arteries.",
