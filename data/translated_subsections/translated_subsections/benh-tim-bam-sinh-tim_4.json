    "subsection_content": "Normally, hypoxic blood (blue blood) is sent to the right side of the heart to pump blood to the lungs for oxygen. The blood coming out of the lungs is oxygen-rich blood (called red blood). This flow of red blood continues toward the left side of the heart. From here, it is pumped throughout the body.\nIn children with cyanotic congenital heart defects, blood circulation through the heart and lungs is not normal, causing less blood to reach the lungs or mixing blue and red blood. This causes poorly oxygenated blood to be pumped out of the body, causing the child's skin to turn blue (cyanotic).\nRisk factor\nBabies are more at risk of cyanotic congenital heart disease if they have a family history of congenital heart disease. Some genetic syndromes considered to cause this disease include Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, Marfan syndrome and Noonan syndrome.\nIn addition, the following objective factors also increase the likelihood of cyanotic congenital heart disease in children:\nHeart valve defects such as tricuspid valve, aortic valve or pulmonary valve defects;; Mother exposed to toxic chemicals during pregnancy;; Mother has an infection during pregnancy, such as flu, measles, rubella;; Mother has gestational diabetes but does not control blood sugar well;; Pregnant mothers arbitrarily use certain drugs that are harmful to the fetus;; Mother used drugs and abused alcohol during pregnancy.\nPregnant mothers with diabetes have a higher risk of giving birth to children with cyanotic congenital heart defects",
