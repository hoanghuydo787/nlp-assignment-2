    "subsection_content": "Treatment for cyanotic congenital heart disease depends on the severity of the disease. Commonly chosen methods include:\nCardiac catheterization: In this procedure, the doctor threads a catheter through a blood vessel in the thigh to the heart, then inserts an instrument to repair the defect. The cardiac catheterization method does not require opening the chest and performing surgery directly on the heart, so the child recovers quickly after the intervention.; Open heart surgery: This method is applied in cases that cannot be treated with cardiac catheterization. Congenital heart surgery can take place immediately after birth or several months or even years later. Children after surgery need to have their health monitored for life.\nIn severe cases, a combination of both cardiac catheterization and open-heart surgery may be needed to repair the entire heart defect.\nHeart transplant: This is a method indicated for children with multiple heart defects of a complex nature, to replace the defective heart with a healthy heart from a donor.; Medication: Medication is prescribed based on the nature of the heart defect and the severity of symptoms.",
