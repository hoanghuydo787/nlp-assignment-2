    "subsection_content": "Doctor Vu Nang Phuc said that some common congenital heart defects in children include: (2)\nObstructive congenital heart disease group\nAortic valve stenosis: This is one of the severe congenital heart defects. The aortic valve controls the flow of blood from the heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle) to the aorta and the entire body. When the aortic valve is narrowed, it reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the body's organs, causing the left ventricle to work harder. Most children with aortic valve stenosis have no symptoms. Valve stenosis can progress over time. Therefore, close monitoring is needed for surgery or percutaneous intervention to resolve this blockage when indicated.; Pulmonary valve stenosis: The pulmonary valve is located between the pulmonary artery and the right ventricle. Normally, when the valve opens, blood is pumped from the right ventricle to the lungs. However, when the pulmonary valve is narrowed, the heart works harder to pump blood through the narrowing to the lungs. In this case, valvuloplasty or open heart surgery can be applied; Subaortic stenosis: This is a narrowing of the left ventricle below the aortic valve, leading to a reduction in the size of the left ventricle's blood flow, thickening the left ventricle wall. This defect can be congenital, or due to heart muscle diseases (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy).; Aortic coarctation: a narrowed aorta reduces blood flow to the lower body, while blood pressure increases above the narrowed area. Most children with coarctation of the aorta have no symptoms at birth, but symptoms may appear as early as the first week after birth.; 2-piece aortic valve: This is a case where a baby is born with a 2-piece aortic valve instead of the normal 3-piece aortic valve. The 2-piece valve will often degenerate early and quickly, causing valve stenosis and aortic dilation. This defect is often discovered when children become adults, in some cases symptoms appear as early as adolescence.\nGroup of septal defects\nAtrial septal defect: The interatrial septum separating the right and left atria has a hole in it (instead of being completely closed) allowing blood to circulate between the two atria. If there is only an isolated atrial septal defect, there are almost no symptoms in infants and young children.; Ventricular septal defect: Ventricular septal defect is caused by a defect in the formation of the septum between the left and right ventricles. This opening allows blood to flow from the left ventricle to the right ventricle, leading to dilation of the left heart chamber and increased blood flow to the lungs.\nCyanotic congenital heart disease group\nCyanotic congenital heart disease is a condition in which the blood supply to the body contains less oxygen than normal, leading to the baby becoming cyanotic at birth or shortly after birth.\nTetralogy of Fallot: This is a common congenital heart defect with 4 characteristics: \"riding of the aorta\", ventricular septal defect, stenosis at the valve and/or below the pulmonary valve causing obstruction of blood to the lungs and right ventricle. thick. Children with tetralogy of Fallot need open heart surgery to close the ventricular septal defect, widen the pulmonary stenosis that blocks blood to the lungs, and need lifelong health monitoring.; Tricuspid valve atrophy: Children with this condition will not have a tricuspid valve, resulting in no blood from the right atrium directly to the right ventricle. At this time, cardiac catheterization or bypass surgery is needed to increase blood flow to the lungs.; Transposition of the great arteries: The positions of the aorta and pulmonary artery are reversed, specifically the aorta originates from the right ventricle, low-oxygenated blood returning to the heart cannot reach the lungs to get oxygen but is continued pumped out to organs to provide oxygen. In contrast, the pulmonary artery originates from the left ventricle, oxygenated blood from the lungs returns to the left heart and continues to be pumped back to the lungs to get oxygen. This congenital heart defect requires early intervention after birth.\nSee more: Ancyanotic congenital heart disease: Causes, symptoms, treatment\nGroup of other congenital heart defects\nHypoplastic left heart syndrome: The left ventricle, aorta, aortic valve and mitral valve develop abnormally, causing blood to reach the aorta through the ductus arteriosus. In case the ductus arteriosus closes after birth, the baby is at risk of death.; Patent ductus arteriosus: Normally, the ductus arteriosus (artery connecting the aorta and pulmonary artery) will close on its own after birth. In case this tube does not close, the child will have a \"patent ductus arteriosus\" defect, causing blood to flow from the aorta through the pulmonary artery, increasing blood flow to the lungs, causing pulmonary hypertension in the long term. Catheterization of the ductus arteriosus using a device is the first choice. In some special cases, surgical ligation/ligation of the ductus arteriosus is an alternative.; Ebstein anomaly: is a tricuspid valve disease. The valve leaflet will move toward the apex of the heart due to adhesion to the heart wall, so the right atrium will be larger, and the right ventricle will be atrialized so it will be smaller than normal. Abnormal tricuspid valve causes mild to severe valve regurgitation, and severe cases can cause narrowing of the right ventricular outflow tract. This defect is also often accompanied by accessory pathway arrhythmias.\nSee also: Pulmonary hypertension in newborns: Causes, signs and treatments",
