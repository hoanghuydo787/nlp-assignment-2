    "subsection_content": "Complications of congenital heart disease can continue to develop over time, even after the child has received treatment, including: (5)\nArrhythmia: A condition in which the heart beats irregularly, too fast or too slow. In some patients, arrhythmia can cause stroke or sudden death if not treated promptly and properly.; Heart infection: Also known as endocarditis, is an infection of the endocardium of the heart, usually occurring when germs enter the bloodstream and travel to the heart. Endocarditis can damage or destroy heart valves, even cause embolism, causing stroke; Stroke: Congenital heart defects can cause blood clots to form in the heart, causing blood clots, reducing or blocking blood supply to the brain.; Pulmonary hypertension: Is a condition of increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries, largely due to increased blood flow to the lungs.; Heart failure: Some congenital heart defects are not detected and treated promptly, leading to the heart not pumping enough blood compared to the body's needs, leading to heart failure.\nSee more: How long can you live with congenital heart disease?
