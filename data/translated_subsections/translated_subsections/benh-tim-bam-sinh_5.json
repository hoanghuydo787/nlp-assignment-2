Statistics show that about 10-15% of sick newborns need medical treatment or surgery in the first month of life. Therefore, screening by measuring oxygen saturation is now performed on all newborns before discharge from the hospital.\nNext, cases with suspicious signs are comprehensively diagnosed to accurately detect the cause by means of:\nElectrocardiogram ECG;; Chest X-ray;; Echocardiography;; Routine blood tests (when necessary); Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or cardiac computed tomography or cardiac catheterization, in some cases.\nSee more: Can fetal echocardiography detect congenital heart disease?\nDepending on the examination and necessary tests, each patient will have a specific treatment regimen",
