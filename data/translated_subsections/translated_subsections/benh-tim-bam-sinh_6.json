    "subsection_content": "“Can congenital heart disease be cured?” is a question that many parents of young children with this disease are interested in. Doctor Vu Nang Phuc said that children with congenital heart disease can still develop healthily and normally like their peers if they are detected early and treated properly. Depending on the specific condition, the doctor will give advice and a specific treatment regimen, usually there are 3 methods as follows:\n1. Using medicine\nMost asymptomatic cases do not require medication, but children need periodic monitoring as directed by a doctor. In some cases, children are prescribed certain medications to treat heart failure, arrhythmia, etc., which can be short-term or long-term.\n2. Percutaneous intervention\nThis is a modern treatment method that has recently been strongly developed by the Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital. Doctors will use a small and long tube to pass through the blood vessels leading to the heart, to measure parameters or insert interventional tools such as dilating narrow valves, placing stents (arterial ducts, etc.). right ventricular outflow tract, collateral circulation, coarctation of the aorta, pulmonary artery stenosis...) or blockage of abnormal shunts (aortopulmonary circulation, coronary fistula, pulmonary arteriovenous fistula) or valve replacement pulmonary vessels through the skin.\nOutstanding advantages of this method include no need to open the sternum, pain reduction, and quick recovery time; while minimizing the risk of infection. Applicable treatment in cases of defects such as aortic valve stenosis, pulmonary valve stenosis, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus... at a reasonable cost at the Heart Center , Tam Anh General Hospital.\n3. Heart surgery\nIn cases where percutaneous intervention is not possible, doctors will perform surgery from simple to complex to close the holes, widen pulmonary artery stenosis, aortic coarctation, mBTT shunt surgery, Fontan, Kawashima surgery, Senning - Rastelli surgery, atrioventricular canal repair, heart valve repair or replacement, Ozaki surgery, collateral circulation connection, great artery transposition surgery...",
