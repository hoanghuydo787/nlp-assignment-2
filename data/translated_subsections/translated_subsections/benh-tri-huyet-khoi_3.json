    "subsection_content": "Supplementing soluble and insoluble fiber combined with other treatments will help relieve hemorrhoid congestion\n1. For external hemorrhoids, embolize 1 bunch\nThe patient is injected with a local anesthetic containing epinephrine to help stop bleeding and swelling. This method can cause pain for several weeks after surgery and is often applied to severe acute hemorrhoids, causing edema, necrosis, and preventing mucosal closure.\n2. For mixed hemorrhoids with embolism\nThe doctor will apply hemorrhoidectomy with a Plasma knife if there is a ring-shaped blockage, or thrombectomy, or thrombosed hemorrhoidectomy combined with Longo surgery on the remaining unembolized hemorrhoids.\n3. For angioembolic internal hemorrhoids\nDepending on how large or small the hemorrhoids are, whether the hemorrhoids are large or small, the treating doctor will choose one of the following combined methods:\n• Thrombectomy + Longo surgery: This procedure is also known as circumferential mucosectomy or prolapse and hemorrhoidectomy (PPH) procedure with the advantages of less pain, shorter surgery time, and faster recovery. , reducing the risk of recurrence. The surgeon will use staples to perform cutting and suturing at the same time to fix the internal hemorrhoidal tissue to the rectal wall. The Longo method is prone to complications such as bleeding from the staple wire, uncontrolled sphincter injury; The risk of vaginal fistula reappearing in women... therefore requires a highly skilled and experienced surgeon.\n• Thrombectomy + Diode Laser hemorrhoid burning surgery: This method uses carbon dioxide or Nd Yag Laser to burn or remove hemorrhoids accurately, quickly, and painlessly. Laser therapy can be used alone or in combination with other modalities. This is an outpatient procedure that can be applied to most patients with level I, level II and level III hemorrhoids.\n• Thrombectomy + THD hemorrhoid surgery: This is a surgical method that causes less pain, reduces bleeding and tissue prolapse. This method uses a Doppler probe to identify the six major feeding arteries in the anal canal. The doctor will then ligate these arteries with absorbable sutures and a specialized scope to cut excess arteries in the hemorrhoidal lining.\n• Thrombectomy + Endoscopic hemorrhoid sclerotherapy injection: This is a unique treatment feature of Tam Anh General Hospital. This method has the advantage of only requiring one injection, little pain, very short hospital stay, the patient can go home the same day after the procedure, quick recovery and low treatment costs. This method is highly effective for bleeding hemorrhoids, hemorrhoids that do not prolapse much, hemorrhoids that are not too large, hemorrhoids with underlying diseases that require anticoagulants, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, etc.",
