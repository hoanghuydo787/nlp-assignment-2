    "subsection_content": "Internal hemorrhoids are a medical condition caused by veins in the anorectal area (above the dentate line) being swollen/bulging due to excessive elasticity and can cause a number of uncomfortable problems, even if the patient the disease does not feel them. Internal hemorrhoids form near the end of the rectum and cannot be seen or felt by the patient, unless they prolapse.\nInternal hemorrhoids can be more difficult to diagnose than external hemorrhoids because the hemorrhoids are hidden inside the rectum. In men, due to strong pelvic floor muscles, internal hemorrhoids rarely prolapse, so patients only come to the doctor when there are bleeding complications. Anyone can get internal hemorrhoids, but it is most common in people between 28 and 50 years old. (2)",
