    "subsection_content": "Signs of internal hemorrhoids vary depending on the severity of each stage of the disease. Even more severe internal hemorrhoids usually do not cause pain due to the lack of nerve endings in the lower rectal area. If pain occurs, it is usually caused by a related condition, such as anal fissures or external hemorrhoids.\nIn most cases, the manifestation of internal hemorrhoids is usually bleeding. Patients may see bright red blood in stools or on toilet paper when wiping. However, if there is only light bleeding, it will be difficult for the patient to recognize this condition.\nWhile bleeding is the most common sign of internal hemorrhoids, you may also experience other symptoms if the hemorrhoids prolapse. This often happens during bowel movements and in many cases, the hemorrhoid will retract on its own or the patient may have to push it back in with their hands. In the case of level IV hemorrhoids, hemorrhoidal tissue still prolapses despite manual intervention.\nIt is important to note that bleeding symptoms are common in both colorectal cancer and internal hemorrhoids. Therefore, patients should go to the hospital for examination and diagnosis if they have rectal bleeding, especially when this symptom is accompanied by other suspicious signs.\nHemorrhoids that prolapse outside the anus can cause discomfort because of itching and swelling. Some people even get dirty due to prolapsed tissue. It is difficult to know whether a person has prolapsed hemorrhoids or external hemorrhoids without a professional diagnosis from a doctor because the symptoms of these conditions are similar. In addition, patients can also have both external hemorrhoids and prolapsed hemorrhoids at the same time.(3)",
