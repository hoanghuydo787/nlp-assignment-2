    "subsection_content": "There are many options for treating internal hemorrhoids. Among them, methods to relieve pain, itching or discomfort include topical baths, over-the-counter creams and ointments, or natural home remedies such as applying aloe vera, apple cider vinegar, and soaking the anus in warm water. … very popular.\nHowever, these treatments only provide temporary results. Internal hemorrhoid treatment should aim to solve the long-term problem by actually removing the internal hemorrhoids. Therefore, the following treatment methods will be more feasible for people with this type of hemorrhoids.\n1. Coagulation\nA less invasive option than surgery is infrared coagulation (IRC) to treat internal hemorrhoids. This method is performed by the doctor shining infrared light inside the hemorrhoid. The heat of infrared rays will cause scar tissue to form, cutting off blood flow to the hemorrhoids. About a week later, the dead tissue will fall out of the anus and there is a chance that the wound will bleed slightly.\nCompared to the rubber band ligation procedure, this method has a higher recurrence rate.\n2. Sclerotherapy\nAnother minimally invasive treatment option is sclerotherapy. This method is performed by the doctor injecting a chemical solution into the swollen veins in the rectum, damaging the veins and causing them to shrink. This procedure may need to be repeated several times to ensure the hemorrhoids are eliminated. Sclerotherapy is most effective for mild, less progressive internal hemorrhoids.\nThe Anorectal Unit of Tam Anh General Hospital has strengths in performing endoscopic hemorrhoid sclerotherapy with the advantage of very little pain, only needing one injection, very short hospital stay, and returning home the same day. , quick recovery, low treatment costs, advantages in cases of bleeding hemorrhoids, hemorrhoids that do not prolapse much, hemorrhoids that are not too big, hemorrhoids with underlying diseases that require anticoagulants, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes...\n3. Ligation of hemorrhoids using the CRH O'Regan method\nThis is one of the best ways to get rid of internal hemorrhoids and prevent their recurrence. Hemorrhoid ligation with CRH O'Regan is a great alternative to other hemorrhoid ligation methods. Instead of using metal clamps, this method uses a small disposable connector that applies gentle suction. This method requires no preparation or use of sedatives, is painless, and causes no discomfort after the procedure. However, this method is not currently popular.(1)\n4. Ligation of hemorrhoids\nHemorrhoid ligation is one of the less invasive methods. This procedure works by cutting off blood flow to the hemorrhoids, killing the tissue and leaving scar tissue. This scar tissue helps prevent hemorrhoids from recurring.\nThis procedure is performed by the doctor tying the internal hemorrhoids with rubber bands and holding them in place with metal clips to cut off blood circulation to the hemorrhoidal tissues. This method can be painful, so the patient needs a certain amount of time to recover.\n5. Surgery\nSurgical methods are invasive and can cause more pain and longer recovery times than the above procedures. Therefore, surgery should be considered a last resort if the above measures are ineffective.\nAt Tam Anh General Hospital, doctors in the Anorectal unit perform painless hemorrhoid surgery by choosing the correct surgical method (Longo, Laser, THD ultrasound...) suitable for each type of hemorrhoid. , as well as using a cold Plasmablade with less burns, less pain and faster healing.",
