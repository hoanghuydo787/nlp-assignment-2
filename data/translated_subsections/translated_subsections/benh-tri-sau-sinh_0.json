Veins in the rectum or anus are responsible for returning blood to the heart. When these veins swell due to pressure, blood pools in the veins, causing hemorrhoids. Pregnant mothers who have hemorrhoids during pregnancy have a high risk of developing this disease after giving birth. This condition is more common in pregnant women who give birth vaginally.\nBased on the location of hemorrhoids, the disease is divided into two types: internal hemorrhoids and external hemorrhoids.\n1. Internal hemorrhoids\nInternal hemorrhoids appear when hemorrhoids affect the veins in the rectum and anus. Internal hemorrhoids are divided into 4 levels:\nLevel 1: This is the mildest stage when hemorrhoids are just starting to form inside the anal canal. At this time, the patient feels a burning pain when going to the toilet, and slight itching; Level 1: This is the mildest stage when hemorrhoids are just starting to form inside the anal canal. At this time, the patient feels a burning pain when going to the toilet and mild itching.\nLevel 2: The patient begins to feel more uncomfortable and has more bloody stools. When you push, a small lump of flesh will appear outside the anal canal.; Level 2: The patient begins to feel more uncomfortable and has more bloody stools. When you push, a small lump of flesh will appear protruding from the anal canal.\nLevel 3: Hemorrhoids prolapse outside the anal canal and cannot shrink if the patient does not push them in with their hands. At this level, the pain will increase, especially when defecating or sitting.; Level 3: Hemorrhoids prolapse outside the anal canal and cannot shrink if the patient does not push them in with their hands. At this level, the pain will increase, especially when defecating or sitting.\nLevel 4: Hemorrhoids completely prolapse and cannot be pushed inside the anal canal. The patient always feels pain and the bleeding does not stop whether sitting or standing.; Level 4: Hemorrhoids completely prolapse and cannot be pushed inside the anal canal. The patient always feels pain and the bleeding does not stop whether sitting or standing.\n2. External hemorrhoids\nExternal hemorrhoids are hemorrhoids that develop under the skin, around the anus. External hemorrhoids are also divided into 4 levels:\nLevel 1: At this time, the hemorrhoids are only as small as a pea, the patient feels a little lumpy in the anus when sitting, and a little blood appears when defecating.; Level 1: At this time, the hemorrhoids are only as small as a pea, the patient feels a little lumpy in the anus when sitting, and a little blood appears when defecating.\nLevel 2: The hemorrhoids grow into a larger lump, creating a feeling of difficulty when sitting or standing. At that time, the patient will feel more pain, accompanied by burning and itching of the anus. Hemorrhoids are larger and cause a feeling of discomfort even when standing or sitting.; Level 2: The hemorrhoids grow into a larger lump, creating a feeling of difficulty when sitting or standing. At that time, the patient will feel more pain, accompanied by burning and itching of the anus. Hemorrhoids are larger and cause a feeling of discomfort even when standing or sitting.\nLevel 3: Hemorrhoids have prolapsed, causing anal obstruction. Because the size of hemorrhoids is large, bleeding can easily occur when defecating or rubbing against pants.; Level 3: Hemorrhoids have prolapsed, causing anal obstruction. Because the size of hemorrhoids is large, bleeding can easily occur when defecating or rubbing against pants.\nLevel 4: Hemorrhoids fall completely, causing severe pain. At this time, if left untreated, the patient is at high risk of developing anal diseases.; Level 4: Hemorrhoids fall completely, causing severe pain. At this time, if left untreated, the patient is at high risk of developing anal diseases.",
