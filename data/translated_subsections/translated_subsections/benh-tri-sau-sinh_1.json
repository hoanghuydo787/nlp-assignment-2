    "subsection_content": "There are many causes of hemorrhoids after giving birth, including:\n1. Pushing a lot during childbirth\nPushing too much or improperly during labor will cause the uterus to expand, increasing pressure on the abdomen, especially the pelvic cavity. This leads to hematoma, swelling of the anus, causing hemorrhoids to fall out.\n2. Frequent constipation\nFrequent constipation during pregnancy or after pregnancy is one of the causes of postpartum hemorrhoids. When constipated, the patient tends to strain a lot when defecating. This dilates the veins in the rectum, forming hemorrhoids.\nConstipation can occur due to:\nHormonal changes affect the digestive system. During pregnancy, the amount of progesterol increases, slowing down intestinal motility, easily causing constipation; A diet low in green vegetables, drinking little water but supplemented with lots of calcium, iron...; Sit or lie down a lot, move less during pregnancy; Use pain relievers; Limited bowel movements due to episiotomy pain\n3. Weight of the fetus\nIncreased fetal weight, especially in the last months of pregnancy, will create pressure on the rectum and anus. At that time, the veins are compressed, blood cannot circulate, causing blood vessels to dilate and swell, forming hemorrhoids.\n4. Ever had hemorrhoids\nIf the mother has had hemorrhoids or constipation during pregnancy, not only is the risk of postpartum hemorrhoids higher, but the condition can also be more serious. The reason is that during pregnancy, progesterone levels increase, causing veins to dilate and blood stasis to become increasingly serious, making people who have had hemorrhoids prone to recurrence. Postpartum hemorrhoids in these pregnant mothers can cause edema, embolism and bleeding of hemorrhoids.",
