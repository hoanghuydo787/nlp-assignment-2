    "subsection_content": "Depending on the severity, the signs of postpartum hemorrhoids in each person may be different, but in general, include common symptoms such as: (1)\n1. Blood in stool\nIn the early stages, the patient's frequency of bloody stools is low and the amount of blood is also low. The patient can only detect it by looking at toilet paper or blood in the stool.\nOver time, as hemorrhoids become more severe, bloody bowel movements become more and more serious. The number of bloody bowel movements increases, the amount of blood flowing during each bowel movement is also more, the patient can even feel the blood flowing out clearly. Sometimes, blood flowing from hemorrhoids clots in the rectum, leading to blood clots in the stool.\n2. Prolapse of hemorrhoids after giving birth\nAt a mild level (grade 1 or 2), hemorrhoids after giving birth have little or no impact on daily activities. When hemorrhoids have developed (from level 3 or higher), hemorrhoid prolapse appears, making the patient feel extremely uncomfortable and sore in the anus; especially when defecating, carrying heavy loads or moving a lot.\n3. Anal itching\nAnal itching is also one of the common signs of postpartum hemorrhoids. Itching and discomfort in the anus make the patient lose confidence when communicating or having to go out.\n4. Anal swelling and pain\nWhen external hemorrhoids become embolized or internal hemorrhoids prolapse causing blockage, it will cause pain and swelling in the anus. This condition causes severe pain, the patient cannot sit, walk or do normal activities; Some patients even describe the level of pain as being worse than during labor.\n5. Burning anal fissures\nThis sign occurs when hemorrhoids are left untreated for a long time. At that time, the anus may begin to crack, causing burning and discomfort, and the patient is also susceptible to bleeding when going to the toilet.\n6. Other symptoms\nIn addition to the above signs of postpartum hemorrhoids, patients may experience other symptoms such as:\nMucus secretion at the anal opening; Appearance of sensitive lumps near the anus; Perianal dermatitis; Rectal inflammation; Fatigue and weakness due to blood loss.",
