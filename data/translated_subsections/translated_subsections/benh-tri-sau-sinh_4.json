Possible complications range from severe to mild, such as: pain, bleeding, urinary retention, anal stenosis and infection.\nIn addition, there are some other less invasive hemorrhoid treatment procedures such as:\nSclerotherapy: A chemical solution will be injected into hemorrhoid tissue to shrink it. Although less painful, this method is less effective than hemorrhoid ligation. Endoscopic hemorrhoid sclerotherapy injection is a minimally invasive technique being applied at Tam Anh General Hospital, and is the optimal technique for mothers because only a single dose of antibiotics is used, limiting milk loss.; Sclerotherapy: A chemical solution will be injected into hemorrhoid tissue to shrink it.
