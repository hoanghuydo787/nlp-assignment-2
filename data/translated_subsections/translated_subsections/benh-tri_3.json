Most patients only come for examination when the hemorrhoids have grown large, causing friction, bleeding, and pain. However, treating hemorrhoids in stage 4 will be much more difficult and expensive because hemorrhoids have developed many complications over time.\nThe most common complications of hemorrhoids include:\nAnemia: frequent anal bleeding can lead to chronic anemia, a decrease in red blood cell indexes in the blood. Although not life-threatening, chronic anemia leaves the patient in a state of exhaustion and physical weakness, seriously affecting the quality of life. In severe cases, the patient may need a blood transfusion or hospitalization for treatment. In particular, bleeding from hemorrhoids in men is often more serious than in women. The reason is because the anal canal in women is not deep, internal hemorrhoids come out early, helping to detect and treat them early. Meanwhile, the anal tract in men is deeper so it is difficult to detect. Once blood is passed out, the hemorrhoids are very large, lose a lot of blood and are difficult to treat.; Anemia: frequent anal bleeding can lead to chronic anemia, a decrease in red blood cell indexes in the blood.

The patient sees that the hemorrhoid is swollen, red, and cannot be pushed in with his hand because it is very painful. This condition can lead to complications of hemorrhoid necrosis; Prolapsed hemorrhoids: hemorrhoids that protrude outside the anus and cannot be retracted can cause blockage of blood vessels.

This complication causes pain, and the condition becomes more severe when necrosis occurs.; Embolism: blood clots easily form in the blood vessels of hemorrhoids when blood circulation is stagnant. This complication causes pain, and the condition becomes more severe when necrosis occurs.\nUlcers, infections: can cause perianal dermatitis, papillitis or slit inflammation causing itching, burning pain in the anal area. Infection occurs when there is ulceration or necrosis of the hemorrhoid, causing the wound to come into contact with feces containing large amounts of germs.
