    "subsection_content": "The root cause of the disease is the immune system attacking the body's organs. In normal situations, the body responds to an infection or the presence of a foreign substance, such as bacteria, viruses or fungi, by increasing the production of special cells (white blood cells) to destroy and clean up harmful “invaders.”\nIn arthritic conditions caused by autoimmune diseases, those special cells are over-mobilized, entering the synovium and causing an inflammatory response. If this condition lasts for a long time, it leads to bone and cartilage erosion, and eventually bone deformation.\nArthritis causes swelling and pain around the joints\nAccording to Associate Professor, Dr. Dang Hong Hoa, Head of the Department of Musculoskeletal Medicine, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, some risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing arthritis due to autoimmune disease include:\nHeredity: Many studies show that the incidence of the disease in patients whose parents have the disease is 2-3 times higher than in other cases.; Pathogens: Some viruses (hepatitis B, C, Influenzae...), bacteria (Chlamydia, E.coli...); Gender: Statistics show that nearly 80% of cases are in women, of which about 2/3 are over the age of 30 and middle-aged.; Inappropriate diet and lifestyle: Unscientific diet and lifestyle do not meet the body's nutritional needs; Regular habits of smoking, alcohol, and stimulants; Work stress, staying up late... are factors that increase the risk of disease; Polluted living and working environment: Polluted environment, frequent exposure to many toxic chemicals such as pesticides, mercury, lead... can directly impact the immune system, causing changes and disorders. immune dysfunction.\nRegular alcohol and tobacco habits are one of the causes of autoimmune disease",
