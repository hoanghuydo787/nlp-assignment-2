    "subsection_content": "There are more than 80 autoimmune diseases, of which the 7 most common autoimmune arthritis are:\n1. Rheumatoid arthritis\nRheumatoid arthritis, also known as rheumatoid arthritis, is an autoimmune disease that occurs due to dysfunction of the body's immune system. The disease causes swelling and pain in many joints of the hands, wrists, elbows, knees, ankles, and feet on both sides. The disease not only destroys cells and damages joints, but also has the risk of affecting many other organs in the body such as the eyes, heart, lungs, skin and blood vessels.\nStatistics show that for every 100 people in adulthood (20 - 40 years old), 1 - 5 people have rheumatoid arthritis, the rate of the disease occurring in women is 2 - 3 times higher than in men. The disease progresses in a complicated manner, with the risk of leading to many dangerous complications, leaving many serious consequences such as limited mobility, even lifelong disability if not promptly intervened.\nRheumatoid arthritis occurs 2-3 times more often in women than in men\n2. Ankylosing spondylitis\nAnkylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory condition that occurs at the junction between the vertebrae of the spine, the lumbar spine or the patient's pelvis. In some cases, inflammation also occurred in locations such as the neck joints, wrists, ankles, etc.\nStatistics show that about 90 - 95% of ankylosing spondylitis cases occur in men, 80% in men under 30 years old. The initial symptoms of the disease are hip pain, sciatica, tendonitis, lumbar spine pain... If not treated early and properly, when the spinal joints fuse with the peripheral joints, the patient There is a risk of hunchback, loss of mobility and lifelong disability.\nAnkylosing spondylitis, if not treated promptly, can lead to permanent kyphosis\n3. Reactive arthritis\nReactive arthritis, also known as aseptic arthritis or Reiter's syndrome, is arthritis that occurs after infection or infection, usually in the urinary, digestive or genital organs. Inflammatory symptoms can appear in one or more joints, often in large joints such as the lower limbs, spine, pelvis, tendons, and ligaments.\nThe disease is common in the age group of 20 - 40 years old, common in young people and especially in men, rarely in the elderly. Most cases of reactive arthritis have a good prognosis, with patients recovering within a few weeks or months if treated promptly. However, patients are still at risk of relapse if proper post-treatment care is not taken.\nReactive arthritis often occurs in the knees, feet, heels, ankles or back and buttocks\n4. Psoriatic arthritis\nPsoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease related to psoriasis with: 10 - 30% of arthritis cases occurring in patients with psoriasis; 80% of cases appear after psoriatic lesions; 15% of cases appear at the same time as psoriasis lesions and 10% of cases appear before the initial skin lesions.\nBelonging to the group of systemic autoimmune diseases, psoriatic arthritis affects almost every organ in the body. In the musculoskeletal system, the disease causes symptoms of pain, stiffness and swelling in the joints, limiting the patient's movement and mobility. In some cases, patients experience swollen toes and fingers shaped like sausages, called Dactylitis.\nAbout 30% of arthritis cases occur in patients with psoriasis\n5. Systemic lupus erythematosus\nSystemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease that can occur in many organs in the body, including the musculoskeletal system. Some characteristics of SLE include:\nMainly seen in women, progression is different for each patient from mild to severe and complex.; The patient feels tired, loses weight, has a persistent fever that does not improve without a clear cause.; Symptoms of SLE are quite diverse. In general, patients will have rashes on the face and body, sensitivity to sunlight, joint pain, hair loss, etc.\nSystemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease characterized by rashes on the face and trunk\nSystemic lupus erythematosus is a disease caused by autoantibodies in the body, so accurately diagnosing the condition does not rely solely on clinical symptoms or serum test results alone. Diagnosis of the disease needs to be carried out at a large and reputable medical facility, directly by a team of experienced doctors with the support of modern machinery and equipment.\n6. Arthritis has symptoms of enteritis\nAbout 1% of arthritis patients have manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease, most commonly Crohn's disease arthritis and ulcerative colitis arthritis.\nThe common point of these two diseases is arthritis caused by autoimmune disease, and both include two different forms of arthritis. One is peripheral arthritis, which is inflammation of several large joints that are asymmetrical and not deformed, and the symptoms of arthritis gradually increase along with the symptoms of enteritis. The second is spondylitis, in which the symptoms of arthritis after a period of time will no longer be associated with the manifestations of enteritis.\nSome arthritis caused by autoimmune diseases have symptoms of enteritis\n7. Scleroderma\nScleroderma belongs to a group of rare autoimmune diseases, characterized by the proliferation and deposition of collagen substances in the skin, blood vessel walls and other organs in the body. Clinical manifestations include thick, hardened skin, expressionless face, Raynaud's syndrome: patients feel numbness in the fingertips when exposed to cold, hands can change color to white, red and purple, and become painful. returning to normal, ulcers, necrosis of extremities, difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, etc. Regarding the musculoskeletal system, scleroderma patients experience stiffness in the joint areas around the jaw, fingers, wrists, etc., causing difficulty moving. Muscles shorten and weaken, making it difficult to stretch.\nPeople with scleroderma may have small indented scars on the fingertips",
