On the contrary, if the test result is positive, it means the patient's antibody titer increases and the risk of autoimmune disease is high.\nHowever, using only this antinuclear antibody testing method cannot accurately determine which disease the patient is suffering from.

Step 2: Perform tests prescribed by your doctor. Most diagnostic tests for autoimmune arthritis require antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing. The patient's blood is taken intravenously and stored in a test tube containing anticoagulant, and immediately centrifuged to get serum or plasma. Then, these samples were analyzed using chemiluminescent immunoassay, enzyme and indirect fluorescence techniques. Step 3: Return results and receive consultation. The patient will be directly read the test results by a musculoskeletal specialist and advised on treatment methods, or effective disease prevention instructions.",
