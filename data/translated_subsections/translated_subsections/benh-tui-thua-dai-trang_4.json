    "subsection_content": "Doctor Kien Tam said that complications often occur when acute diverticulitis occurs. About 25% of people with acute diverticulitis develop complications. Complications of diverticula include bleeding, narrowing of the colon that makes it difficult for stool to pass, and formation of a connection to another organ or skin (called a fistula). If there is a fistula, it is usually a fistula from the colon to the bladder or it can also be a fistula from the colon to the skin, fallopian tube, vagina or another part of the intestine.\nIn addition, other complications may appear such as:\nPelvic abscess due to diverticular rupture.; Peritonitis can occur if the diverticula become severely inflamed, the diverticula ruptures, causing intestinal fluid and feces to spill into the abdominal cavity. Peritonitis often requires emergency surgery.",
