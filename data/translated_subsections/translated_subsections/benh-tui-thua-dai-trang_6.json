Diverticulitis with abscess complications can be treated with antibiotics and drainage.\nSurgery for diverticular disease is indicated in the following situations:\nRupture of diverticulitis leads to pus and feces flowing into the abdominal cavity, causing peritonitis. The disease is often severe and requires emergency surgery; Abscess drainage is not effective.; Severe cases of diverticulitis unresponsive to medical treatment; Intensive treatment is necessary in patients with immunodeficiency such as patients after organ transplantation or chemotherapy.; Diverticulitis causes colonic stricture or fistula; Patients with multiple episodes of recurrent inflammation may benefit from surgery as a strategy to prevent recurrence. The goal of surgery is to resolve the infection: diverticulectomy, colon resection, abscess drainage, abdominal washing... The current world trend is laparoscopic surgery. The outstanding advantages of laparoscopic surgery compared to open surgery are less pain, reduced wound infection rate, and faster recovery time.\nLaparoscopic surgery is a popular treatment method today\nHome care if diverticulitis\nPatients need to rest, rest, eat liquid food, and avoid strenuous exercise.
