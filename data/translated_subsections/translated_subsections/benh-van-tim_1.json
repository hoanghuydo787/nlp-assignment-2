    "subsection_content": "There are two common types of heart valve disease:\nHeart valve stenosis: This disease occurs when the heart valve does not open completely because the valve leaflets are stiff or stuck together. The narrowed gap causes the heart to have difficulty pumping blood through it, leading to heart failure and other serious complications over time. All 4 heart valves can develop valvular stenosis with names: mitral valve stenosis, tricuspid valve stenosis, pulmonary valve stenosis, aortic valve stenosis.; Heart valve regurgitation: Also known as \"heart valve regurgitation\", this is a condition in which a valve does not close tightly, causing some blood to leak back through the valve. As the leak gets worse, the heart has to work harder to compensate for the leaky valve, and less blood may flow to the rest of the body. Depending on which valve is affected, this condition is called mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary valve regurgitation, or aortic regurgitation.; Combined valve regurgitation: such as mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, etc. due to a combination of stenosis and regurgitation.",
