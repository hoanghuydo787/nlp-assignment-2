This common heart defect can prevent the mitral valve from closing tightly and lead to regurgitation.; Rheumatic heart disease: Rheumatic fever - a complication of untreated strep throat - can cause heart valve regurgitation and acute heart failure. Long-term sequelae of rheumatic heart disease can cause narrowing and regurgitation of the heart valves (rheumatic posterior valve disease).; Infectious endocarditis: Infected endocardium affects the heart valve, causing the valve to tear, perforate, or develop a growth on the heart valve that prevents the valve from opening and closing.; Myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction causes rupture of ligaments, muscle pillars or abnormal myocardial wall movement leading to mitral valve regurgitation.; Cardiomyopathy: Over time, certain conditions, such as high blood pressure, can cause the heart to work harder, gradually causing the heart's left ventricle to enlarge, stretching the tissue around the heart valves and conducting the heart. to valve regurgitation.; Injury: Experiencing a car accident, work accident... can cause heart valve leakage due to ligament rupture.; Congenital heart defects: Some babies are born with heart defects, including damaged heart valves; Radiation therapy: In rare cases, radiation therapy for cancer focused on the chest area can potentially lead to heart valve regurgitation.; Atrial fibrillation: This is a common heart rhythm disease, a potential cause of heart valve disease due to atrial dilation and valve ring dilation.",
