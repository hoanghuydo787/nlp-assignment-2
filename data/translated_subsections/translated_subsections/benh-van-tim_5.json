    "subsection_content": "When heart valves are damaged, the heart has to work harder to pump the amount of blood the body needs. At that time, the heart muscle can thicken or relax, causing the heart to enlarge. This, over time, reduces the heart's ability to contract and leads to heart failure and arrhythmia.\nReference: What is dilated cardiomyopathy?\nIn addition, the disease also causes blood to stagnate in the heart, increasing the risk of blood clots forming, causing embolism, stroke, and even death.",
