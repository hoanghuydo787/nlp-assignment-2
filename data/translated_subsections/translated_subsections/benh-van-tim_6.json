    "subsection_content": "To diagnose heart valve disease, the doctor will first do a general examination and ask about the patient's medical history and family history. A very simple method is to use a stethoscope to help detect heart murmurs. This is the sound caused by blood moving through a narrow or open hole (due to pressure differences). If heart valve disease is suspected, the doctor will prescribe the patient to perform a number of paraclinical methods such as:\nEchocardiography: This method shows moving images of the heart's valves and chambers; Cardiopulmonary X-ray: noted enlarged heart silhouette, pulmonary congestion; Electrocardiogram: can see images of dilated heart chambers, atrial fibrillation; Some other diagnostic methods include transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), stress echocardiography, CT scan of the heart and coronary arteries, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nBy periodically conducting paraclinical diagnostic methods, doctors will clearly know the progression of the disease, thereby providing appropriate treatment.\nCT scan may be indicated for patients with suspected valvular heart disease",
