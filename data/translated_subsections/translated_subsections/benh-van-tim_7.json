    "subsection_content": "Treatment of heart valve disease depends on the type and severity of the disease. There are three treatment goals including:\nProtects the valve from further damage; Alleviate symptoms; Repair or replace valve\nTreatment methods commonly applied to heart valve patients are:\n1. Use medicine\nYour doctor may prescribe medication for you to treat your symptoms and reduce your risk of further valve damage. If you undergo valve repair or valve replacement surgery, you will need long-term monitoring and medication. Commonly prescribed medications to treat heart valve disease are diuretics, antiarrhythmics, vasodilators, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, anticoagulants, etc.\n2. Heart valve dilatation procedure\nHeart valves can be repaired with percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty to widen the narrowed valve. This method is often indicated for cases of mitral valve stenosis, aortic stenosis that cannot be operated on, or pulmonary valve stenosis.\n3. Heart valve repair surgery\nHeart valve repair is a surgical procedure aimed at repairing a faulty valve without the use of artificial parts. The advantages of this approach are that the risk of infection is reduced, the need for lifelong blood thinners is reduced, and the strength of the heart muscle is preserved.\n4. Heart valve replacement surgery\nIn this surgery, the doctor will replace the artificial valve. There are two types of replacement valves: mechanical valves and biological valves.\nMechanical valve: made from artificial materials (carbon or titanium coated with pyrolytic carbon) to limit cholesterol accumulation and calcification on the surface. Its advantage is that it has a long lifespan, up to 20-30 years.\nThe disadvantage of mechanical heart valve replacement is that the patient must take anticoagulants for life to prevent blood clots from forming, causing valve jamming and stroke.\nBiological valves: made of animal tissue (pig, cow), have a shorter lifespan than biological valves (10-15 years). However, this type of valve has a great advantage, which is that most patients do not need to take anticoagulants for life, unless they have other medical conditions (such as atrial fibrillation) that require them to take medication. . Biological valves are indicated in elderly people aged 60 and over. If a biological valve is replaced in a young person, there is a risk of re-operation because biological valve degeneration occurs more quickly in young people than in the elderly.",
