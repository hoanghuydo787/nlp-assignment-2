Get regular dental check-ups every 6 months, and notify your dentist of your condition so they can take appropriate action when treating you.; Take antibiotics before any procedure that may cause bleeding, such as dental work, invasive tests (any test that involves blood or has a risk of bleeding), and most major and minor surgeries. You should consult your doctor about which antibiotic is right for you.",
