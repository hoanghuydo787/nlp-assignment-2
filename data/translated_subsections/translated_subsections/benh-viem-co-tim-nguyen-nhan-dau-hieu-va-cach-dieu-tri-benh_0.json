    "subsection_content": "Myocarditis is an inflammation of all or part of the heart muscle, which is the result of another infection, not a separate virus called myocarditis virus.\nThe disease can occur at any age but is more common in young people (20 - 40 years old), more common in men than women, and the manifestations can range from mild to severe. People with weakened immune systems, infants and young children are often at greater risk.\nMyocarditis manifests in many different degrees. In particular, the fulminant form is characterized by acute onset and severe circulatory collapse, with a very high risk of death of up to 70% if not promptly treated actively.",
