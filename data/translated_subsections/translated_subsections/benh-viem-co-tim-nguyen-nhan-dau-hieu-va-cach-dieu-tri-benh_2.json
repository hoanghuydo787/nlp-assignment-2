    "subsection_content": "Myocarditis can cause a series of serious complications for patients:\nHeart failure:\nIf not detected and treated promptly, myocarditis can quickly damage the heart muscle and lead to heart failure, causing the heart to no longer pump blood to feed the body. Myocardial infarction or stroke: Damage to the heart muscle will cause blood flowing in the heart to form blood clots and these blood clots can block one of the coronary arteries. This will lead to a heart attack. In case the blood clot in the heart moves to the artery leading to the brain, the patient will likely face a stroke.\nFast heart rate or arrhythmia:\nMyocarditis is also one of the causes of arrhythmia.\nSudden death:\nSerious arrhythmia will cause the heart to stop beating suddenly and lead to rapid death if not treated promptly. According to statistics in young people, myocarditis accounts for 20% of the causes of sudden death.\nMyocardial infarction or stroke:\nIf the heart muscle is damaged as blood flows within the heart, blood clots can form. If a blood clot blocks one of the coronary arteries, it causes a heart attack. Or if a blood clot in the heart travels to an artery leading to the brain, it can cause a stroke.",
