In addition, hepatitis B and C viruses, herpes viruses, gastrointestinal infections, mononucleosis or Rubella can also cause myocarditis.\nBacterial myocarditis:\nBacteria such as staphylococcus, streptococcus, and bacilli cause diphtheria; caused by parasites such as Trypanosoma cruzi and toxoplasma, including some species that are transmitted by insects and can cause “Chagas” disease… which are some bacteria that are believed to cause myocarditis.\nFungal myocarditis: Candida; aspergillus and certain fungi found in bird droppings, such as Histoplasma, are thought to be associated with myocarditis. People with weak immune systems who are infected with one of these fungi have a higher risk of getting sick.\nIn addition, patients who must use certain specific medications may experience drug allergic reactions or some unwanted side effects that can also cause myocarditis, such as the drugs used. for cancer treatment; antibiotics (such as penicillins and sulfonamides); some anti-epileptic drugs and some illegal substances such as cocaine.\nIn some cases, having to live in a toxic environment and being exposed to many chemicals, the risk of myocarditis is also higher than other people.\nIn autoimmune causes, the body's immune system attacks healthy heart muscle tissue, not bacteria.",
