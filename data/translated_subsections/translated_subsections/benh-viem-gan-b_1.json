    "subsection_content": "Hepatitis B is classified into two types: acute hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis B.\n1. Acute hepatitis B\nAcute hepatitis B is a short-term infection that lasts within 6 months of the patient's exposure to HBV. Most people with acute hepatitis B have no symptoms or only mild symptoms, but there are cases where the condition becomes severe and requires hospitalization for treatment.\nMany people with acute hepatitis B, especially those infected in adulthood, are able to clear the virus from their bodies through immune system activity and recover completely after several months without symptoms. any sequelae. In fact, up to 90% of adults infected with HBV recover on their own. On the contrary, if the immune system cannot eliminate the virus, acute hepatitis B will progress to chronic form.\n2. Chronic hepatitis B\nChronic hepatitis B is a liver infection that lasts 6 months or more. The HBV virus is not eliminated and continues to exist silently in the patient's blood and liver. Over time, chronic hepatitis can cause serious health problems, including hepatitis damage, liver failure, cirrhosis, liver cancer, and even death.\nDr. Thanh said, the possibility of hepatitis B progressing to chronicity depends on the age of the infected person. The younger the infected person is, the higher the chance of hepatitis developing into chronic disease. Specifically, according to WHO, up to 80–90% of infants infected in the first year of life and 30–50% of children infected before the age of 6 develop chronic liver infections. Meanwhile, this rate in adults with the disease is much lower (less than 5%).",
