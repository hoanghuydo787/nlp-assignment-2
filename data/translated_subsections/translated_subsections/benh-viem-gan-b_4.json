    "subsection_content": "Hepatitis B infection is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The main transmission routes of this virus are similar to the HIV virus, however the infectiousness of HBV is 100 times higher than HIV.\n1. Transmitted through blood\nHepatitis B virus is easily spread through blood in the following common forms:\nSharing needles, especially injecting drugs; Receiving blood transfusions or blood products containing viruses; reuse or use medical instruments that are not properly sterilized; Tattooing, piercing, manicures or performing medical or cosmetic procedures that are unhygienic and contain disease-causing viruses; Sharing personal items such as razors, toothbrushes... with an infected person.\nLet's learn about hepatitis B with MSc.BS.CKII Le Thanh Quynh Ngan\n2. Infection from mother to child\nPregnant women infected with HBV can transmit the virus to their babies. The rate of infection depends on when the mother is infected. Specifically, if a pregnant mother gets the disease in the first 3 months of pregnancy, the rate of virus infection to the baby is 1%. This rate is 10% if the mother is infected with the virus in the second 3 months of pregnancy and over 60% if the mother is infected in the last 3 months of pregnancy. The risk of transmission to the fetus can be up to 90% if there are no postnatal protection measures.\n3. Sexually transmitted\nHepatitis B can be transmitted during heterosexual or homosexual intercourse through contact with semen, vaginal fluids or blood of an infected person.\nHepatitis B is not spread through casual contact such as shaking hands, hugging, etc. The disease is also not spread through coughing, sneezing, sharing eating utensils, playing or eating food cooked by a person carrying the hepatitis B virus. .
