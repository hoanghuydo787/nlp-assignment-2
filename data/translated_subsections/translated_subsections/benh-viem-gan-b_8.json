Therefore, laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis is essential.\nThe doctor may ask the patient to conduct blood tests to diagnose hepatitis B. There are many different testing methods for hepatitis B. Among them, the most commonly ordered tests include:\nHepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): Most people with possible hepatitis B need an HBsAg test. If this test result is positive, it means the patient has been infected with hepatitis B virus. At this time, the patient will need to perform other tests to determine the virus concentration and the degree of liver damage.; Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): Most people with possible hepatitis B need an HBsAg test.
