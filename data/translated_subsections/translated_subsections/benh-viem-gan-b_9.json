Treatment of chronic hepatitis B\nMost people diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B will need lifelong treatment. Treatment helps reduce the risk of dangerous liver complications and prevents infection to others. Treatments for chronic liver infections include:\nHepatitis B virus replication inhibitors: Can help patients fight the virus and slow down its ability to damage the liver. The two basic drugs currently available are Entecavir 0.5mg, Tenofovir (including 2 types TDF300mg and TAF25mg). These drugs are used orally.; Hepatitis B virus replication inhibitors: Can help patients fight the virus and slow down its ability to damage the liver.
