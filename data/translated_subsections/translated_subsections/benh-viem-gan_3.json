    "subsection_content": "The causes of hepatitis are very diverse, can be due to viruses, alcohol abuse, drugs, fatty liver disease or genetic factors...\n1. Hepatitis due to viral infection\nThere are many types of viruses that cause hepatitis, of which the most widely known are viruses that cause types of hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, G. In addition, there are a number of other viruses such as Cytomegalovirus, Epstein barr virus, dengue virus, coronavirus 19, herpes simplex virus. Most have no obvious clinical symptoms, especially in the chronic hepatitis stage (> 6 months), patients only discover it by chance during a health check or Tests showed increased liver enzymes, then the cause was screened. In the acute phase, sometimes clinical manifestations are similar to common flu symptoms such as: mild fever, headache, muscle pain, joint fatigue, dry cough, fatigue, and loss of appetite. Typical symptoms of liver damage such as jaundice, yellow eyes, dark yellow urine, and right upper quadrant pain may occur, although not often.(5)\n2. Alcoholic hepatitis\nAlcoholic liver damage often goes through stages: simple alcoholic fatty liver, alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcoholic hepatitis and finally cirrhosis and liver cancer. This condition occurs when liver cells become necrotic due to long-term alcohol abuse. If not controlled promptly, alcoholic hepatitis develops into cirrhosis or liver cancer. Although it can cause symptoms or severe complications, even sudden liver failure, in the early stages, the disease hardly shows any special symptoms. Patients with a history of prolonged alcohol use and risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and diabetes have a higher risk of liver damage.\n3. Hepatitis due to parasitic infection\nThe malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is the most common parasite that causes hepatitis. In addition, some types of amoeba can also cause this condition.\n4. Autoimmune hepatitis\nAutoimmune hepatitis is a rare liver disease that occurs due to a disorder of the immune system. At this time, instead of attacking viruses, bacteria and other harmful agents, the immune system attacks liver cells, damaging the liver. This causes constant inflammation, affecting liver function. In the long term, the liver can be damaged to the point of stopping functioning. Autoimmune hepatitis can go away without treatment, but in most cases it is a chronic condition.",
