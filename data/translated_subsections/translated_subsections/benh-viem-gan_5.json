Clinical examination\nClinical examination is always the first step in diagnosing all forms of hepatitis. By reviewing your family and personal medical history, your doctor will be able to limit the causes and risk factors of the disease. Clinical examination helps identify typical symptoms often related to liver damage such as jaundice, yellow eyes, ascites, leg swelling...(3)\n2. Liver function test\nLiver function tests use blood samples to determine how well the liver is working. Abnormal results of these tests may be the first sign of a liver problem. High liver enzyme levels indicate that the liver is damaged or not functioning normally. At this time, the doctor may recommend that the patient perform additional blood tests to find the source of the abnormality\n3. Liver biopsy\nA biopsy is a procedure to remove a tissue sample from the liver to examine and determine the cause and extent of liver damage. It is an invasive procedure so it is usually only performed in highly specialized medical facilities.\n4. Ultrasound\nThis test allows doctors to take a closer look at the structure of the liver and nearby organs. Ultrasound images may reveal:\nIs there fluid in the peritoneal cavity? The condition of the liver parenchyma is homogeneous or not, the edges are even or not; Is there a liver tumor; Collateral circulation or not",
