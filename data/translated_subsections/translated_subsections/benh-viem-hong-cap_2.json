    "subsection_content": "Dr. Huong said that signs of acute pharyngitis usually only last 1-2 weeks.\nGeneral symptoms often include a swollen, red, itchy, burning, painful throat, possibly cough, hoarseness, fever, difficulty swallowing, and fatigue. In addition, depending on the source of the disease, symptoms may manifest differently as follows.\n1. Acute pharyngitis due to viral infection\nAdenovirus infection: Incubation period is 2-4 days. Upper respiratory tract infections often cause fever, pharyngeal congestion, and tonsil hypertrophy, along with phlegm secretions and enlarged cervical lymph nodes. When conjunctivitis occurs along with viral pharyngitis, it will cause fever-conjunctiva-throat syndrome. Sore throat can last up to 7 days and does not respond to antibiotics. Children can be reinfected many times.\nEnterovirus infection: Enteroviruses (coxsackie and echovirus) can cause a sore throat, especially in the summer. Common symptoms include high fever, congested throat; tonsillitis and cervical lymphadenitis. Symptoms will go away within a few days.\nHerpangina virus infection: Herpangina infection is characterized by gray-white, discrete, painful vesicular lesions distributed in the back of the pharynx. The blisters are 1-2mm in diameter and are initially surrounded by erythema before they ulcerate. Patients may have a high fever of 39.5°C with severe headaches and dehydration. Herpangina sore throat usually lasts less than 7 days.\nCoxsackie A16 infection: Painful, ulcerative blisters may appear throughout the oropharynx. Blisters also develop on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and less often on the trunk or extremities. Patients usually have a mild fever and the illness lasts about a week.\nHerpes simplex virus (HSV) infection: Primary infection with the Herpes simplex virus (HSV) often causes high fever accompanied by acute gingivitis, including blisters (which become ulcers) throughout the front of the mouth and lips.\nMeasles virus infection: Infants and toddlers with measles often have prominent oral manifestations in the early stages of the illness. In addition to high fever, cough, runny nose and conjunctivitis, the pharynx may be heavily and diffusely congested but the tonsils are not swollen and do not secrete fluid. On clinical examination, there is the presence of Koplik spots, white or blue-white images on the gum mucosa near the lower teeth.\nHerpes simplex virus infection leads to acute pharyngitis.\n2. Acute pharyngitis due to infection\nGroup A Streptococcus: When evaluating patients with pharyngitis, the primary concern is the accurate diagnosis and treatment of pharyngitis caused by group A streptococcus (GAS) or Streptococcus pyogenes, which accounts for approximately 15% of all episodes. throat. The sequelae of GAS pharyngitis, especially acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and acute glomerulonephritis (AGN), have at times resulted in significant morbidity and mortality in the United States and continue to do so in the United States. other places in the world. The most characteristic symptom of the disease is the sudden onset of fever and sore throat. Headache, irritability, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting also commonly occur. Besides, the patient may also have cough, conjunctivitis, sharp pain, diarrhea, scattered lesions and ulcers of the throat mucosa, and hoarseness. When examined, there is clear pharyngeal congestion, and petechiae may be noted on the roof of the mouth or in the throat, especially in the form of mononucleosis. The tonsils are enlarged, red, and have pus cavities on the surface. The papillae of the tongue may be red and swollen, and the cervical lymph nodes are often tender and swollen.\nScarlet fever: Disease caused by infection with a strain of GAS that contains a bacterium that produces an erythrotoxin (which causes redness), usually exotoxin A. The most common symptoms are a red rash that appears on the face and after 24 hours it will spread to the whole body. The rash will peel off after a few days and appear like a mild sunburn. In addition, cough, nosebleeds, conjunctivitis, laryngitis, bad breath, nasopharynx or diarrhea are manifestations of acute pharyngitis caused by scarlet fever.\nBacterial infection in mononucleosis: Acute exudative pharyngitis often occurs with mononucleosis due to primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Mononucleosis is a self-limited systemic lymphoproliferative disorder. Specific symptoms include fever, mild or severe acute pharyngitis, swollen tonsils that can cause airway obstruction, erythema, and tonsillar discharge. Neck lymph nodes may be swollen and tender.\nFusobacterium Necrophorum Infection: Fusobacterium necrophorum is an anaerobic gram-negative bacterium that is increasingly recognized as a cause of pharyngitis in adolescents and adults. This bacterial pharyngitis may be associated with the development of internal jugular thrombophlebitis, known as Lemierre syndrome. Patients have initial symptoms of fever, sore throat, exudative pharyngitis and/or retropharyngeal abscess. Symptoms persist, swelling and severe neck pain; The patient shows signs of poisoning.\nArcanobacterium infection: Arcanobacterium haemolyticum is a gram-positive bacterium that causes acute pharyngitis and a red rash. The disease is more common in adolescents with symptoms of pharyngeal congestion, white to gray tonsil secretions, cervical lymphadenitis, and mild fever. In addition, symptoms can also be petechiae on the palms and tongue; scarlet fever rash often appears on the face, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet; The red and white rash may be itchy and rarely peel.\nDiphtheria infection: Diphtheria is a very serious disease caused by infection of the oropharynx by toxic strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacteria. The incubation period is 1-5 days with symptoms of sore throat, loss of appetite, malaise and mild fever. A gray film forms within 1-2 days on the tonsils and pharyngeal walls but sometimes also appears on the larynx and trachea.\nGonococcal infection: Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection often has symptoms of purulent tonsillitis and ulceration but may be asymptomatic and then resolve spontaneously.\nHaemophilus influenzae type b bacterial infection: This is the type of bacteria that causes epiglottitis and tracheitis. The disease presents with an acute onset of fever and severe sore throat, then progresses rapidly to cause damage to the airways. Patients often salivate, stutter or have difficulty speaking.",
