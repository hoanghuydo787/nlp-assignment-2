In case after examination there is not enough basis to determine the disease, additional tests need to be done.\n1. Clinical examination\nClinical symptoms of acute pharyngitis usually last 1-2 weeks and include:\nHoarseness; Mouth sores; Conjunctivitis; Cough; Laryngitis; Lymphadenopathy\nSome viruses such as parainfluenza and influenza viruses, Rhinovirus, Coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cause distinct clinical syndromes including runny nose, cough, sore throat that can be easily diagnosed without need to do testing, specifically.\nInfluenza virus: Can cause high fever, cough, headache, irritability, muscle pain and neck lymph nodes. In young children, pneumonia or bronchiolitis may occur.\nRSV virus: RSV infection in older children is often indistinguishable from upper respiratory tract infections. In young children, bronchiolitis and pneumonia may occur. Meanwhile, sore throat is not a prominent sign of RSV infection at any age.\nParainfluenza virus: Parainfluenza virus infection can cause bronchiolitis; mild sore throat but quickly resolved. Parainfluenza virus, influenza virus and RSV infections are common during seasonal epidemics, especially in winter. Patients with obvious viral symptoms do not need to be tested for group A streptococcus. However, doctors cannot use physical examination to differentiate between viral pharyngitis and group A streptococcal pharyngitis without have viral symptoms.\n2. Paraclinical diagnosis\nRapid antigen detection test (RADT): Clinicians should use a rapid antigen detection test (RADT) to identify group A streptococcal pharyngitis. However, strep throat testing Group A bacteria are not routinely prescribed for children under 3 years of age and people with acute rheumatic fever.; Throat culture: This is the \"gold standard\" in diagnosing acute pharyngitis; Blood test: Indicated when acute pharyngitis caused by streptococcus is suspected; Computed tomography (CT): Often indicated to identify complications of retropharyngeal wall abscess due to acute pharyngitis.\nWhen symptoms of swelling and sore throat appear, patients should go to the hospital to see an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist for timely diagnosis and treatment. – Photo of Tam Anh General Hospital",
