Treatment with medication\nThe antibiotics Penicillin or Amoxicillin are indicated for patients with a positive RADT or throat culture. According to Dr. Huong, antibiotic treatment reduces the incidence of sequelae of GAS pharyngitis, such as retropharyngeal abscesses.\nDepending on the severity of the disease, the doctor may prescribe oral or intramuscular antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment also helps to resolve signs and symptoms more quickly and stops the infection within 24 hours.\n2. Surgical treatment\nSurgery is often indicated to treat complications caused by acute pharyngitis that do not respond to conventional medical treatment, such as retropharyngeal abscesses.
