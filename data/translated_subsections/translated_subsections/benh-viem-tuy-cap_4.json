    "subsection_content": "Pancreatitis can cause serious complications, including:\nKidney failure: Acute pancreatitis can cause severe kidney failure, sometimes even requiring dialysis. Lung damage: Acute pancreatitis causes biochemical changes in the body, affecting gas exchange in the lungs, causing hypoxia. Infection: a serious complication with a high mortality rate is infectious necrotizing pancreatitis Pancreatic pseudocyst: Acute pancreatitis can cause fluid and debris to accumulate in cyst-like sacs in the pancreas. A large pseudocyst that ruptures can cause complications such as bleeding and infection. Malnutrition: When inflamed, the pancreas produces less necessary enzymes. This can cause people to suffer from malnutrition, diarrhea and weight loss. Chronic pancreatitis: Repeated acute pancreatitis can lead to chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis damages the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas and can lead to diabetes or pancreatic cancer.; Kidney failure: Acute pancreatitis can cause severe kidney failure, sometimes even requiring dialysis; Lung damage: Acute pancreatitis causes biochemical changes in the body, affecting gas exchange in the lungs, causing hypoxia; Infection: a serious complication with a high mortality rate is infectious necrotizing pancreatitis; Pancreatic pseudocyst: Acute pancreatitis can cause fluid and debris to accumulate in cyst-like sacs in the pancreas.
