    "subsection_content": "1. Pain relief, fluid replacement\nThe foundation of treating acute pancreatitis is still pain relief and fluid replacement. Ringer's solution is the recommended liquid with an initial dosage of 15 mL/kg - 20 mL/kg and then 3 mL/kg per hour (usually about 250-500 mL per hour) for the first 24 hours depending on severity and associated diseases. It is necessary to closely monitor urine output, vital signs, blood urea concentration, and red blood cell volume to accurately determine the amount of fluid needed for each patient.\nActive pain relief with pain relievers such as paracetamol, NSAIDs, Opioids or even central pain relievers\n2. Feed early\nPatients need to fast within the first 12 hours of admission until abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting improve. Patients can eat again after 24-72 hours of admission with liquid, soft, low-residue, low-fat foods, depending on the severity and risk of complications.\nIn cases of severe pancreatitis or intolerance of oral intake, the patient may be fed by a nasogastric tube, or intravenously if nasogastric tube feeding is not tolerated or inadequate.\n3. Treatment with antibiotics\nFor cases of acute pancreatitis with signs of infection, patients need to be treated with antibiotics to prevent the infection from spreading.\nDr. Trung recommends that antibiotics should only be used to treat acute pancreatitis in cases where there is evidence of infection. Because \"using antibiotics if not prescribed properly, in addition to being a cost issue, can slow down and reduce the amount of fluid needed by the patient, especially in the first 24 - 48 hours after admission to the hospital.\"\nIn addition, the treatment of acute pancreatitis depends on the cause of the disease. Specifically:\nAcute pancreatitis due to gallstones: Patients should be scheduled for early cholecystectomy, even before discharge from the hospital in patients with mild acute pancreatitis due to gallstones Acute pancreatitis due to hypertriglyceridemia: Treatment will be aimed at relieving reduce and maintain triglyceride levels below 500 mg/dL.; Acute pancreatitis due to gallstones: Patients should be scheduled for early cholecystectomy, even before discharge from the hospital in patients with mild acute pancreatitis due to gallstones; Acute pancreatitis due to hypertriglyceridemia: Treatment will aim to reduce and maintain triglyceride levels below 500 mg/dL.",
