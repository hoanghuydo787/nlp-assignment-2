    "subsection_content": "1. Classification based on disease severity\n1.1 Acute sinusitis\nAcute sinusitis occurs due to an upper respiratory tract infection with cold-like symptoms (headache, runny/stuffy nose, fever, decreased olfactory sensitivity, bad breath, pain around the eyes, nose and cheeks...). There are two types of acute sinusitis: bacterial rhinosinusitis and acute viral rhinosinusitis. More common is viral nasopharyngitis. The illness usually goes away within 1 - 4 weeks. (first)\n1.2 Subacute sinusitis\nIf the above symptoms last 4 - 12 weeks, you may have entered the stage of subacute sinusitis. Compared to acute sinusitis, the symptoms of subacute sinusitis are often less severe but are considered a transitional stage between acute and chronic sinusitis.\n1.3 Chronic sinusitis\nSinusitis lasts more than 12 weeks, meaning the patient has transitioned to chronic sinusitis (chronic sinusitis). The cause can be infection, but mainly comes from nasal polyps (soft-stemmed tumors that form in the mucosa) and deviated nasal septum.\nAllergies to certain types of fungi, or fungal sinus infections, are also considered causes of chronic sinusitis. Chronic sinusitis is divided into 3 types: chronic rhinopharyngitis without polyps, chronic rhinopharyngitis with polyps and fungal allergic rhinitis. The most common is chronic nasopharyngitis without polyps. Symptoms are similar to acute sinusitis.\n1.4 Recurrent sinusitis\nA condition in which a patient experiences acute sinusitis multiple times within a year. The disease is common in people with allergies and asthma.\n2. Classification based on inflammation location\nBased on the location of the sinuses, the diseases are classified into the following:\n2.1 Maxillary sinusitis\nThe maxillary sinuses are located behind the cheekbones and are the largest paranasal sinuses of the facial sinuses. Symptoms include facial pain, swelling around the eyes and cheeks, and sometimes headaches.\n2.2 Ethmoid sinusitis\nThe ethmoid sinus is located deep in the nasal cavity, behind the face, so the symptoms of inflammation are not obvious. Patients often feel headaches in the nape area, have pus discharge, and have a prolonged cough.\n2.3 Frontal sinusitis\nLocated in the forehead, when infected or swollen, the frontal sinus will cause pain in the middle of the forehead spreading to the temples. In severe stages, pain in the eye socket appears.\n2.4 Sphenoid sinusitis\nThe sphenoid sinus is located in the body of the sphenoid bone, consisting of 6 walls: anterior wall, posterior wall, superior wall, inferior wall and two lateral walls. Symptoms of sphenoid sinusitis progress rapidly including high fever, chills, headache, neck pain, and fluid flowing down the nose and throat. Spreads quickly to both eyes and causes a very high mortality rate.\n2.5 Polysinusitis\nPolysinusitis is the process of inflammation of the mucosa of one or more sinuses at the same time due to infection from one sinus spreading to other sinuses, allergies, polluted environment, abnormal anatomical structure, decreased body resistance...",
