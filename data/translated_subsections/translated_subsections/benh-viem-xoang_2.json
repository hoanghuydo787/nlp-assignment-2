    "subsection_content": "Common causes of the disease include:\nViruses\nUsually sinus infections start with cold symptoms. Caused by a virus, which congests the nasal tissues, blocking the holes that normally drain the sinuses.\nIf it comes from this cause, all medications will not be effective, and symptoms will improve after about a week. Decongestant drops can be used but should not be used for more than 5 days to avoid developing dependence.\nThe best way to prevent viral sinusitis is similar to colds and flu, which is to get an annual flu vaccine.\nSinusitis occurs for many reasons, but mainly due to viruses\nAllergy\nStudies have shown that people with sinusitis caused by allergies (allergic sinusitis) tend to have more severe illness than patients with other factors. Therefore, if you are sensitive to pollen, pet dander, mold, perfume... stay away from these things.\nBacteria\nIf you have a cold and there are no signs of improvement after 10-15 days, the cause may be Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae. These are bacteria that are often localized in the nasopharyngeal cavity. When the body has health problems, pneumococcus will grow and cause disease. After a while, a cold will turn into sinusitis. However, the good news is: bacterial sinusitis can be prevented by vaccination.\nPolyp\nNasal polyps are small benign tumors that develop from nasal or sinus tissues, causing the sinus cavities to become blocked, preventing nasal fluid from draining and causing sinus infections. These small tumors can also restrict airways, cause headaches, and reduce the sensitivity of the sense of smell.\nSteroid nasal sprays are often used to treat sinusitis caused by polyps. If treatment is not effective, your doctor will prescribe surgery.\nAir pollution\nAlso according to Associate Professor, Dr. Le Minh Ky, polluted air contributes to nasal irritation, inflammation, and increases the risk of disease. The condition is even more severe if the patient is suffering from allergies or asthma.\nSwimming/diving in the pool for too long\nIf you are susceptible to sinus infections, you should not swim or dive in the pool for too long. Chlorine in swimming pools will irritate the nasal mucosa, cause tissue inflammation, and form sinusitis.\nHigh frequency of air travel\nThe higher you go, the lower the air pressure. This will cause pressure to build up in the head, block the airways and make sinusitis symptoms worse. To fix it, you can use nose drops or inhalers before takeoff/landing to keep the sinus area clean.\nMushroom\nSinus infections are common in people with weak immune systems, but healthy people are also at risk.\nAspergillus is a common fungus that causes sinusitis. When the immune system is weakened, fungus has the opportunity to grow, especially in moist, dark environments like the sinuses.\nMisuse of nasal sprays\nNasal sprays help clear the nasal cavity, reduce nasal congestion, but also clog blood vessels in the nose. Therefore, overusing nasal sprays can make symptoms worse, especially when not following your doctor's instructions.\nSmoke\nCigarette smoke can also irritate the nose and cause inflammation, leading to sinus infections. The reason for the inflammation is because the nose's natural sinus cleaning system has been damaged by cigarette smoke.\nCongenital abnormalities of the nose\nCongenital nasal abnormalities (such as narrow drainage passages, cleft palate, deviated nasal septum...) further promote the risk of sinus infection. Early surgical solutions will help prevent and improve sinusitis symptoms. (2)",
