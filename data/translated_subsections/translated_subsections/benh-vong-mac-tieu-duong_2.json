    "subsection_content": "Diabetic retinopathy is divided into 2 stages. (2)\nBasal (non-proliferative) retinopathy: this is the early stage of diabetic retinopathy, small blood vessels leak, causing the retina to swell, causing macular edema. This is the most common reason people with diabetes lose vision. In addition, blood vessels in the retina can narrow, causing macular ischemia, or exudates forming in the retina. These things affect the eye's vision.; Proliferative retinopathy: is a more severe stage of diabetic retinopathy. It occurs when the retina begins to grow new blood vessels. New blood vessels are often fragile and easily leak blood into the vitreous. If there is a lot of fluid leakage, it will cause blurring. New blood vessels can form scar tissue that affects the macula, leading to retinal detachment.",
