    "subsection_content": "Signs of Whitmore disease vary depending on the stage of the disease. In general, it takes 2 – 4 weeks for symptoms to appear after exposure to the bacteria. In some individual cases, symptoms occur within a few hours or sometimes years after infection. There are also a small number of people with the disease who have no symptoms.\nThe disease goes through 4 stages with the following typical signs:\n1. Local infection\nDuring this stage, the patient's skin will have red, pus-filled bumps that cause skin ulcers, pain, and are accompanied by a number of symptoms such as:\nFever; Weight loss; Stomach or chest pain; Muscle or joint pain; Headache; Convulsion\nAt the same time, ulcers also appear in many organs in the body such as the liver, lungs, spleen and prostate. Infections can even occur in joints, bones, lymph nodes or the brain.\n2. Lung infection\nOften when Whitmore bacteria enter the lungs, patients notice clear symptoms and go to the doctor. These symptoms are usually:\nCough with or without phlegm; Chest pain when breathing; High fever; Headaches and muscle aches; Weight loss\nWhen a patient has a lung infection caused by Whitmore, doctors can easily confuse it with pulmonary tuberculosis. Both diseases can lead to pneumonia, high fever, night sweats, weight loss, coughing up bloody phlegm, and the appearance of pus or blood in the lung tissues. In addition, the patient's chest X-ray also showed small spots similar to tuberculosis.\nLung infection manifested by severe coughing is the second stage of the disease\n3. Blood infection\nIf not treated quickly and properly, the patient's lung infection will progress to sepsis, also known as septic shock. This is a serious complication of Whitmore disease. When the disease is at this stage, the risk of death is very high.\nSeptic shock often progresses quickly with symptoms such as:\nHigh fever, accompanied by shivering and sweating;; Headache;; Sore throat;; Respiratory problems include difficulty breathing, respiratory failure...; Upper abdominal pain;; Diarrhea;; Joint and muscle pain;; Disorientation;; Forms pus-filled ulcers on the skin, inside the liver, spleen, muscles or prostate\nPeople who are suffering from certain chronic diseases such as diabetes, kidney failure, liver failure, thalassemia... are at high risk of developing bloodstream infections when infected with bacteria. In addition, people over 40 years old, people with chronic lung infections (such as cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis), cancer or another condition that affects immune system function Fluid also increases the risk of sepsis.\n4. Systemic infection\nWhen the disease reaches its final stage, systemic infection will occur, causing the following symptoms:\nPain or swelling in the parotid gland;; Muscle and joint pain;; Liver, lungs, spleen, lymph nodes, prostate... are damaged;; High fever;; Epilepsy, convulsions;; Ulcers or abscesses appear on the skin and throughout the body's organs. These spots start out as hard, gray or white spots, then become tender and inflamed, looking like wounds caused by flesh-eating bacteria.",
