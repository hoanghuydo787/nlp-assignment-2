Geographical location\nResidents living in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia are at the highest risk of infection with Whitmore bacteria. Specifically, the countries with the most cases of Melioidosis are Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore. The disease is also common in Vietnam, Papua New Guinea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. A few scattered cases appeared in Central America, Brazil, Peru, Mexico and Puerto Rico.

Job characteristics\nPeople who do the following jobs are likely to come into contact with bacteria that can lead to infection:\nMilitary; Construction workers working on construction sites, farmers, fishermen; Tour guides, especially those who regularly work in areas prone to epidemics\nFarmers and people who regularly work in wetlands are at high risk of Whitmore infection\n3. Chronic disease\nPeople with the following conditions are at increased risk of Whitmore disease:\nDiabetes; Chronic kidney disease; Chronic lung disease; Liver failure; Thalassemia; Cancer\nSome other diseases that contribute to this disease include heart failure, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hemangioma, chronic granulomatous disease and tuberculosis.\nPeople with diabetes are at higher risk of Whitmore infection\n4. Animals at high risk of disease\nMany animals are at risk for Melioidosis. In addition to exposure to contaminated water and soil, animals can potentially pick up bacteria from the milk, urine, feces, nasal secretions, and wounds of other infected animals.; Not only sheep, goats, and pigs (the animals most susceptible to Whitmore), the disease also occurs in horses, cats, dogs, cattle, chickens, marsupials, tropical fish, iguanas...",
