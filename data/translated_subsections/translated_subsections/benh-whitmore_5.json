Therefore, diagnosing this disease requires thoroughness, experience and high expertise. Just one wrong judgment by the doctor can cause the disease to worsen because it is not treated properly, even causing death.\nB. pseudomallei culture is considered the gold standard diagnostic test in detecting Whitmore disease. To do this, your doctor will take small samples including blood, phlegm, pus, urine, synovial fluid (found between the joints), peritoneal fluid (found in the abdominal cavity), pericardial fluid (found around the heart) of the patient (3).\nThe sample is placed in a culture medium, such as agar, to evaluate bacterial growth. After about 24 - 48 hours, the results of the culture will help the doctor determine whether the patient is infected with Whitmore bacteria.",
