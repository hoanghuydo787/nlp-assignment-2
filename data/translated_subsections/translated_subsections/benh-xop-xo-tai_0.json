    "subsection_content": "The term otosclerosis is derived from the Greek words for “hard” (scler-o) and “ear” (oto).\nOtosclerosis is an abnormal bone growth around the base of the stapes, one of the small bones of the middle ear. This leads to fixation of the stapes. The stapes must move freely for the ear to function normally and hear clearly.\nListening is a complex process. In the normal ear, sound vibrations are transmitted from the outer ear into the ear canal where they hit the eardrum. These vibrations cause movement of the eardrum, which transmits vibrations to the three small bones of the middle ear, the malleus, incus, and stapes.\nWhen the stapes moves, it causes the fluid in the ear to move, which in turn begins the process of stimulating the hair cells in the inner ear, which connect to the auditory nerve. The auditory nerve then carries sound information to the brain, resulting in hearing sounds. When any part of this process is damaged, hearing loss occurs.\nThe stapes - the smallest bone in the body - is very susceptible to damage - the cause of hearing loss. Photo: Wikipedia",
