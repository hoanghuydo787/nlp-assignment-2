    "subsection_content": "Otosclerosis most commonly occurs when one of the bones in the middle ear, the stapes, becomes stuck in place. This condition is also known as auricular bone dysplasia. When this bone cannot vibrate, sound cannot pass through the ear and hearing is impaired.\nTo date, it is unclear why this happens, but scientists think it may be related to previous measles infection. The measles virus can cause infection in patients with a genetic predisposition to otosclerosis. Immune disorders are also thought to be risk factors for the disease.\nOtosclerosis can also run in families and half of cases are hereditary. A person has a 25% risk of developing otosclerosis if one parent has the condition and a 50% risk if both parents have it.\nIn addition, the disease may also involve interactions between three different cells of the immune system called cytokines. Researchers found that a balance of these three substances helps regenerate healthy bones. Therefore, an imbalance in their levels can cause the type of abnormal regeneration that occurs in otosclerosis.\nHearing loss due to otosclerosis rarely manifests as early as age 7-8, but most cases do not become apparent until late adolescence or early adulthood when the hearing loss does not occur. Slowly progressive symmetry is diagnosed.(1)\nThe disease is common in women at twice the rate as in adult men. The age of onset of otosclerosis is from 15 to 45 years old, with an average of 33 years old.",
