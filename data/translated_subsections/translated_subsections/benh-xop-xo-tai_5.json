    "subsection_content": "Otosclerosis can be treated with the following methods:\n1. Using medicine\nCertain medications such as sodium fluoride supplements or bisphosphonates have been reported to limit the worsening of otosclerosis. However, these drugs do not have strong evidence of stopping its progression.\n2. Hearing aids\nMild otosclerosis can be treated by wearing sound-amplifying hearing aids.\nIf there are symptoms of vertigo, the patient should have a vestibular examination to treat other causes of vertigo before performing otosclerosis surgery.(4)\n3. Stapedectomy\nUnder general anesthesia, the doctor uses a microscope combined with an endoscope to make a small incision in the ear canal. This is to create a strip of the ear canal to the eardrum, dissecting and protecting the tympanic cord nerve.\nWhen the bones of the posterior wall of the ear canal are expanded, the doctor can clearly observe the ossicular structures in the middle ear and check the condition of the stapes joint with the oval window. Thanks to that, the doctor can separate the stapes bone from the oval window when cutting the entire stapes bone.\nNext, the doctor will insert the artificial material Prosthesis into the correct position to transmit sound vibrations to the inner ear, helping restore hearing. Prosthesis is an artificial bone made of titanium or fluoroplastic that has the same sound conduction function as the stapes.\nFinally, the doctor will seal the incision with the patient's ear flap cartilage and move the eardrum back to its place.\nDr. Hang and the surgical team at the Department of Ear, Nose and Throat, Tam Anh General Hospital successfully performed the surgery using endoscopic microsurgery technique.\n4. Cochlear implant\nIn advanced cases of otosclerosis, causing inner ear (sensorineural) hearing loss, stapedectomy may not be enough to restore hearing. In these situations, a cochlear implant may be considered.",
