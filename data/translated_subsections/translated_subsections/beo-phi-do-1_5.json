    "subsection_content": "Stage 1 obesity is actually very difficult to recognize with the naked eye. Furthermore, the ratio and location of excess fat distributed on the body are different according to gender. Therefore, the Ministry of Health has come up with the 3 most accurate ways to identify stage 1 obesity, which are:\n1. Calculate BMI (25 =< BMI < 30)\nBMI is calculated by dividing body weight (in kilograms) by the square of height (in meters). For example, a person who is 175cm tall and weighs 90kg will have a BMI = 90 / (1.75)2 = 29.38. Because the BMI value is 29.38 - between 25 and 29.99, this person is diagnosed with level 1 obesity.\n2. Measure waist circumference (for men: >= 90, for women: >= 80)\nMeasure waist circumference by standing straight in a natural position, feet shoulder-width apart, then slinging the tape measure across the line between the lowest rib and the upper edge of the pelvis. If the waist circumference for women is 80cm or more, or 90cm for men, this means you have stage 1 obesity.\n3. Use DXA Technology (25 =< BMI < 30)\nDXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) uses X-rays at two different energy levels to determine body fat percentage and composition. If the BMI equals or exceeds 30, it is also diagnosed as level 1 obesity.",
