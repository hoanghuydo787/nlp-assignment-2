    "subsection_content": "Because it is the mildest level of all obesity levels, level 1 obesity can be completely treated by making scientific lifestyle changes.\n1. Healthy diet\nBusy lives make many people choose pre-processed foods with quite high calorie content. This eating habit leads to increasing obesity rates. Therefore, nutrition experts give advice on building menus for effective weight loss for obese people as follows:\nDivide meals into small portions to control calorie intake.; Eat slowly, chew thoroughly; Limit junk food.; Add foods containing fiber that are beneficial for metabolism such as green vegetables and fruits.; Eat whole grain starches such as cereals, brown rice, corn,...; Minimize foods high in sugar and fat such as fast food; Do not drink alcohol or carbonated soft drinks.\nAdding lots of green vegetables to your diet helps your body control weight effectively.\n2. Exercise\nFor effective weight loss, regular exercise is a factor that cannot be ignored. Doctors recommend that you exercise 30 - 45 minutes/day and maintain it at least 5 days/week. Obese people can freely choose exercises and intensity depending on their ability. However, if you have other health problems, you need to consult your doctor to find suitable exercises. For people with stage 1 obesity who don't have enough time, you just need to try to exercise instead of just sitting in one place. Daily activities such as doing housework and going for a walk will be a good alternative.\n3. Get enough sleep\nResearch shows that sleeping less than 5 hours increases the risk of obesity 2.5 times more than normal. Lack of sleep causes the body to produce a type of  hormone that stimulates appetite, especially high-calorie foods like sweets. Getting enough sleep helps your metabolism run better, thereby controlling your weight.\n4. Drink enough water\nWater helps reduce appetite and limits cholesterol in the body to a low level. This is the ideal friend for obese people. So drink 2 liters of water every day to protect your health.\nRegular exercise helps reduce the risk of obesity.\nSee more: The connection between obesity and diabetes",
