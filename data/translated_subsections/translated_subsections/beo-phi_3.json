    "subsection_content": "There are many causes of obesity, including a combination of many direct and indirect factors: (3)\n1. Eat a lot\nDiet and lifestyle are factors that contribute to overweight and obesity. Some of the  most common causes, include:\nConsume a lot of processed foods or fast foods. This type of food contains a lot of fat and sugar, causing obesity; Alcoholic drinks such as wine often contain a lot of calories; Meals contain more energy than the body needs. This often happens when going to a buffet. Uncontrolled eating can easily lead to consuming a huge amount of calories, causing obesity.; Drinking too much sugary drinks like soft drinks and fruit juices.; Mood changes cause many people to develop eating disorders.; Nowadays, high-calorie foods have become cheaper, more convenient, and heavily advertised and promoted, making healthy eating even more difficult.\n2. Lazy exercise\nLack of physical exercise is one of the important factors leading to obesity. Many people spend most of their day doing office work. Even the habit of walking or cycling today has been replaced by the use of cars and motorbikes.\nTrends in relaxing at home such as watching TV, surfing the internet, playing computer games and less exercise increase obesity rates. If you are not active enough to burn calories, the excess energy will not be consumed but will be stored by the body as fat.\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that adults get at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week such as moderate-intensity aerobics, cycling or walking. By dividing your exercise time into small intervals, exercising becomes easier. For example, with 150 minutes you can exercise 30 minutes a day and exercise 5 days a week.\nFor those living with obesity and trying to lose weight, it is essential to  exercise more than this. Start slowly and gradually increase the number of exercises you do each week.\n3. Genetics\nGenes associated with obesity and overweight influence how the body converts food into energy and stores fat. Genes can also influence lifestyle choices. There are also some rare genetic conditions that can cause obesity such as Prader-Willi syndrome. Some genetic traits inherited from parents, such as food cravings, can make it difficult to lose weight.\n4. Endocrine obesity\nIn some cases, underlying medical conditions can contribute to weight gain, such as hypothyroidism or an endocrine and metabolic disorder (Cushing). However, if conditions like these are diagnosed and treated properly, weight loss will be easier.",
