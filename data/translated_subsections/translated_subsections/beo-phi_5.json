    "subsection_content": "Overweight and obesity can increase the risk of a number of health problems and may be associated with a number of emotional problems, as well as social relationships. Some harmful effects of obesity cause the following diseases:\n1. Causes feelings of inferiority\nOverweight and obesity are closely linked to mental health problems such as depression. People facing overweight and obesity may be subject to discrimination by others. This can lead to feelings of rejection, shame or guilt, exacerbating mental health problems. (4)\n2. Bone and joint disease\nMore than 1 in 3 obese people have arthritis. This is especially dangerous because people with joint pain are less likely to exercise. Each additional weight can put 3-4 times more pressure on the knees. They cause pain to the patient and make their movement more difficult.\n3. Diabetes\nPreviously, diabetes was common after age 40. But as the obesity epidemic takes hold, type 2 diabetes is now appearing in more young people. About 90% of people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese. In the United States, complications of diabetes cause about 200,000 deaths each year.\n4. Cardiovascular disease\nHigh blood pressure can damage the heart and arteries, and can even harm the brain, leading to problems such as dementia and stroke. Excess fat puts pressure on the heart and can lead to life-threatening problems such as blockage of the coronary arteries. The World Heart Federation says obesity increases the risk of heart disease - a serious disease that kills more than 600,000 people each year in the US.\n5. Memory loss\nBeing overweight or obese is one of the risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and dementia. A meta-analysis of 10 studies (nearly 42,000 participants followed for 3 to 36 years) found an association between BMI and Alzheimer's disease. Obese people are 42% more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease than people of normal weight.\n6. Digestive diseases\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs when the amount of stomach fluid that refluxes into the esophagus exceeds normal limits, causing symptoms with or without damage to the esophageal lining. Obesity can lead to diseases ranging from Barrett's esophagus to esophageal cancer.\n7. Endocrine disorders\nOverweight bodies are also susceptible to rashes in the folds or acanthosis nigricans, characterized by dark patches of skin in areas such as the armpits, groin and neck. Many reports have shown that insulin and c-peptide levels are higher in obese patients with acanthosis nigricans than in others.\n8. Respiratory diseases\nExcess fat prevents the chest from expanding, making breathing more difficult. Excess fat accumulated in the lung walls will also reduce oxygen exchange in the body. Obese adults with asthma are five times more likely to be hospitalized than non-obese adults with asthma.\n9. Cancer\nObesity is associated with an increased risk of developing several types of cancer, including breast, endometrial, colorectal, kidney, esophageal, pancreatic, thyroid and gallbladder cancers. There are about 85,000 new cancer cases each year caused by obesity. Rising obesity rates mean cancer cases are also increasing significantly.",
