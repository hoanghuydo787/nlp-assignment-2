Psychotherapy techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) will have a positive impact on the patient.\n2. Scientific diet\nMost people should reduce their energy intake by 600 calories per day if they want to lose 0.5 to 1 kg per week. For men this means consuming no more than 1,900 calories per day, and for women no more than 1,400 calories per day. The best way is to replace unhealthy, high-calorie foods like fast food, processed foods and sugary drinks (including alcohol) with healthy foods. A healthy diet should include:\nLots of fruits and vegetables.; Foods rich in starch such as potatoes, bread, rice, pasta, etc. (ideally whole grains and high in fiber).; Milk and dairy products; Meat, fish, eggs, beans and plant-based protein sources.; Eat less fatty foods and limit sugary drinks.\nNutrition plays an extremely important role in treating obesity.\n3.

Physical activity of 150 minutes/week will improve health and 300 to 360 minutes/week will help reduce and maintain weight. Developing a lifestyle that goes hand in hand with physical activity can help you lose weight and stay healthy.\nDepartment of Endocrinology - Diabetes, Tam Anh General Hospital will help obese patients overcome problems and improve their health status and quality of life by losing weight. A team of doctors and nurses with many years of experience and in-depth expertise will accompany the patient on their medical journey, from examination and obesity treatment regimen to the recovery and stabilization process. Join hands to improve the health and happiness of each patient's life.\nDoctors recommend that people control their weight through a healthy, balanced diet, combined with reasonable physical activity.
