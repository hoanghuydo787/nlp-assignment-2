    "subsection_content": "Silicosis is the result of lung fibrosis. The disease is common in people whose work often inhales silica-containing dust.\nSilicon is a small, crystal-like crystal found in sand, rocks, or mineral ores such as quartz (1)\nOver time, these silicon crystals will accumulate in the patient's lungs and airways. This long-term condition causes the patient to have difficulty breathing, weaken the respiratory system, and in severe cases, can die.\nExperts classify the disease into 3 types, depending on the concentration of silica dust in the air that the patient accidentally inhales: (2)\nAcute: This type of disease develops after a few weeks to several years of direct contact with silica dust. The disease progresses rapidly with the lungs becoming very inflamed and filled with fluid, causing severe difficulty breathing, causing low levels of oxygen in the blood.; Chronic: This is the most common form of chronic silicosis, occurring after a long period of time (10 - 30 years) of direct exposure to silica dust (low concentration of silica). The patient shows no signs of the disease, although the infection can be detected through X-rays. The most characteristic manifestation of this disease is that silica dust causes swelling of the lungs and lymph nodes in the chest, making it more difficult for the patient to breathe. X-ray results also showed lesions less than 10mm in diameter in the upper lung.; Progressive disease: The result of exposure to silica dust at high concentrations continuously for about 5 - 10 years. Accordingly, the patient has pneumonia and other symptoms appear more quickly than the disease at a chronic level. These patients are at increased risk of developing complex diseases in the future such as progressive massive fibrosis (PMF).\nIn addition, there is a less common type of disease, such as complicated silicosis (asthma), which leaves many scars in the lungs, along with the formation of nodules larger than 1 cm. The disease is often accompanied by progressive massive fibrosis. Smaller nodules combine to form larger inflammatory nodules. The condition can become serious if the patient has other lung diseases such as fungal infections, tuberculosis, non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections and lung cancer.\nIn addition, there are some quite common pneumoconiosis diseases such as coal lung disease (common in coal mine workers), cotton lung disease (can occur in people working in textile factories), asbestos lung disease (caused by inhalation of asbestos dust)... All have in common that they cause disease by mechanism: the patient inhales small particles of inorganic substances during work. At the same time, any disease will lead to respiratory failure if not detected and treated properly. (3)",
