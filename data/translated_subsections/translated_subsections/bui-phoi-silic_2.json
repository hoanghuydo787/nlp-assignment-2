    "subsection_content": "The disease occurs when the body reacts to the accumulation of silica dust in the lungs. When a person inhales silica dust through the nose or mouth, these crystals will act like tiny blades on the lungs, creating small cuts and scarring of lung tissue. Scarred lungs cannot open and close on their own, making it more difficult for the patient to breathe.\nPeople who regularly work in factories, quarries or ore mines are at high risk of occupational silicosis, specifically in jobs such as:\nAsphalt production; Concrete production; Glass production; Crushing or drilling rock and concrete; Mining",
