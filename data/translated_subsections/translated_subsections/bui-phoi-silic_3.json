During the exam, your doctor will ask about your breathing, both at rest and during exercise. In addition, the doctor will also ask details about your work history to determine the possibility of exposure to silica dust. You should prepare the following information before seeing the doctor:\nRespiratory-related symptoms and the time they first appeared;; What methods have you used to treat these symptoms;; The jobs you have been doing, how long they have been doing, the nature of each job...;; Substances you were exposed to at work and whether you wore protective equipment while working;; Have you been a long-time smoker;; In addition, you need to provide the doctor with old medical records, including chest X-rays, CT scans, etc.\nAfter the examination, your doctor will prescribe you some paraclinical tests if he suspects you have silicosis, including:\nLung imaging diagnosis: Chest X-ray or lung CT will help the doctor see more clearly the lung image, thereby assessing the level of lung damage as well as determining whether you are sick or not.; Lung function test: helps measure the lungs' ability to breathe properly to bring oxygen into the blood. This measurement is performed using two separate tests: spirometry and diffusion capacity. The results are also used to determine the extent of damage to your lungs.; Sputum test: Takes mucus from your throat for analysis.; Bronchoscopy: The doctor will insert a bronchoscope (a small flexible tube with a camera on the end) through the nose or mouth to the trachea and lungs. Endoscopy helps doctors see the lungs most clearly. Tissue and fluid samples may also be taken during bronchoscopy.; Surgical lung biopsy: Performed by a lower thoracic surgeon using general anesthesia. The purpose is to take a lung tissue sample for further testing.\nA chest X-ray will further strengthen your doctor's diagnosis of your condition",
