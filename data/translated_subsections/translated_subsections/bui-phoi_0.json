    "subsection_content": "Pneumoconiosis is one of a group of interstitial lung diseases caused by inhaling certain types of dust that damage the lungs. The disease is often encountered in the workplace, so it is also called occupational lung disease (2).\nThis is a condition in which dirt accumulates for many years in the lungs and progresses to disease. When a patient's lungs cannot remove all of these dust particles, it leads to pneumonia, which can cause scar tissue. The disease also damages the blood vessels and air sacs in the lungs, causing the tissues surrounding the air sacs and airways to become thicker and stiffer. This condition is called interstitial lung disease, and patients may experience more severe symptoms of difficulty breathing.",
