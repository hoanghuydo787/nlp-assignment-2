    "subsection_content": "Prof. Dr. Ngo Quy Chau said that the disease appears in many different forms, depending on the type of dust in the patient's lungs. Among them, the most common are asbestosis, silicosis and coal workers' pneumoconiosis (also known as CWP or black lung). As the name suggests, these diseases occur when people inhale asbestos fibers, silica dust and coal mine dust.\nThe disease can appear in simple or complex forms. In simple cases, small scar tissue may appear on X-ray in the form of circles and thickening, also known as nodules. In cases where the disease progresses complicatedly, causing complications and the lungs have a lot of scarring, it is called pulmonary fibrosis.\nThe disease causes scar tissue in the lungs\nNormally, when dust particles enter the lungs, it takes many years to form and develop into disease. However, in some cases the disease can progress rapidly after only a short time when the patient inhales a large amount of dust into the lungs, especially silica dust. Severe progression of the disease can lead to lung failure, deterioration of internal organs, disability and life-threatening risk.",
