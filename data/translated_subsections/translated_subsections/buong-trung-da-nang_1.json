    "subsection_content": "In some women, signs of polycystic ovary syndrome may appear very early in the first menstrual period. However, in most cases, symptoms of the disease are only discovered when they have difficulty getting pregnant. (2)\nCommon symptoms of the disease include:\n1. Irregular menstruation\nIrregular, often unusually long menstrual cycles are the most common sign of polycystic ovary syndrome. The cause is a problem with the ovulation process, causing the uterine lining to not shed every month. Besides, the uterine lining is formed and develops over a long period of time, leading to the amount of blood in each period being more than normal.\n2. Excessive hair growth (hirsutism)\nMore than 70% of women with this syndrome experience \"hairiness\" on the face, back, abdomen and chest. On the other hand, many people also experience baldness due to weak hair follicles, hair loss, thinning and thinning. Both of these phenomena stem from an increase in male hormones in the body.\n3. Obesity\nUp to 80% of women with polycystic ovary syndrome are overweight or obese.\n4. Oily facial skin, acne appears\nIncreased levels of male hormones cause the skin to secrete more oil than usual, leading to acne appearing on the face, back, chest...\n5. Skin darkening\nDark skin patches appear on the body in areas with many folds such as the neck, groin and under the breasts.\n6. Headache\nSome people may experience headaches due to hormonal changes.\n7. Mood swings\nWomen with polycystic ovary syndrome will often feel stressed and anxious. This condition can cause depression if prolonged.\n8. Pain and discomfort in the pelvic area\nWhen suffering from this syndrome, women may experience dull pain ranging from mild to severe (feeling like menstrual cramps), and feel discomfort in the abdomen, pelvis and lower back.",
