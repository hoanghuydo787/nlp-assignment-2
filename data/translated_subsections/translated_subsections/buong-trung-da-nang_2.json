    "subsection_content": "Currently, the cause of polycystic ovary syndrome has not been clearly determined (3). However, experts believe that the disease may originate from the following factors:\n1. Insulin resistance\nInsulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, responsible for converting carbohydrates and lipids into energy to help the body function. Insulin is also the only agent in the body that can reduce blood glucose levels.\nStatistics show that up to 70% of women with the disease have insulin resistance, meaning the cells inside their bodies cannot use insulin properly. At that time, blood sugar levels increase, and the body increases insulin production. Excess insulin will trigger the ovaries to increase the production of male hormones, making it difficult to ovulate.\nObesity is also one of the main causes of insulin resistance. Both obesity and insulin resistance increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.\n2. Genetics\nStudies show that certain genes are related to polycystic ovary syndrome, so if your family has a mother or sister with this syndrome, the risk of developing the disease will be higher.\n3. Diet\nThe theory is that a diet too high in starch may be a contributing factor to polycystic ovary syndrome.",
