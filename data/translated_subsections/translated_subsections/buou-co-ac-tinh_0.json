    "subsection_content": "Malignant goiter is also called thyroid cancer. Malignant goiter occurs when cells in the thyroid gland develop mutations that cause them to multiply rapidly, killing healthy cells and accumulating into tumors. The tumor can grow to invade nearby tissue and spread, metastasizing to lymph nodes in the neck, lungs, bones, liver, etc.\nGoiter in general and malignant goiter in particular are influenced by factors: geographical region, gender, and genetics. The increasing number of people with thyroid cancer being detected is partly due to advances in medicine, with modern diagnostic methods helping doctors detect the disease quickly. Sometimes the disease is discovered during routine health checks, CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasounds. If detected early, the tumor is usually small so it often responds well to treatment methods, improving life. (first)",
