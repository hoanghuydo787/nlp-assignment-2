    "subsection_content": "The incidence of malignant tumors in the neck is not high. Most cases of goiter are benign, about 5% - 15% of cases are malignant. The doctor will examine, do ultrasound, blood tests, cell aspiration, etc. to determine the type of cancer.\nDifferentiated thyroid cancer: includes types of thyroid cancer that begin in the cells that produce and store thyroid hormones. Viewed under a microscope, these thyroid cancer cells appear similar to healthy cells.\nPapillary thyroid cancer: is the most common thyroid cancer, occurring at all ages, most commonly in people between 30 and 50 years old. Most papillary thyroid cancers are small and respond well to treatment, even when the cancer cells metastasize to lymph nodes in the neck. A small number of cases of papillary thyroid cancer are aggressive and may develop to involve structures in the neck or spread to other areas of the body.\nFollicular thyroid cancer: is a rare thyroid cancer, usually affecting people over 50 years old. Follicular thyroid cancer cells usually do not metastasize to the lymph nodes in the neck. But there are still many cases where cancer cells thrive and spread to other parts of the body such as bones, lungs, etc.\nHurthle cell thyroid cancer: is a rare thyroid cancer. Rapid-cell thyroid cancer is very aggressive and can grow to structures in the neck and spread to other parts of the body.\nPoorly differentiated thyroid cancer: this rare type of thyroid cancer is more aggressive than other types of differentiated thyroid cancer and often does not respond to conventional treatments.\nNon-proliferative thyroid cancer: the disease causes many serious signs and symptoms such as: neck swelling, difficulty breathing,  difficulty swallowing. This type of cancer tends to occur in people over 60 years old. (4)",
