    "subsection_content": "Malignant goiter is determined after aspirating cells and performing a number of thyroid tests, ultrasound, MRI scan, etc. After diagnosis, the doctor will prescribe appropriate treatment methods.\n1. Test determines hormone levels in the blood\nTests that measure levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and hormones produced by the thyroid gland provide information about thyroid health. This information can be used to choose imaging tests (ultrasound or radionuclide computed tomography) to look at thyroid nodules.\nTest information for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and hormones produced by the thyroid gland is used to select imaging tests (ultrasound or radionuclide computed tomography).\n2. Antibody test\nDepending on the results of thyroid function tests, your doctor may order blood tests to detect antibodies that are associated with autoimmune disorders, such as Hashimoto's disease or Graves' disease. (5)\n3. Thyroid ultrasound\nUltrasound uses sound waves to create images of parts of the body. Through ultrasound, the doctor determines whether the thyroid nodule is solid or filled with fluid (most solid thyroid nodules are cancerous). It is also used to check the number and size of thyroid nodules and to help determine if any nearby lymph nodes are enlarged due to metastatic thyroid cancer. (6)\nFor thyroid nodules that are too small to be felt, ultrasound technology is used to guide the biopsy needle into the nodule to obtain a specimen. Even when the nodule is large enough to be felt, most doctors still use ultrasound to guide the needle.\n4. Perform thyroid scintigraphy\nThyroid scintigraphy (radiometric computed tomography) is used to determine whether a patient with a lump in the neck may have thyroid cancer. This technique is often used in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (papillary, follicular or Hürthle cell) to determine whether the tumor has metastasized or not. Thyroid scans are not used for people with medullary thyroid cancer because these cells do not absorb iodine. (7)\nA thyroid scan works best if the patient has high blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone. For patients with low thyroid-stimulating hormone, the doctor will inject thyrotropin (Thyrogen) before the scan.\n5. Thyroid biopsy\nTo determine whether a thyroid tumor or nodule is cancerous, your doctor may prescribe a fine needle aspiration (FNA). The doctor will place a thin, hollow needle directly into the nodule to draw some cells and a few drops of fluid into a syringe. The doctor also takes samples from several areas of the nodule. The biopsy samples are sent to the laboratory.\nThyroid biopsy is usually performed on thyroid nodules larger than 1cm. Doctors often use ultrasound to view the thyroid during a biopsy to ensure the sample is taken from the correct location. A thyroid biopsy is also used to sample swollen lymph nodes in the neck to check if they contain cancer cells.",
