Surgery\nSurgery is the first treatment for most types of thyroid cancer. Depending on the condition, the doctor will surgically remove all or part of the thyroid gland and nearby lymph glands. After surgery, the patient rests for a few weeks and avoids any activities that affect the neck. (8)\n2. Radioactive iodine\nA course of radioactive iodine treatment is often recommended after surgery to destroy remaining cancer cells and reduce the risk of the cancer recurring. The patient will take radioactive iodine in liquid or capsule form. The thyroid gland absorbs radioactive iodine, which destroys cells in the thyroid gland. After treatment, patients take medication to maintain stable hormone levels.\nA course of radioactive iodine treatment is often recommended after surgery to destroy remaining cancer cells and reduce the risk of the cancer recurring.\n3. Take medicine\nDuring the treatment of malignant goiter, the doctor will prescribe medications appropriate to the patient's condition to ensure health. After surgery to remove the thyroid gland, this organ will no longer produce thyroid hormones. Therefore, patients need to take thyroid hormone replacement medication for life to prevent symptoms: fatigue, weight gain, weight loss, dry skin, etc. (9)\nOccasionally, the parathyroid glands may be affected during surgery. These are glands that regulate calcium levels in the blood. Patients must supplement calcium until the parathyroid glands function normally again.\n4. When is malignant goiter surgery required?\nSurgery (incision) is the first choice when treating most types of malignant goiter. Once a malignant goiter is determined, the doctor will monitor the progression of the disease, then determine the appropriate time for surgery. The malignant goiter surgery process requires skilled, experienced doctors and modern machinery and equipment. Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City with good doctors, leading experts and modern equipment will help patients feel secure in treatment.\nSee more: Is goiter dangerous?
