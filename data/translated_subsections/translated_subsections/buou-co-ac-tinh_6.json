These are popular, convenient, and easy-to-make foods that help reduce the risk of iodine deficiency.\nSupplement marine fish (mackerel, tuna, etc.) to fully supplement the body with iodine and prevent goiter.\nFor patients with a history of thyroid diseases, after treatment, regular health checks are needed to detect the disease and treat it promptly. When there are signs of goiter (throat stuck, painful, difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, choking, shortness of breath, etc.), you should immediately go to a medical facility for examination and treatment. When a doctor diagnoses a goiter, the patient should take medicine as prescribed by the doctor, have regular check-ups and should not arbitrarily treat it with folk remedies.\nMalignant goiter is a disease with a relatively low incidence. However, do not subjectively take it lightly when the disease is still in a benign stage. You need a suitable treatment plan and prevention method to minimize the risk of malignancy.
