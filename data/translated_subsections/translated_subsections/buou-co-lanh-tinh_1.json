    "subsection_content": "There are many causes that affect the function or development of the thyroid gland leading to goiter.\nIodine deficiency: the most common cause of goiter worldwide is iodine deficiency, affecting 2.2 billion people globally. Iodine is necessary for thyroid hormone production. (2)\nIf a person does not ensure enough iodine in the diet, thyroid hormone production is reduced. At this time, the pituitary gland signals the thyroid gland to produce more hormones, affecting the thyroid structure.\nGraves' disease: an autoimmune disorder that occurs when the immune system produces a protein that mimics TSH (thyroid hormone), prompting the thyroid gland to produce too much hormone. This leads to hyperthyroidism and growth in thyroid size.; Thyroid nodules: due to uneven development of thyroid cells, forming tumors, most of which are benign. A person may have one or more thyroid nodules. The cause of thyroid nodules is unclear, but genetic factors are likely. In addition, diet and living environment also affect the formation of thyroid nodules; Pregnancy: during pregnancy, the mother's body produces gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) causing the thyroid gland to become overactive and slightly enlarged.; Thyroiditis: due to autoimmune disorders, bacterial infections, viruses or drugs that cause hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.\nBesides, risk factors leading to benign goiter include:\nWomen: more at risk of goiter or other thyroid disorders, especially women after 40 years old, during pregnancy and menopause, thyroid problems occur more often.; Family history: if someone in the family has goiter or thyroid disorder, the remaining people are at risk of goiter.; Medicines: some medical treatments (amiodarone, pacerone, lithobid...) increase the risk of benign goiter.; Radiation exposure: The risk of benign goiter increases if you have had radiation treatment to the neck or chest area.",
