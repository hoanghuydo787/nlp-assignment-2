What should you do when detecting a benign goiter?\nWhen detecting a benign goiter, the patient should see a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology - Diabetes to monitor their health. Patients should follow the doctor's instructions for effective treatment.\n2. Should simple goiter be operated on?\nThe answer is no. Simple goiter (commonly known as benign goiter) is not dangerous. People with simple goiter can still live, work, and have children normally. Goiter can be treated by using medication, taking radiation... and adjusting the diet (supplementing foods rich in iodine such as seafood, oysters, clams, using iodized salt regularly).\n3. When should goiter surgery be performed?\nSurgery is the last resort when other methods have been tried but have failed. In particular, people with large goiters often have airway problems, which can complicate surgery. The trachea may be deviated, making intubation while anesthetizing the patient more difficult. The surgical process also has many potential risks: temporary or permanent hypocalcemia due to damage to the parathyroid gland, loss of a lot of blood, affecting the vocal cords causing the patient to become hoarse, mute, scarring in the front of the neck...
