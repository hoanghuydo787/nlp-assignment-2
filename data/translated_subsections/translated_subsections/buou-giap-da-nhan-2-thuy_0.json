Multiple thyroid nodules 2 Lobed is a condition in which both lobes of the thyroid gland have nodules. This condition may or may not affect thyroid function.\nMultiple thyroid nodules include 2 types:\nMultiple 2-lobed thyroid nodules are non-toxic: thyroid nodules only change the structure of the thyroid gland and do not affect hormone production function.; Toxic 2-lobe thyroid nodules: both change structure and affect thyroid function. Together with the thyroid gland, each thyroid nodule produces hormones, causing hyperthyroidism. Toxic multiple nodules are the second most common cause of hyperthyroidism, after Graves' disease (autoimmune disorder).",
