    "subsection_content": "1. Physical examination\nWhen examined, the doctor will palpate the neck area to detect abnormalities such as tumors, cervical lymph nodes, etc. The doctor will also ask about your history of having ever had a goiter? Does anyone in your family have goiter? Have you ever had radiotherapy to the neck, head, or chest? In addition, the doctor will ask for information about: weight, hair loss, sweating, anxiety, palpitations, hand tremors...\n2. Ultrasound\nUltrasound is a commonly used method to examine the thyroid gland. Thereby, the doctor evaluates the size of the thyroid gland, the characteristics of thyroid nodules: quantity, calcification, contour, shape...\n3. Blood test\nBlood test to quantify thyroid hormones (TSH, FT3, FT4), assessing whether the thyroid gland is functioning normally. Based on the blood test results, the doctor also determined whether the 2-lobed multinodular goiter was toxic. From there, come up with a suitable treatment plan.\nMost patients with toxic bilobed multinodular goiter use radioactive iodine, except pregnant women.\n4. Biopsy\nWhen thyroid cancer is suspected, your doctor will prescribe a biopsy. The doctor uses a thin needle to poke the thyroid nodule with the help of ultrasound, takes the cells, and then sends them to the laboratory. Pathologists observe cells under a microscope. Biopsy results include the following cases:\nUnable to diagnose: due to not enough cells, need to be aspirated for re-biopsy.; Benign: most biopsy results are benign. Patients with benign results will continue to be monitored periodically every 6 months.; Malignant: the patient has cancer and needs total thyroid surgery; Indeterminate: about 15%-20% of biopsy results are indeterminate. This means that it is unlikely that these cells are cancerous, but that they are abnormal.",
