    "subsection_content": "1. Non-toxic treatment of 2-lobed multinodular thyroid gland\nNon-toxic bilobed multinodular goiter does not affect thyroid function, but patients need to be monitored periodically every 6 months or as prescribed by the doctor. Because goiter can turn toxic, causing thyroid cancer. In case of non-toxic multi-lobe goiter that is large in size and affects the breathing and swallowing process, the patient is advised to undergo enucleation surgery or use radioactive iodine. The dose of radioactive iodine is prescribed by the doctor of the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes. After using radioactive iodine, patients are susceptible to hypothyroidism, so they need to take thyroid hormone medication.\nIn addition, there is also a radiofrequency ablation method to treat 2-lobe multinodular goiter. Accordingly, the doctor uses high-frequency electric current to reduce the size of the nodules, leaving no scars, and preserving healthy thyroid tissue.\n2. Treatment of toxic 2-lobed multinodular thyroid\nToxic multinodular 2-lobed goiter will cause hyperthyroidism with symptoms: fatigue, anxiety, sweating, nervousness, palpitations, weight loss, insomnia, muscle weakness... Therefore, when detected, the person The disease needs to be treated promptly. Depending on the condition, the doctor will discuss with the patient to choose an appropriate and effective treatment plan. Treatment methods for 2-lobed multinodular goiter include: radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, and surgery.\nAntithyroid drugs: Thioamide is a group of antithyroid drugs commonly used to help thyroid function return to normal. Endocrinologists - Diabetics often use antithyroid drugs to prepare for surgery or use radioactive iodine. Patients take antithyroid medication for 2-8 weeks and stop taking medication at least 4 days before radioactive iodine treatment to avoid thyroid storm.\nAntithyroid drugs can cause side effects: fever, digestive disorders, leukopenia, liver damage... Therefore, doctors often prescribe the lowest dose of antithyroid drugs.\nThioamide is a group of antithyroid drugs commonly used to help thyroid function return to normal\nRadioactive iodine: Most patients with toxic 2-lobed multinodular goiter use radioactive iodine, except pregnant women. After treatment, if the goiter size increases or thyroid hormone levels are high, it shows that the iodine dose is not enough. Normally, iodine absorption in people with toxic multinodular thyroid goiter is worse than in people with Basedow's disease, so a higher dose of radioactive iodine is needed.\nBeta blockers: Effective in alleviating symptoms of toxic 2-lobed multinodular goiter such as tachycardia, hand tremors, sweating, nervousness, palpitations...
