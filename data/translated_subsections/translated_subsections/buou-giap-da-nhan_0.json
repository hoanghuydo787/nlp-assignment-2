Any increase in the size of all or part of the thyroid gland is called a goiter.\nMultinodular goiter (multinodular goiter) is a condition in which the goiter has many nodules (nodules). Enlarged nodules may be clearly visible or discovered incidentally during ultrasound. Multinodular goiter is associated with a higher risk of thyroid cancer. Therefore, when you have a multinodular goiter, your Endocrinologist - Diabetologist may prescribe thyroid cancer screening.\nMultinodular goiter and thyroid disease in general are more common in women than men, age > 50. Indications for treatment of multinodular goiter depend on whether the goiter causes hyperthyroidism, goiter size, and whether there is suspicion of malignancy. emptiness. In most cases, patients do not need treatment but must be periodically monitored by a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes.",
