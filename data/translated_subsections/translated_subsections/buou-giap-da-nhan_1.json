Additionally, Hashimoto's thyroiditis (autoimmune thyroiditis) is associated with a higher risk of thyroid nodules. (first)\nSupplementing foods rich in iodine helps prevent multinodular goiter.\nRisk factors for the disease include: Iodine deficiency, female gender, older age and a family with multinodular goiter. Nodules in goiter are formed and develop at different speeds, combined with factors such as medication, diet, and genes. This process takes place over many years, so it is common to notice an increase in the number of people with multinodular goiter in middle age and older.",
