    "subsection_content": "See the doctor\nIn addition to asking about medical history and family factors, observe and touch the patient's neck. Your doctor will feel the size and shape of your thyroid.\nDoctor checks patient for goiter.\nBlood tests\nBlood test to quantify thyroid hormones (TSH, FT3, FT4), thyroid antibodies (Anti TPO). Through these indicators, the doctor will evaluate thyroid activity and provide appropriate treatment plans. Even based on the blood test results, the doctor will prescribe other testing methods: neck ultrasound, CT scan, etc. to accurately diagnose the patient's condition.\nImage analysation\nUltrasound is the best method to examine the thyroid gland, helping doctors evaluate the size of the thyroid gland and the characteristics of thyroid nodules: Size, quantity, calcification, echogenicity, contour, shape, solid or cystic form. Therefore, after clinical examination and assessment, the doctor of the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes will assign the patient to have a thyroid ultrasound.\nBiopsy\nIf any nodules are suspicious for thyroid cancer, your doctor will prescribe a fine-needle aspiration biopsy. The doctor uses a very thin needle to take cells from some thyroid nodules and send them to the laboratory to have them biopsied to see if they are cancerous or not. To get accurate results, patients should be examined and biopsied at a hospital with an Endocrinology - Diabetes department with highly specialized, experienced doctors and modern equipment.\nThe Pathologist will observe the cells under a microscope. A biopsy will give 4 results:\nNon-diagnostic: Means there are not enough cells to confirm the diagnosis. In this case, a repeat biopsy will be indicated.; Benign: Most patients have benign biopsy results and continue to be monitored periodically every 6 months. Benign multinodular goiter can still be operated on if the size of the nodules is large, causing symptoms of difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, and loss of aesthetics.; Malignant: Usually papillary thyroid cancer, the patient undergoes surgery to remove the entire thyroid gland.; Unknown: Includes: Cystic lesions, cystic tumors, Hurthle cell lesions (a type of thyroid cell), atypical cells or tumors. This means that it is uncertain whether the cells are cancerous or not, but they are abnormal. Up to 15%-20% of FNA results (fine needle aspiration of thyroid cells) come back in this form.",
