    "subsection_content": "Does the treatment have side effects?\nAntithyroid drugs are often used to treat overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), toxic multinodular goiter, and hyperthyroid women during pregnancy. The drug works to block the production of thyroid hormones. It is also used for short-term treatment of hyperthyroidism in preparation for thyroid surgery or radioactive iodine.\nMild side effects: 15% of people taking antithyroid drugs have mild side effects. Both methimazole and propylthiouracil can cause itching, rash, hives, swelling and joint pain, fever, changes in appetite, nausea and vomiting. If side effects occur, the doctor may advise the patient to switch to another medication or change treatment methods. However, about half of people who have side effects with one drug will have similar side effects with the other drug.\nSevere side effects: rare, but still be careful when using antithyroid drugs, including:\nLeukocyte atrophy (granulocytes < 500/uL) is a severe decrease in the production of white blood cells. This condition is very serious but only affects 1 in 200 – 500 people taking antithyroid drugs. Older adults taking propylthiouracil and people taking high doses of methimazole are at greater risk of this side effect.\nGranulocytopenia usually occurs during the first 3 months of taking antithyroid drugs. If the patient has a sore throat, fever, or other symptoms of infection, they should stop taking the medicine and see an Endocrinologist - Diabetician for a general blood count test. Because the infection is serious, it can be life-threatening, even fatal.\nLiver damage: Rare side effects when taking antithyroid drugs, especially propylthiouracil. Liver damage associated with propylthiouracil use usually occurs within 3 months of starting the drug. If the patient has jaundice, dark urine, pale stools, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea or other symptoms of liver dysfunction, the drug should be stopped immediately. The patient goes to see an Endocrinologist - Diabetic to have liver function assessed. Liver failure associated with propylthiouracil can be severe and life-threatening.\nWhat are the long-term effects of multinodular goiter?\nMultinodular goiters are usually benign and do not cause any symptoms until they grow larger, form a lump in the front of the neck, and cause difficulty breathing and swallowing. However, even if treatment is not needed, the patient must have regular check-ups with a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes to check and consider the size of thyroid nodules and whether they are toxic or not for effective treatment and to limit the effects. to quality of life and overall health.\nIs multinodular goiter hereditary?\nMultinodular goiter can be hereditary. Evidence shows that one family member with multinodular goiter increases the likelihood of other family members having the disease. Therefore, family members who have a goiter (goiter), multinodular goiter, diffuse goiter, Basedow's goiter... should have regular health check-ups with an Endocrinologist - Diabetes doctor, thereby Detect abnormalities (if any) and choose effective treatment methods.\nMost multinodular goiters are benign and do not require treatment, but in many cases they are a risk factor for thyroid cancer. People need to have regular health checks to detect diseases. For people with multinodular goiter, it is necessary to see an Endocrinologist - Diabetes specialist at a hospital with modern machinery and equipment to get accurate test results and effective treatment.",
