The disease occurs when the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones to meet the body's metabolic needs. At this time, the thyroid gland compensates by expanding, overcoming mild thyroid hormone deficiency. (first)\nColloid goiter has a diffuse and nodular form.\nColloid goiter is also known as endemic goiter, thyroid colloid cystic goiter, simple goiter, nontoxic single-nodular goiter, nontoxic multinodular goiter or nodular hyperplastic goiter.
