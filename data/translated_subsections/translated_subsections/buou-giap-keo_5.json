    "subsection_content": "Abnormalities of the thyroid gland can be detected through medical examination (seeing, touching, listening, or some special tests), or detected early through regular health examinations. Your doctor may then use a number of tests to diagnose and evaluate goiter.\nDiagnosis of colloid goiter through tests\nDiagnostic methods include:\nThyroid ultrasound: Through this technique, the doctor can \"see\" the thyroid gland, know its size, and see whether or not colloid goiters and goiters are diffuse or nodular.; Thyroid scan: Technique that examines the size, shape and location of the thyroid gland; overactive or underactive thyroid areas; Cyst aspiration: The patient will have a fine needle biopsy (FNA) of the thyroid gland performed. The technician will take a tissue/cell sample, then examine it under a laboratory microscope. This technique is done to eliminate cancer.; Antibody test: Through a blood test, it is possible to find abnormal antibodies (a protein produced by white blood cells) that cause goiter.; Hormone testing: Looks at the amount of hormones produced by the thyroid and pituitary glands. Hormone levels that are too low or too high can also cause the disease.; Thyroid scan: A small amount of radioactive isotope is injected into a vein so that an image of the thyroid appears clearly on a computer screen. Through the images obtained, the doctor will know the size and function of the thyroid gland. However, this technique is only necessary in certain cases.",
