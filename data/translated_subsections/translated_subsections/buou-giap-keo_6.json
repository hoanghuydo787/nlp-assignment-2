The goal of treatment is to reduce the size of the goiter and maintain normal thyroid function. (3)\nSupplement iodized salt for people with acacia goiter as prescribed by the doctor to maintain a healthy thyroid\nCommon methods of treating colloid goiter are: iodine supplementation, use of thyroid hormones, and thyroid surgery. Specifically:\n1. Iodine supplementation\nApplicable to patients with colloid goiter due to iodine deficiency but thyroid function is normal. Iodine supplementation (Lugol's solution containing iodine salts) is a simple method but clearly effective in shrinking new colloid goiters. Treatment duration as prescribed by the doctor (usually 6 months or more).\nHowever, some complications of hyperthyroidism can occur when using this treatment. Therefore, patients should return for follow-up appointments or when any unusual symptoms occur. Patients need to follow the doctor's prescriptions and should not use iodine supplements to avoid overdose.\n2. Use thyroid hormone\nWhen patients have colloid goiter due to thyroid hormone deficiency and iodine deficiency, they need treatment using thyroid hormone. Medicines that patients can use include Thyroxin (Levothyroxine, L-Thyroxine, Levothyrox), Triiodothyronine (Liothyronine)... with dosage and duration as prescribed by the doctor. After a period of 8-10 months of taking the drug, the size of the goiter can be reduced by about 40-60%, and the thyroid function can function normally.\nWhile taking the drug, the patient will have periodic blood tests to measure the concentration of hormones T3, T4, FT3, FT4 and TSH to monitor treatment effectiveness, adjust drug dosage, and prevent toxicity.\nHowever, the drug is also contraindicated for people with myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, angina, hyperthyroidism, osteoporosis, etc. In addition, some side effects may occur such as nausea, increased sweating, hot flashes, weight loss, osteoporosis; Rarer conditions include insomnia, weight gain, angina, allergies...\n3. Thyroid surgery\nFor people with colloid goiter, the thyroid gland enlarges and works more than usual to compensate for the iodine/hormone deficiency. At this time, surgery can affect thyroid function. Therefore, the doctor does not prescribe surgery for the patient.\nNormally, thyroid surgery is indicated for the following cases: the patient falls into a state of choking, difficulty breathing, and hoarse speech due to pressure from the goiter; Patients with long-standing colloid goiter, risk/suspected of cancer, bleeding goiter; Enlarged goiter causing loss of aesthetics (patient wishes to have surgery).\nColloid goiter surgery is not too complicated. The patient can be discharged from the hospital after a few days if there are no complications (bleeding, infection); Hoarseness of speech (can recover after a while); hypothyroidism; Goiter recurrence (due to incomplete treatment of the cause of the goiter).\nTo get advice and book an appointment with leading endocrinology and diabetes experts at Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nTo prevent colloid goiter, make sure your diet contains enough iodine for your body. The recommended iodine intake is 150 mcg/day. The simple way is to use iodized salt in cooking; Diverse meal menu including fish, shellfish, beef, chicken, milk... Store iodized salt in a sealed jar, keep it in a cool place, avoid direct sunlight or keep it too close to the stove to ensure effectiveness. highest disease prevention results.",
