Non-toxic diffuse goiter (benign diffuse goiter)\nNon-toxic diffuse goiter is an enlarged thyroid gland without thyroid dysfunction, and can be diffuse or develop locally. If the goiter is large, it will extend into the retrosacral space. Due to limited space in the mediastinum, goiter causes compression on the upper trachea, laryngeal nerve and esophagus.\nDiffuse goiter is a condition in which the thyroid gland is enlarged on both sides\n2. Diffuse toxic goiter (also known as Basedow)\nBasedow's toxic diffuse goiter is hyperthyroidism combined with diffuse hypertrophic goiter. The disease can be caused by infection, genetics, mental trauma, etc. The basic cause of the mechanism leading to Basedow's disease is increased thyroid hormone secretion. Symptoms of Basedow's disease vary depending on age:\nIn children and adults: the thyroid gland is quite large, the clinical course has many different characteristics from adults. The patient is forgetful, has headaches, loses concentration, height is reduced, and genitals do not develop. There are also cases of children suffering from acute thyrotoxicosis. Children rarely have symptoms of heart failure, digestive disorders, etc.; In the elderly: the first symptoms of the disease are cardiovascular disorders, heart failure, precordial pain, etc. Moderately enlarged thyroid gland, mixed goiter (both diffuse and nodular), eye symptoms unclear, uncharacteristic hand tremor.\nDiagnosis of diffuse, toxic goiter requires a combination of clinical and laboratory signs. In particular, X-rays and blood tests are very important to draw conclusions about the underlying cause of the disease. After being diagnosed, based on medical records, the doctor will advise on the side effects of each treatment method for the patient to choose. (2)",
