    "subsection_content": "Abnormalities of iodine supply or metabolism always lead to goiter. Thyroid hormones are synthesized from iodine. Iodine is found in food and soil. In mountainous areas and rainy environments, iodine is washed out of the soil, leaving food with little or no iodine. This explains why residents of mountainous areas have a higher risk of goiter due to a diet low in iodine. (3)\nAbnormalities of iodine supply or metabolism are the cause of goiter.\nAlthough it is not dangerous, patients need to have regular health check-ups with a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes to detect bad developments early. Because in the long term, benign diffuse goiter has the risk of leading to hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (toxic goiter).",
