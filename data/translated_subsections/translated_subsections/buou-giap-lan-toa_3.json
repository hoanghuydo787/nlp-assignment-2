    "subsection_content": "Most diffuse goiters are benign. Small diffuse goiters often have no symptoms and do not require treatment, but must be periodically monitored by a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes.\nFor simply large diffuse goiters that compress the trachea and esophagus, causing difficulty swallowing, breathing, etc., they are treated with Levothyroxine at a dose that suppresses TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) to a low level to shrink the goiter. . If symptoms do not improve or cause cosmetic loss, the doctor may recommend surgery.\nWith toxic diffuse goiter (Basedow), patients are given antithyroid drugs (ATD): propylthiouracil, thiamazole and carbimazole; Radioactive iodine, surgery.\n1. Antithyroid drugs\nThe Thyroid Association and the American Society of Clinical Endocrinology recommend thiamazole as the preferred drug for Basedow's disease (except in patients with adverse reactions to the drug or in the first trimester of pregnancy). Thiamazole is more effective than propylthiouracil, with a longer half-life and duration of action.\nThere are two antithyroid drug regimens. First regimen: ATD dose is gradually reduced to the lowest possible dose until the desired thyroid state is achieved. Next regimen: use high doses of ATD supplemented with thyroxine (T4 – thyroid hormone) to maintain thyroid status.\nUsing antithyroid drugs is one of the methods of treating toxic diffuse goiter (Basedow).\nAntithyroid drug therapy has a 50-55% risk of disease recurrence, especially in the first year after stopping treatment. Patients are susceptible to poor prognostic factors: severe hyperthyroidism, large goiter, etc. Rare side effects of antithyroid drug therapy include: agranulocytosis, hepatotoxicity, vasculitis,… (4)\n2. Radioactive iodine\nRadioactive iodine is the most common modality used to treat toxic diffuse goiter safely and effectively; taken in liquid or capsule form. The dose of radioactive iodine is adjusted by the doctor to suit the patient based on the volume of the thyroid gland and iodine absorption, etc. The patient must stop all iodine-containing medications and foods. Use an iodine-restricted diet to ensure effective absorption of radioactive iodine. If the patient has previously taken antithyroid drugs, when using radioactive iodine, the antithyroid drug must be stopped. After 1 week, you can use it again.\nSide effects of radioactive iodine therapy include: hypothyroidism, exacerbation of thyroid eye disease. Therefore, after using radioactive iodine, the patient must be monitored by a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology - Diabetes to control hypothyroidism and promptly treated with thyroid hormone medication.\nNote: Patients who are pregnant, breast-feeding, and have uncontrolled severe thyrotoxicosis... should not use this method.\n3. Surgery\nThyroid surgery is the most successful treatment for toxic diffuse goiter. Even removing the entire thyroid gland is more successful. However, besides the side effects of hypothyroidism, surgery has many other potential risks: laryngeal nerve paralysis leading to hoarseness, muteness, surgical scars, etc. Therefore, surgery is often indicated last. when the methods of using antithyroid drugs and radioactive iodine are not effective.",
