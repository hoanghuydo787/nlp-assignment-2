Control the amount of iodine in your daily diet\nDiet and nutrients play a very important role in preventing diffuse goiter as well as many other diseases: diabetes, cardiovascular disease, blood pressure, kidney disease, etc. To prevent goiter, besides Balanced nutrition, patients need to supplement adequate iodine in accordance with the body's needs. According to WHO recommendations, iodine intake depends on age and physical condition. Specifically:\nAge group Iodine requirement (mcg/day) Age group Iodine requirement (mcg/day) Infants (Months old) 0-5 90 Adult males (Over 19 years old) 150 6-11 90 Children (Five years old) 1-6 90 Adult female (Over 19 years old) 150 7/9 120 Adolescent male (Years old) 10-12 120 Pregnant woman (During period) 200 13-18 150 Female adolescent (Years age 10-12 120 Breastfeeding mother (During period) 200 13-18 150\nThe easiest way to supplement your body with enough iodine is to use iodized salt in your daily diet. It is necessary to distinguish between sea salt and iodized salt. 100 grams of sea salt only contains 20 mcg of iodine, so it does not meet the body's need for iodine. Meanwhile, 1 gram of iodized salt contains about 45 mcg of iodine. With 1 teaspoon of salt, about 5.69g, more than 220 mcg of iodine is added.\n2. Nutrition for people with diffuse goiter\nFor people with diffuse goiter, it is not toxic\nFor people with non-toxic diffuse goiter, the patient should eat a lot of vegetables, providing enough iodine for the body: seaweed, seafood, fish, dark green vegetables, carrots, sweet potatoes, fruits. trees (oranges, tangerines, etc.). Limit your intake of processed foods.\nFor people with toxic diffuse goiter\nPeople with toxic diffuse goiter should eat foods rich in protein, zinc, calcium, vitamin A, vitamin E, etc. to avoid weakness and health deterioration. When choosing foods, choose foods with a low glycemic index (below 55). Some suggested foods: lean pork, brown rice, whole grains, cauliflower, kale, cabbage, radishes, amaranth, carrots, bananas, kiwi, oranges, apples, carrots, Papaya, mango,... Do not eat red meat (beef, buffalo meat, lamb,...), milk and dairy products (cheese, yogurt, whey,...), sugar and foods high in sugar (cakes, carbonated drinks,...), spicy, hot spices, stimulants, alcoholic drinks.\nAlthough diffuse goiter is a benign disease, there are also many cases of toxicity. Therefore, when there are signs of diffuse goiter, the patient needs to see a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology - Diabetes to monitor, promptly detect dangerous complications and plan appropriate treatment. .",
