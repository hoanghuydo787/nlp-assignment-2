    "subsection_content": "The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped endocrine gland about 5cm long located under the neck, with a weight of 10-20 grams. The thyroid gland has 2 lobes: left lobe and right lobe. The thyroid gland plays an important role in the body, responsible for releasing hormones that control metabolism. Hormones secreted by the thyroid gland regulate many body functions including: heart rate, breathing, body temperature, nervous system function. (first)\nRight lobe goiter is a goiter located in the right lobe of the thyroid gland, with one or more enlarged nodules. Right lobe goiter is quite common, with up to ⅓ of women and ⅕ of men affected. This tumor is usually benign, less than 5% of cancer cases (2). Therefore, testing is needed to determine whether thyroid nodules are malignant or not.\nWhen the thyroid gland is damaged, it will affect the organs in the body. However, if you have a right lobe goiter, the thyroid gland can still continue to function well and produce enough hormones for the body. In fact, most cases of right lobe goiter do not affect health much. However, this could be a sign of thyroid disease.\nWomen have a higher risk of right lobe goiter than men.",
