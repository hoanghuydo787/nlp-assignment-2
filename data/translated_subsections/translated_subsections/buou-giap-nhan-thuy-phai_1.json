    "subsection_content": "The majority of cases of right lobe goiter are due to the following problems: (3)\nIneffective thyroid hormone production: when the thyroid gland cannot produce enough thyroid hormone, it compensates by enlarging. A common cause of ineffective thyroid function is iodine deficiency. Some other causes include: radiation exposure, genetics...; Thyroiditis: Thyroiditis causes swelling of the thyroid gland, creating large, tumor-like nodules in the neck. The common cause of thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which occurs when the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, causing inflammation. Children with Hashimoto's thyroiditis have a higher risk of right lobe goiter. In addition, another common cause is postpartum thyroiditis, about 5% of women have postpartum thyroiditis. Some cases of thyroiditis are caused by side effects of medication.; Thyroid tumors: Thyroid tumors are usually benign but can be cancerous. Most tumors are enlarged nodules, which may appear as generalized glandular swelling.; Iodine deficiency: Iodine plays a role in helping the thyroid gland produce thyroid hormones. Iodine deficiency in the diet is the main cause of goiter and right lobe goiter.",
