    "subsection_content": "When right lobe goiter is suspected, the doctor will check by looking or touching the thyroid gland. When a nodule is discovered, the immediate question is: is the thyroid nodule benign or malignant? Do nodules produce too much thyroid hormone? Is it related to the cervical lymph nodes? To solve the above problems, the doctor will prescribe the patient the following diagnoses: (5)\nUltrasound: helps the doctor determine the location and characteristics of thyroid nodules. Ultrasound of lymph nodes in the neck to determine whether there is cancer or not; Blood test: measures hormone levels T3 and T4 (thyroid hormones) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Blood tests help determine whether thyroid nodules are producing too much thyroid hormone, which can cause hyperthyroidism.; Biopsy: depends on the size of the nodule and the characteristics of shape, border, and density. A fine needle biopsy (FNA) may be performed. Use a small needle to take a sample of cells or fluid from the nodule. Then, examine under a microscope to determine whether the nodule is benign or malignant.",
