    "subsection_content": "Right lobe goiter is divided into 3 types for treatment: benign goiter, malignant goiter, and right lobe goiter that secretes too much hormone. (6) (7) (8)\nTreatment of benign goiter: most patients with benign right lobe goiter do not need specific treatment. The doctor will prescribe medication to prevent the growth or reduce the size of the nodules. Benign right lobe goiter is indicated for removal when the patient has the following factors: male under 40 years old, has had head or neck radiation therapy, has enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, has problems with speaking and swallowing, and has a history of Someone in the family has thyroid cancer. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is often used for benign tumors. Radiofrequency ablation uses a probe to reach the tumor, then treats it with electric current and heat to shrink the tumor.; Treatment of malignant goiter: For people with malignant right lobe goiter, the entire thyroid gland needs to be removed. The lymph nodes in the neck are examined to determine whether the tumor has spread or not. Further treatment depends on the findings at surgery. Some patients can have thyroid hormones placed and monitor blood tests and ultrasounds. While other cases will receive radioactive iodine to destroy remaining thyroid tissue, followed by blood tests and ultrasound.; Treatment of thyroid nodules that secrete too much hormone: treated in many ways including radioactive iodine, removing nodules with alcohol or surgical excision. Radioactive iodine taken in pill form causes the thyroid gland to shrink making less thyroid hormone. Radioactive iodine is absorbed only by the thyroid gland, so it does not harm other cells. Alcohol thyroidectomy involves injecting alcohol into the thyroid nodules through a small needle, causing the nodules to shrink and produce less thyroid hormone.\nGet your thyroid checked regularly.",
