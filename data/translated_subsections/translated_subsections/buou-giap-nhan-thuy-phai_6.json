    "subsection_content": "People with right lobe goiter who are being treated with medication or have had surgery need to have regular check-ups as prescribed by their doctor. For benign tumors that do not require surgery, long-term monitoring is required. If the tumor does not increase in size, monitoring is required for 3 - 5 years. For patients after thyroidectomy, it is necessary to monitor and strictly follow the doctor's instructions regarding medication, diet, exercise regimen, and periodic follow-up visits.\nAlthough right lobe goiter does not affect health much, 5% of cases still have malignant goiter. Therefore, if there are signs of abnormalities in the thyroid gland, you need to see an Endocrinologist for timely examination and detection. Early treatment of right lobe goiter helps prevent dangerous complications.",
