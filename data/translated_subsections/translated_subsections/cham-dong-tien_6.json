    "subsection_content": "To diagnose nummular eczema, your doctor will examine the bumps or patches on your skin. The doctor examines the skin using experience and in-depth knowledge along with supporting tools such as lamps and magnifying glasses. The patient is then examined for fungi to determine whether the nodules are caused by bacteria or fungi.\nFor an accurate diagnosis, a skin biopsy is needed, but this is not necessary because it will leave scars on the skin. If bacteria and yeast are not detected, the patient is diagnosed with nummular eczema and has an appropriate treatment regimen.",
