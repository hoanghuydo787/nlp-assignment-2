    "subsection_content": "Classified by severity\nThe severity of a traumatic brain injury is determined by a number of different factors, such as whether the patient has lost consciousness or memory, neurological symptoms occurring at the time of injury, Abnormalities detected on head CT scan or brain MRI results...\nMild traumatic brain injury: Mild traumatic brain injury is quite common. According to some statistics, out of every 4 cases of traumatic brain injury, 3 cases are mild cases. People with mild injuries may feel dizzy, lose consciousness for about 30 minutes or have symptoms of confusion for about 1 day.; Moderate traumatic brain injury: This type of traumatic brain injury can result in loss of consciousness for more than 30 minutes but usually not more than a day. However, patients may experience cognitive decline and confusion lasting up to a week.; Severe traumatic brain injury: People with severe traumatic brain injury may be unconscious for more than a day, causing many dangerous complications. If not treated promptly, serious traumatic brain injury can lead to death.\nClassification according to pathological characteristics\nIn addition to classifying traumatic brain injuries according to severity, another way of classifying is based on pathological characteristics. Accordingly, it can be divided into types of traumatic brain injury:\nUncomplicated traumatic brain injury: Results of CT/MRI scan of the brain and head are normal, whether the patient has mild, moderate or severe traumatic brain injury.; Complicated traumatic brain injury: The results of a head CT scan or brain MRI show changes in the brain area, such as bleeding.; Closed traumatic brain injury: Most cases of traumatic brain injury are closed injuries, meaning an external force acts on the skull but does not penetrate the skull.; Open traumatic brain injury: An open traumatic brain injury is when a bullet, knife, fragment or other object penetrates the skull. If a foreign object enters the brain, it will directly damage brain tissue.; Traumatic brain injury due to lack of brain oxygen: This traumatic brain injury is often not caused by trauma but is the result of stroke, seizures, drowning, suffocation, etc., which deprive the brain of oxygen.\nTraumatic brain injury is classified according to the level of injury or pathological characteristics",
