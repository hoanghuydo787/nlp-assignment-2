The greater the impact force, the more serious the injury.\nCommon causes of traumatic brain injury include:\nFalls: Falls (falling down stairs, falling from bed, falling in the bathtub, etc.) are the most common cause of traumatic brain injury.

Researchers believe that pressure waves passing through the brain significantly disrupt brain function.\nFalls are a common cause of traumatic brain injury\nIn addition, traumatic brain injury is also the result of the head hitting objects after a fall or after a fire or explosion, debris being pinned directly to the head, etc.",
