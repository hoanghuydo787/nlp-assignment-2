    "subsection_content": "Traumatic brain injury can leave many dangerous complications. Some complications can occur immediately or within hours after a traumatic brain injury. In particular, the more severe the injury, the greater the risk of serious complications.\nSome complications of traumatic brain injury can include:\nComa unconsciousness, not aware of anything and unable to respond to any stimuli.; Falling into a vegetative state, no longer able to perceive while still maintaining blood pressure, breathing rate and cardiovascular functions.; State of minimal consciousness, severely altered consciousness but still showing some signs of awareness of self or environment.; Brain death, loss of brain and brain stem function. Brain death is considered an irreversible complication of traumatic brain injury.; Convulsions are also a complication of traumatic brain injury. Seizures may occur only in the early stages, or many years after the injury.; Hydrocephalus, where there is an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain causing swelling in the brain.; Infection of the meninges (meningitis) caused by a skull fracture or penetrating wound that tears the meninges surrounding the brain, allowing bacteria to enter the brain and cause infection.; Frequent headaches, which usually begin within a week of the injury and can last up to several months.; Dizziness, lightheadedness, and tinnitus are also complications after traumatic brain injury.; Paralysis of facial muscles or loss of feeling in the face; Loss or change in sense of smell or taste; Loss of vision or double vision, visual impairment; Tinnitus, hearing loss.; Changes in thinking (cognitive) skills, more difficulty concentrating and taking more time to process thoughts in the mind such as making arguments, opinions, decisions, etc.; Having problems with language and communication (inability to organize thoughts and ideas, difficulty speaking or writing, not understanding what people around you are saying, etc.); causes frustration, conflict, and misunderstanding for the person with a traumatic brain injury, as well as family members, friends, and caregivers.; Changes in behavior and emotions, irritability and anger, high risk of depression; Degenerative brain disease caused by repeated traumatic brain injury or severe trauma. Degenerative brain diseases can lead to dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, etc.",
