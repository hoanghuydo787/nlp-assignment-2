CT scans are often used to diagnose traumatic brain injury. Meanwhile, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not commonly used for acute head trauma because performing an MRI scan takes more time than a CT scan, making it difficult to transport a severely injured patient from the room. emergency room to the MRI machine. However, once the patient is stable, an MRI scan can assist in detecting lesions not detected by a CT scan.; Neurological assessment test: Use the Glasgow Scale (GCS) to evaluate the patient's coma and impaired consciousness. Perform tests on the patient's memory, thinking, motor functions (balance, reflexes and coordination) and sensory functions (hearing and vision).\nCT and MRI images help doctors assess the location and extent of the patient's injury",
