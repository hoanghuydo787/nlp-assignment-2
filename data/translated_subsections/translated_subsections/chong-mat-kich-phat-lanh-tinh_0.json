    "subsection_content": "To be able to understand exactly what benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is, you can start by analyzing each word in the name of this disease. Accordingly:\n“Dizziness” describes the feeling that everything is spinning, unable to maintain balance and unable to position in space.; “Postural” refers to the fact that dizziness only occurs when there is a sudden change in posture that causes the head position to change or move.; “Paroxysmal” is a word used to refer to this dizziness condition that only appears suddenly in a short time, when you change position, without warning signs.; “Benign” helps you understand that the disease is not life-threatening.\nSpecifically, benign paroxysmal vertigo is a disorder of the vestibular system. Benign paroxysmal vertigo develops when calcium carbonate particles (otoconia), also known as auditory canal stones, move and get stuck in the semicircular canal (the vestibular organ in the inner ear that plays a role in keeping the body balanced). ). When you change your head position, these stones enter one of the three semicircular canals, stimulating the vestibular system. When stimulated, the vestibular system sends signals to the brain and triggers dizziness.\nThis condition causes sudden dizziness when you change the position of your head, typically dizziness when lying down or dizziness when suddenly moving from standing to sitting, tilting your head to one side, etc.\nBenign paroxysmal vertigo is a disease with low risk. Dizziness attacks can range from mild to severe but have the common characteristic of only lasting a few minutes and not lasting too long. Some cases can go away on their own after a few weeks without treatment. If the disease recurs again, you should seek medical assistance for support, because although the disease rarely causes complications, dizziness can cause you to fall, leading to injury.\nBenign paroxysmal vertigo is quite common. Some statistics show that about 20% of the population suffers from this condition. (first)\nAbout 20% of the population has experienced benign paroxysmal vertigo",
