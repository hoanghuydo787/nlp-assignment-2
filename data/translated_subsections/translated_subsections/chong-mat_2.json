Currently, vertigo is divided into 3 groups of causes: peripheral vertigo, central vertigo and combined causes. (2)\nCauses of peripheral vertigo\nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV): The disease occurs when small calcium particles move out of place in the semicircular canals of the inner ear, also known as ectopic stones in the ear. Although benign paroxysmal positional vertigo can cause discomfort, it is rarely serious, except for injuries caused by falls.
