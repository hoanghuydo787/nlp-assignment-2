    "subsection_content": "Prolonged dizziness can affect your health and reduce your ability to work. There are only some symptoms of dizziness that can go away on their own as the body adapts and do not require treatment. If the dizziness is long-term, accompanied by signs such as vomiting, difficulty breathing, fever, or numbness in the limbs, the person with dizziness needs to go to a medical facility for examination and treatment. To treat a patient's vertigo, doctors base on determining the cause to have a reasonable treatment plan. Most dizziness symptoms are treated with medication or balance exercises, surgery... (3)\nVestibular rehabilitation combined with the ICS Impulse system: Your doctor will prescribe physical therapy exercises to train your senses to compensate for vertigo. This remedy is recommended if you experience recurring dizziness. From there, vestibular rehabilitation works by helping the brain adjust its response to changes in the vestibular system. This therapy helps train your eyes and senses so you can learn how to adapt and be most useful when your body begins to have symptoms of dizziness. Currently, Tam Anh General Hospital applies vestibular rehabilitation exercise therapy combining the ICS Impulse system for the first time in Vietnam with BPPV treatment methods for a success rate of 80-90%.\nAmerican Natus vestibular monitor at Tam Anh General Hospital\nOtolith repositioning procedure: The American Academy of Neurology has produced a series of detailed head and body movement guidelines for patients with BPPV. The movements are performed to move calcium stones from the ear canal into the inner ear cavity to be absorbed by the body. Patients will be instructed to perform the safest and most effective movements such as the Epley test, Semont, and BBQ Roll. These exercises can cause more dizziness if you do them yourself or do them incorrectly, so you need to practice under the guidance of a doctor at the hospital and then practice at home.; Otolith repositioning procedure: The American Academy of Neurology has produced a series of detailed head and body movement guidelines for patients with BPPV.

If dizziness is caused by infection or inflammation, antibiotics to treat the infection or anti-inflammatory drugs can help reduce swelling. Anti-anxiety medications such as: Diazepam, Alprazolam Anti-nausea and allergy medications Diuretics: Your doctor may prescribe diuretics if you have headaches due to Meniere's disease.

If vertigo is caused by a more serious underlying problem, such as a tumor or injury to the brain or neck, your doctor will focus on treating the root cause to control the vertigo. There are 3 surgical options including: Endolymphatic sac decompression surgery, 8th vestibular nerve resection surgery, and labyrinthectomy surgery. Endolymphatic sac decompression surgery: This surgery can help relieve vertigo by reducing fluid production or increasing fluid absorption in the inner ear. When decompressing the endolymphatic sac, a portion of bone is removed from the sac. Vestibular nerve resection surgery: The patient will have the nerve that connects the sense of balance and movement of the inner ear with the brain while still retaining hearing function. Labyrinthectomy: The patient will have the balance portion of the inner ear removed, eliminating both balance and hearing functions. This surgery will cause loss of hearing function, so it is only applicable to patients with complete hearing loss.; Endolymphatic sac decompression surgery: This surgery can help relieve vertigo by reducing fluid production or increasing fluid absorption in the inner ear.
