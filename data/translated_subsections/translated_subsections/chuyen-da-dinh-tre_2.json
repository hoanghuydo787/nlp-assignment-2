However, based on the manifestations, it can be divided into 2 main causes: (2)\nDue to the pregnant mother's constitution\nThe mother's body may have some defects in the pelvis such as an overall narrow, flat, transversely narrow, and distorted skeleton. Pregnant mothers with ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids in the anterior position, pelvic tumors, and double uterus are also factors that affect the journey of labor.\nDue to abnormal fetal position\nThe stage of labor can be affected by fetal position. Abnormal crowns have large crown diameters: horizontal, forehead, face. The head position is not good if the head is bowed, the position is bad like posterior occiput or transverse occiput. The umbilical cord is short, the fetus is large (over 3500 grams).",
