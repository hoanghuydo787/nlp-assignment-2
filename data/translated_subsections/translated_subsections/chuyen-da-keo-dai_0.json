    "subsection_content": "Labor is a physiological process in which the fruits of conception including the fetus, amniotic membrane, umbilical cord and placenta are expelled out of the uterus. The process of labor is achieved through changes with the gradual opening and dilation of the cervix under the influence of rhythmic uterine contractions of sufficient frequency, intensity and duration.\nFor women giving birth to their first child, the average labor time is 12 - 18 hours. In pregnant women giving birth, the labor time is shorter, on average from 8 to 12 hours. Prolonged labor is when labor lasts longer than 24 hours.\nCharacteristics of true labor contractions to distinguish them from false contractions - Braxton Hicks are as follows:\nRegular, painful contractions;; Contractions have gradually shorter intervals;; Contractions increase in intensity and duration;; There is a relationship between the intensity of contractions and pain;; The contraction causes the cervix to open;; Fetal position down;\nWomen are diagnosed with labor when they have the following signs:\nIntermittent abdominal pain;; Pink vaginal discharge;; Labor contractions;; Removal of cervical opening;; Establishment of the amnion.\nLabor is a normal physiological process in pregnant women to prepare for the \"labor\" process.\nNormal labor is divided into 3 stages:\nStage 1: Open the cervix\nIn the latent stage, the cervix opens 3-4 centimeters and dilates, contractions become more frequent (usually 5 to 20 minutes apart).\nUterine contractions appear naturally without the mother's will. Uterine contractions cause pain. Depending on the pain threshold of each pregnant woman, some people will feel less or more pain. When the contraction pressure reaches 25-30 mmHg, the pregnant woman begins to feel pain. At this stage, pain often appears late, after uterine contractions and disappears before uterine contractions end.\nThe doctor will determine cervical dilation through a vaginal examination (internal examination). This is the longest and least intense stage of labor. Pregnant women are often hospitalized during this period. Some pregnant women may not realize they are in labor if their contractions are light and irregular.\nNext comes the active phase, signaled by dilation of the cervix from 4 to 7 cm. Contractions become longer, more painful, and more frequent (usually 2 to 4 minutes apart).\nThe transition occurs when the cervix dilates from 8 to 10 cm. Contractions are often cyclical and regular, gradually getting faster and longer, lasting only 15 to 20 seconds at the beginning of labor, then reaching 30 to 40 seconds at the end of the cervical dilation phase. The intensity of uterine contractions also gradually increases. Contractions pressure at the beginning of labor ranges from 30-35 mmHg, gradually increasing to 60-90 mmHg.\nStage 2: Delivery of the fetus\nThe second stage of labor begins when the cervix is ​​fully dilated and ends with the birth of the baby. In the second stage, the pregnant mother tries to push the baby out through the vagina. The second stage is shorter than the first stage and can take from 30 minutes to 2 hours (average is 50 minutes) if the mother is giving birth to a nulliparous child (first time). This time will be shortened to 15 minutes to 1 hour (average 20 minutes) if the mother gives birth to a baby.\nStage 3: Vegetable book\nAfter giving birth to the baby, the woman enters the third and final stage of labor: delivery of the placenta. This stage usually lasts only a few minutes to 30 minutes  and involves the passage of the placenta out of the uterus and through the vagina.\nEvery labor experience is different and the amount of time spent in each stage will vary. However, labor for the first birth usually lasts about 12 to 14 hours, shorter for subsequent births.",
