    "subsection_content": "A pregnant woman who has been in labor for more than 18 hours or has been to the obstetrics facility for more than 12 hours without giving birth should be considered immediately. The doctor will consider based on signs such as:\nDoes the mother experience dehydration or acidosis?; Is there an infection (fever)?; Is there anemia?; Is there psychological trauma?; Having problems with contractions?; Is there a problem with the fetus?; Is there a problem from the pregnant woman, such as a comorbidity?; Check to see if your water has broken?; What is the degree of effacement and density of the cervix?; Constipated or a full bladder?\nAfter determining the cause of prolonged labor, depending on each case, the doctor will choose the appropriate treatment method. (3)\n1. Use Oxytocin\nIf a woman has a prolonged period of active labor, doctors sometimes give Oxytocin. This is a synthetic hormone used to induce labor, strengthen and regulate uterine contractions. If used properly, Oxytocin can speed up the labor process, and is relatively effective in treating cases of prolonged labor. Depending on the clinical situation of each pregnant woman, the doctor will carefully review it before prescribing Oxytocin.\n2. Amniotic rupture or amniotic rupture\nAmniocentesis or amniotomy  is a procedure in which a doctor breaks a woman's membranes with a finger or a special instrument to speed up labor. When combined with Oxytocin,  amniocentesis or amniocentesis can help induce or enhance labor.\n3. Assisted birth using suction cups or forceps\nThese are tools used to support vaginal birth during the delivery period when the mother pushes weakly or the mother has an accompanying medical condition. If used properly, these tools can help shorten the delivery period. If used incorrectly and incorrectly, it can cause trauma to the mother's genital tract and trauma to the baby. To limit complications for mother and baby, suction cups and forceps are only used when prescribed to shorten the labor process.\n4. Caesarean section\nIf labor is prolonged by unsuccessful oxytocin-corrected uterine contractions, a cesarean section should be performed.",
