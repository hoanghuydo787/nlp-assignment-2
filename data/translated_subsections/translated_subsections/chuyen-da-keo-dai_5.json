Perinatal mortality can be twice as high if labor lasts more than 24 hours. The cause of death was pneumonia (following infection from the uterine cavity), asphyxiation, and postpartum trauma.\nThe most common cause of brain damage leading to cerebral palsy is lack of oxygen supply to the fetus or newborn, also known as birth asphyxia. The longer the baby is deprived of oxygen, the more severe the damage can be. Causes of birth asphyxia are related to prolonged labor: hemorrhage, difficult birth due to large fetus, amniotic infection...\nDoctors will rely on the Apgar index to quickly assess the child's health status after birth. This index is assessed at one minute and five minutes immediately after birth to determine the baby's health status including checking heart rate, muscle tone, reflexes, breathing rate and skin color.\nProlonged labor is a problem that pregnant mothers may  encounter when giving birth. However, with intensive care monitoring and treatment from doctors and midwives, possible complications can be limited.",
