According to research, vitamin D, Calcium and Phosphorus are the main components involved in the bone formation process. In particular, vitamin D plays a role in helping the body absorb Calcium and Phosphorus. When the body lacks vitamin D, the levels of Calcium and Phosphorus in the blood decrease, the body can take these nutrients from the bones to serve life activities.\nAt the same time, up to 80% of the actual amount of vitamin D provided to the body comes from sunlight and only 20% comes from daily foods (meat, fish, eggs, milk, oil, beans,... ). Therefore, children can suffer from rickets due to vitamin D deficiency if they are covered too closely and are not exposed to much sunlight.
