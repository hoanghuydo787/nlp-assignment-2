They come and go, can get weaker or stronger, not in any cycle, usually occurring when entering the second or third trimester.\nInitially, false labor \"visited\" infrequently, only occurring a few times a day. As you enter your third trimester and get closer to your due date, false contractions may occur multiple times per hour, for many hours at a time.
