    "subsection_content": "The exact cause of false labor contractions is unknown. However, researchers believe that some activities of pregnant women can cause stress to the baby in the womb. Contractions occur to help increase blood flow to the placenta, while providing the baby with more oxygen.\nSpecific causes of Braxton Hicks contractions include:\nDehydration: Pregnant women need 2 – 3 liters of water every day. Not drinking enough water can cause false labor to appear more frequently.; Overexertion: False labor is at risk of appearing at the end of the day if you have to stand for too long during the day or exercise too hard.; Sexual activity: When you orgasm, your body produces a hormone called oxytocin. This hormone causes muscles, such as the uterus, to contract. In addition, semen containing prostaglandin is also capable of causing uterine contractions; Full bladder: A full bladder will put pressure on the uterus, causing uterine contractions or cramps.",
