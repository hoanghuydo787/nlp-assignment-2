    "subsection_content": "The phenomenon of false labor is completely NORMAL and not dangerous. Therefore, you do not need to see a doctor if you experience false labor contractions.

Therefore, if you see contractions accompanied by the following signs, you need to go to the hospital immediately:\nVaginal bleeding; Rupture of amniotic membranes; The fetus does not move or moves less than 8 times in 2 hours; Pain spreading to the lower back and abdomen, increasing day by day; The contractions become increasingly stronger and longer lasting; Changing positions does not help relieve contractions; Shortness of breath or chest pain; You're approaching your due date and contractions are coming closer and closer together.",
