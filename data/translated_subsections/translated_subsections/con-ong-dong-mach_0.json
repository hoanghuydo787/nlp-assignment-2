    "subsection_content": "Patent ductus arteriosus is a condition in which blood flows directly from the aorta through the pulmonary artery, leading to increased blood flow into the pulmonary circulatory system, increasing the amount of blood returning to the left heart. If a large ductus arteriosus remains, the pressure in the pulmonary blood vessels also increases. As a result, babies are at risk of heart failure when they are only a few weeks old. (2)\nChildren with small patent ductus arteriosus often do not have symptoms but may have infective endocarditis. Surgery may be necessary if a large patent ductus arteriosus is present. However, in most cases, the ductus arteriosus is closed using devices or coils through cardiac catheters.",
