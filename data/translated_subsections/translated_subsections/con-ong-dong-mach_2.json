    "subsection_content": "Researchers don't know exactly why patent ductus arteriosus occurs. Before birth, the fetus has an opening that connects two major blood vessels leading from the heart – the aorta and pulmonary artery. This opening is necessary for the baby's blood circulation, helping the baby receive oxygen from the mother's circulation. (3)\nAfter birth, the ductus arteriosus usually closes within 2 or 3 days. In premature babies, this process takes more days. If after this time the opening remains open (patent ductus arteriosus), too much blood will flow to the baby's lungs and heart. If the disease is not treated promptly, blood pressure in the child's lungs will increase (pulmonary hypertension), and the heart will enlarge and weaken.\nCauses of patent ductus arteriosus include:\nPremature birth: Patent ductus arteriosus is more common in premature babies. The reason is that the lungs of premature babies often do not receive enough lubricants (surfactants), leading to the development of respiratory distress syndrome in newborns - a breathing problem that also develops PDA.; Family history and other genetic conditions: Children with a family history of heart defects or other genetic conditions, such as Down syndrome, are at increased risk of PDA.; Mother infected with rubella during pregnancy: If the mother contracts rubella during pregnancy, the risk of heart defects in the child will increase. The rubella virus crosses the placenta and spreads through the baby's circulatory system, damaging blood vessels and organs, including the heart.",
