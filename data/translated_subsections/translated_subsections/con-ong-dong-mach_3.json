    "subsection_content": "Doctors can hear the murmur of a heart with a patent ductus arteriosus when examining a baby's health at birth. If you suspect your child has this disease, the doctor will prescribe the following paraclinical tests:\nEchocardiogram: gives clear images of the heart, helps doctors determine PDA, see if the heart chambers are enlarged, and evaluate how well the heart is pumping blood. This test also helps doctors evaluate the heart valves and detect other potential heart defects.; Chest X-ray: X-ray images will reveal the condition of the child's heart and lungs. At the same time, X-rays can also detect diseases other than heart defects.; Electrocardiogram: This method records the electrical activity of the heart, helping doctors diagnose heart defects or heart rhythm problems.\nCurrently, thanks to modern machinery systems and experienced echocardiography experts, we can detect heart abnormalities in children in the fetus, helping to promptly handle them right after the child is born. At Tam Anh General Hospital, pregnant women have a fetal echocardiogram from the 18th week of pregnancy. This helps with prenatal diagnosis and screening, detection of congenital heart disease in the womb, close monitoring and early intervention immediately after birth.",
