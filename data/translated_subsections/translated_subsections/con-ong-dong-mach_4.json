    "subsection_content": "A small ductus arteriosus can close on its own without causing complications. On the contrary, large ductus arteriosus that is not treated promptly can lead to:\nPulmonary hypertension: Too much blood circulating through the heart's major arteries increases the risk of pulmonary hypertension, causing permanent lung damage. A large ductus arteriosus is the cause of Eisenmenger syndrome, a type of irreversible pulmonary hypertension; Heart failure: A patent ductus arteriosus weakens the heart muscle, making the heart unable to pump blood effectively - a sign of heart failure.; Heart infection (endocarditis): Children with structural heart problems, such as patent ductus arteriosus, are at higher risk of developing endocarditis than children with healthy hearts.",
