    "subsection_content": "Treatment for patent ductus arteriosus depends on the severity of the disease and the patient's age. (4)\nIn premature babies, the PDA often closes on its own. The doctor will monitor your baby's heart to make sure open blood vessels are closing properly. For full-term babies, small PDA usually does not cause other health problems. Therefore, this case does not require treatment but only close monitoring.\nMedications: For premature babies with PDA, the doctor may prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or indomethacin, to help the stoma close on its own. These drugs have no effect on patent ductus arteriosus in full-term neonates, children, and adults.; Percutaneous closure of the ductus arteriosus: Premature babies are often too small to be eligible for this procedure. Therefore, if the child does not experience complications related to PDA, the doctor will advise waiting until the baby is older before intervention to close the ductus arteriosus. In this procedure, a thin catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and threaded to the child's heart. Through the catheter, a device (coil, amplatzer...) is inserted to close the ductus arteriosus.; Surgery: If medication is not effective and the child's condition is not suitable for percutaneous closure of the ductus arteriosus, the doctor will prescribe surgery to tie the ductus arteriosus with sutures or clips. It usually takes several weeks for a child to fully recover from surgery. Sometimes, surgical ligation of the ductus arteriosus is also recommended for adults with PDA causing health problems when the anatomy of the ductus arteriosus is not suitable for percutaneous closure of the ductus arteriosus.\nDoctors at Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City perform surgery to treat congenital heart disease for children",
