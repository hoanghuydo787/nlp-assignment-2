Types of specimens taken for testing include venous blood, nose/throat fluid, bronchial aspirate, lung biopsy samples, bronchus or post-mortem lung tissue.\nCurrent popular methods include: (3)\nRT-PCR technique (molecular genetic technique); Sequencing technique (determining the nucleotide sequence); HI technique (technique to prevent hemagglutination); ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent) technique; Virus isolation techniques; Micronutrient neutralization technique\nInfluenza A H5N1 was detected through clinical diagnostic tests",
