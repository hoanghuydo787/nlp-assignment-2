In all cases, the antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is often used because it has the ability to help reduce the severity of the disease, thereby reducing the risk of death. If Tamiflu is not available or does not respond, zanamivir (Relenza) can be used to treat H5N1 in humans.\nWith symptoms such as high fever, cough with phlegm, joint pain, etc., the patient will take additional medications as prescribed by the doctor such as fever reducers, anti-inflammatory corticosteroids, and antibiotics.\nTo the extent that the disease can be treated at home, some of the actions below will help patients shorten the duration of infection.\nTake plenty of time to rest; Live in a well-ventilated environment, the room temperature is not too hot or cold, limit air-conditioned rooms; Pay attention to hygiene and disinfect your throat with diluted salt water several times a day; Should be combined with nasal spray to limit respiratory infections; Eat cooked food and drink boiled food, prioritize foods/dishes that are easy to digest, rich in nutrients, and drink plenty of water.",
