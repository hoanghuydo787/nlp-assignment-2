    "subsection_content": "Joint stiffness is a condition in which it is difficult to move the joints, often appearing in the proximal knuckles, metacarpals, wrists, elbows, knees, ankles, and toes (both sides). (first)\nThis phenomenon can occur in any subject. Initially, the joints are mildly stiff, causing little serious impact on motor function. Over time, symptoms become more severe and can leave the patient unable to move the affected limb.\nJoint stiffness often occurs in the morning after waking up or after a prolonged immobile position. After the patient flexes and stretches, the joints will move more easily or almost normally (doctors often called signs of joint rust destruction), \"joint rust destruction time\" usually takes about 15-20 minutes to 1 hour or even more than 1 hour.\nSigns of stiff joints often come with joint pain, which can cause difficulty in living and performing tasks that require joint movement. In the long term, this condition is a sign of joint damage, reduced motor function and possible disability.\nTherefore, understanding this condition is essential for patients to see a doctor early, detect chronic joint diseases if any, and treat them promptly, preventing possible medical complications.",
