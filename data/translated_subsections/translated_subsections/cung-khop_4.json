This will help the doctor determine the cause of the disease and consider performing some other tests to accurately diagnose the condition.; Blood test: This test will help your doctor check for joint stiffness. Blood tests will check erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ERS), C-reactive protein (CRP) to determine inflammation in the body. When rheumatoid arthritis is suspected, the doctor may order the patient to undergo an anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) test to confirm the diagnosis.; Imaging tests: The results of X-ray, ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will help the doctor examine the structures inside the joint and identify joint damage.",
