    "subsection_content": "Loss of mobility\nJoint stiffness often occurs in areas where the joint moves frequently. If it appears in the hands, the patient will be affected by the ability to grasp and carry. If there is stiffness in the legs, walking will be very difficult.\nMost patients cannot move flexibly, and symptoms recur when moving the damaged joint area. People with long-term illnesses and people with underlying rheumatoid arthritis are likely to have permanent effects on their ability to work.\nJoint and muscle atrophy, deformity and disability\nJoint stiffness can completely cause disability if not treated promptly and properly. If a joint does not move for a long time, blood circulation will be limited, leading to muscle atrophy, joint deformity and joint adhesion. In the late stages without treatment, the patient has a very high risk of disability.\nAffects the heart\nCardiovascular diseases are serious complications of joint stiffness. This symptom, when not treated promptly, can cause heart damage. In particular, complications of heart valve regurgitation often appear when the disease progresses to a late stage. For elderly patients, heart complications can be fatal and are very difficult to prevent.",
