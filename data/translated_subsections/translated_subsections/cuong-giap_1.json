    "subsection_content": "The main causes of hyperthyroidism include: (2)\nBasedow's Disease (Graves' Disease)\nThe most common cause accounts for more than 70% of cases. This disease occurs because autoantibodies in the blood activate the thyroid gland, causing it to grow and secrete too much thyroid hormone. This type of hyperthyroidism tends to run in families and usually occurs in young women between the ages of 20-50 years old.\nThyroid nodules are overactive\nThyroid nodules are lumps in your thyroid gland. Thyroid nodules are common and usually benign, with only a very small percentage containing cancer cells. However, one or more thyroid nodules may become overactive and produce too much thyroid hormone. This often appears in older people.\nThyroiditis\nThis is a condition in which inflammation of the thyroid gland destroys the normal structure of the thyroid follicles, leading to stored thyroid hormones leaking out of the thyroid gland. Hyperthyroidism can last up to 3 months, after which the histological structure of the thyroid gland returns to normal. Your thyroid can become underactive, a condition called hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism usually lasts 12-18 months, but the condition can be permanent.\nSome types of thyroiditis can cause overactivity in the thyroid gland and then cause hypothyroidism:\nSubacute thyroiditis: Usually occurs in women aged 30-50. The disease often occurs a few weeks after viral infection with swelling, pain in the neck and symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The cause of subacute thyroiditis is unknown, but the condition may be related to a viral or bacterial infection.; Postpartum thyroiditis: This type of thyroiditis develops within 1 year after a woman gives birth.; Silent thyroiditis: This type of thyroiditis develops silently because it does not cause pain, although the thyroid gland may become enlarged.\nIncrease iodine consumption\nThe thyroid uses iodine to make thyroid hormones. The amount of iodine you consume affects the amount of thyroid hormone your thyroid makes. In some people, consuming large amounts of iodine can cause the thyroid gland to make too much thyroid hormone. Some medications may contain high amounts of iodine, for example the heart medication amiodarone. Seaweed and seaweed supplements are also high in iodine. (3)\nUsing too much thyroid hormone medication\nSome people taking thyroid hormone medications to treat hypothyroidism may overdose. If you take thyroid hormone medication, you should see your doctor at least once a year to have your thyroid hormone levels checked. You may need to adjust your dose if your thyroid hormone levels are too high.\nSome other medications can also interact with thyroid hormone medications to raise hormone levels. If you take thyroid hormone medications, ask your doctor about interactions when starting a new medication.",
