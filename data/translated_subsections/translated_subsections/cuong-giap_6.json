    "subsection_content": "There are 3 methods of treating hyperthyroidism: medical treatment with medication, radiation therapy with oral radioactive iodine, or surgical treatment with thyroid surgery. The goal of treatment is to return thyroid hormone levels to normal to prevent long-term health problems and reduce unpleasant symptoms caused by increased thyroid hormones in the blood.\nTreatment depends on the cause of your hyperthyroidism and its severity. When recommending a treatment, your doctor will consider your age, potential allergies or medication side effects, other conditions such as pregnancy or heart disease, and whether you have access to a surgeon. Thyroid experienced or not. (5)\nDrug treatment\nBeta blockers: Beta blockers will not stop the thyroid from producing hormones but may help reduce symptoms until other treatments take effect. Beta blockers work quickly to relieve many symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as tremors, heart palpitations, and anxiety. Most people feel better within a few hours of taking a beta blocker; Antithyroid medications: The antithyroid medication methimazole (Thyrozol®) or, in rare cases, propylthiouracil (PTU) may be prescribed if your doctor chooses to treat hyperthyroidism by blocking the gland's ability to make new hormones. armor. Methimazole is currently preferred due to fewer serious side effects. These medications control overactive thyroid well and do not cause permanent damage to the thyroid gland.\nIn about 20% to 30% of patients with Basedow's disease, treatment with antithyroid drugs for 18-24 months can result in sustained remission. For patients with toxic nodular or multiple nodular goiter, antithyroid drugs are sometimes used in preparation for surgical or radioiodine treatment.\nAntithyroid drugs cause allergic reactions in about 5% of patients who use them. Common minor reactions are red rash, hives, possibly fever and joint pain. Less common (occurs in 1/500 patients), but more serious is decreased white blood cell count. Such a decrease may decrease your ability to fight infection.\nIf you are taking one of these medicines and have a fever or sore throat, you should stop taking the medicine immediately and have a blood test check your white blood cell count that day. Even if the medication has lowered your white blood cell count, the white blood cell count will return to normal if the antithyroid medication is stopped immediately. But if you continue taking one of these antithyroid drugs despite a low white blood cell count, there's a risk of more serious, even life-threatening infections.\nLiver damage is another extremely rare side effect. Using PTU can cause a serious liver problem, which is why this medication is not usually prescribed. You should stop methimazole or PTU and call your doctor if you have yellowing eyes, dark urine, severe fatigue, or stomach pain.\nRadiation therapy\nAnother way to treat an overactive thyroid is to damage or destroy the thyroid cells that make thyroid hormones. Because these thyroid cells need iodine to make thyroid hormone, they will absorb any form of iodine in your blood, whether the iodine is radioactive or not.\nThe radioactive iodine used in this treatment is taken orally, usually in a small, one-time capsule. Once in the body, radioactive iodine enters your bloodstream and is quickly absorbed by overactive thyroid cells. Radioactive material that is not absorbed by thyroid cells will be excreted from the body through sweat, urine, and feces over a period of days to weeks. Radioactive iodine destroys absorbed thyroid cells.\nAs a result, the thyroid gland or thyroid nodule shrinks in size, and thyroid hormone levels in the blood return to normal. Sometimes patients still have hyperthyroidism, but usually to a milder degree than before.\nRadioactive iodine has been used to treat patients for more than 60 years and has been proven to be safe. Importantly, there was no apparent increase in cancer in hyperthyroidism patients treated with radioactive iodine. As a result, in the United States more than 70% of adults who develop the disease are treated with radioactive iodine. More and more children over the age of 5 are also being safely treated with radioactive drugs.\nAlmost all people treated with radioactive iodine later develop hypothyroidism because the cells that produce thyroid hormones have been destroyed. However, compared to hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism is easier to treat and less likely to cause long-term health problems. People with hypothyroidism can completely control their condition with daily thyroid hormone medication. Doctors do not use radiation therapy in women who plan to become or are pregnant or in women who are breastfeeding. Radioactive iodine can harm an unborn baby's thyroid gland and can pass from mother to baby in breast milk.\nThyroid surgery\nYour hyperthyroidism can be permanently cured by surgically removing all or most of your thyroid. This surgery is best performed by a doctor experienced in thyroid surgery. Once your thyroid is removed, the source of your disease is gone and you will likely become hypothyroid. Just as hypothyroidism develops after radiation therapy, your thyroid hormone levels can be restored to normal by once-daily treatment with thyroid hormone supplements.\nSee more: Can hyperthyroidism be cured?",
