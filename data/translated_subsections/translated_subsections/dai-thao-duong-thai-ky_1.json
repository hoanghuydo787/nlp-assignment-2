    "subsection_content": "When we eat, the body breaks down carbohydrates from food into a type of sugar called glucose. This sugar enters the bloodstream, then travels to cells to provide the body with energy. An organ called the pancreas makes a hormone called insulin, which helps transport sugar into cells and lowers blood sugar levels. (2)\nDuring pregnancy, the placenta - the organ that nourishes and provides oxygen to the baby - secretes hormones to help the fetus develop. Some of these hormones make it harder for a pregnant woman's body to produce or use insulin (also called insulin resistance).\nTo keep blood sugar levels stable, a pregnant woman's pancreas must make more insulin - three times more than normal. In cases where the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin, the pregnant woman's blood sugar level will increase, causing gestational diabetes.\nYour risk of diabetes during pregnancy increases if:\nBeing overweight - obese before pregnancy;; Gaining weight very quickly during pregnancy;; Having a relative (parent, sibling) with type 2 diabetes;; Have high blood sugar levels, but not enough to be diagnosed with diabetes. This phenomenon is called prediabetes;; Have a history of illness in a previous pregnancy;; Over 35 years old;; Have given birth to one or more babies weighing more than 4kg;; Have had a stillbirth, given birth to a child with a birth defect, or had a premature birth;; Have or have had polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\nBeing overweight before pregnancy increases the risk of gestational diabetes",
