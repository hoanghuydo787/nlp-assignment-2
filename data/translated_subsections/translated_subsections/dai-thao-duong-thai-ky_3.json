    "subsection_content": "Not only does it affect the health of pregnant women, diabetes during pregnancy also poses some potential risks to the baby such as: (3)\nExcessive growth and large fetus: Higher than normal blood sugar levels in the mother cause the fetus to grow too quickly, leading to a large birth weight (usually over 4kg). A fetus that is too large will easily experience injury during birth or be unable to give birth normally.; Premature birth: High blood sugar increases the risk of premature labor and giving birth before the pregnant woman's due date. Or pregnant women are advised to give birth early because the baby is too big; Severe breathing difficulties: Premature babies born to mothers with the condition are at risk of respiratory distress syndrome – a condition that causes difficulty breathing.; Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia): Sometimes, a baby born to a mother with gestational diabetes will experience low blood sugar soon after birth. Not only that, severe hypoglycemia episodes can also cause seizures in your baby. It is necessary to feed the baby immediately or give the solution intravenously to bring the baby's blood sugar back to normal.; Birth defects.; Death immediately after birth; Increased red blood cells, neonatal jaundice; Risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in adulthood.; Stillbirth: Gestational diabetes, if not well controlled, can cause the fetus to die before or shortly after birth.\nMeanwhile, for pregnant women with diabetes during pregnancy, health complications that may occur are:\nHypertension during pregnancy and preeclampsia: These are two serious complications of pregnancy, which can threaten the lives of both mother and child.; Caesarean section: Because the baby is too big to be born naturally, you will likely have to have a cesarean section if you have gestational diabetes.; Increased risk of premature birth.; Increased risk of spontaneous abortion; Increased risk of urinary tract infections; Having diabetes in the future: You are at risk of having this condition again in your next pregnancy. Not only that, you are also at risk of developing type 2 diabetes when you get older.",
