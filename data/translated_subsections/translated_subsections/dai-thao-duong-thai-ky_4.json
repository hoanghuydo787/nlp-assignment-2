    "subsection_content": "If you are diagnosed with gestational diabetes, you need to control your blood sugar and maintain it at a safe level to protect your health and that of your fetus (4). To do this, you need to make some lifestyle changes, such as:\nFollow a diet that is beneficial for people with diabetes\nThis diet must meet two requirements: maintain blood sugar levels within safe limits, but still provide enough calories and nutrients for fetal development.\nBesides, you should maintain a reasonable weight and avoid gaining too much weight during pregnancy by consuming enough calories, from 2,200 - 2,500/day if you have average weight. If you are overweight, this number will drop to about 1,800 calories/day.\nPregnant mothers need to pay attention to their diet to prevent diabetes\nBesides, the nutritionist will guide you on how to balance your diet. Specifically:\n10 – 20% of calories come from protein sources (animal and vegetable); Less than 30% of calories come from unsaturated fats; Less than 10% of calories come from saturated fat; The remaining 40% of calories come from carbohydrates\nExercise more\nIf both you and your baby are in good health, your doctor may recommend that you exercise more. This will help your body produce and use insulin more effectively, thereby better controlling blood sugar levels. Try to do light to moderate exercise for 15 – 30 minutes, most days of the week. If you're unclear about which exercises are right for you, ask an expert.\nCheck blood sugar levels\nYou will be instructed how to check your blood sugar regularly, 1-2 hours before and after meals. This is to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment process and see if your body responds well to the doctor's regimen.\nTake medicines\nIf your blood sugar remains high even though you have changed your lifestyle and diet according to your doctor's instructions, you will be prescribed diabetes medication to control blood sugar and protect your fetus. Insulin injection is also a considered therapy.\nChart the development of the fetus\nTo minimize complications for mother and baby caused by gestational diabetes, the doctor will closely monitor the baby's size during the last weeks of pregnancy. If the fetus grows too large, you may be recommended to terminate the pregnancy earlier than the due date (with the condition that the pregnancy is 37 weeks or more).\nAfter you have safely given birth, your doctor will check to make sure your blood sugar levels have returned to normal. Next, you need to recheck your blood sugar after 4-12 weeks after giving birth and periodically every year.\nDoes gestational diabetes go away on its own after giving birth?\nMost women's blood sugar levels drop after they give birth and hormone levels return to normal. However, about 50% of women who have diabetes during pregnancy will develop type 2 diabetes in the future. Proper diet and exercise can help reduce this risk. Your doctor may recommend that you have a blood sugar test 4 – 12 weeks after giving birth to monitor the possibility of developing diabetes.",
