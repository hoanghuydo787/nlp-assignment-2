Therefore, when taking care of pregnant women with diabetes, special attention should be paid to their daily menu, to ensure that the amount of carbohydrates, proteins and fats absorbed into the body is within allowable limits.\nCarbohydrates (sugars)\nUsing carbohydrate-rich foods appropriately will help prevent spikes in blood sugar levels. Healthy carbohydrate options include: whole grains, brown rice, sweet potatoes, legumes (peas, lentils, soybeans), starchy vegetables, low-sugar fruits, etc.\nProtein\nPregnant women should increase their intake of protein-rich foods so that the fetus has enough nutrients to develop and at the same time stabilize blood sugar levels. Good sources of protein are lean meat, poultry, fish, eggs, soy products (tofu, tofu, soybeans...).\nBeneficial fats\nHealthy fats, especially omega-3, are not only good for fetal brain development but also help prevent the risk of diabetes, preeclampsia, premature birth, and cardiovascular disease for the mother. Foods rich in healthy fats include fatty fish (tuna, salmon, herring...), unsalted nuts, olive oil, avocado...\nVitamins and minerals\nSome micronutrients such as calcium, iron, folic acid, zinc, vitamin A, vitamin D, B vitamins... help strengthen the immune system, ensuring mothers a healthy pregnancy. Calcium is found in seafood, eggs, and dairy products; Iron is found in beef, pork, dark green vegetables, almonds, walnuts; Zinc is found in seafood, beef, eggs, beans, spinach; Yellow fruits and vegetables such as papaya, carrots... are rich sources of vitamin A...\nBesides following a nutritious menu, pregnant mothers should divide their meals into small portions, eating every 2 hours to control blood sugar levels.",
