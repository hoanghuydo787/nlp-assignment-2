    "subsection_content": "Diabetes has 2 main types:\n1. Type 1 diabetes\nType 1 diabetes is a disease caused by the destruction of the beta cells of the pancreas, causing reduced insulin secretion or no insulin secretion, causing very little insulin circulating in the blood, unable to regulate blood sugar levels, causing danger to the patient. patient's life.\nMost type 1 diabetes occurs in children and young people (most commonly under 20 years old), accounting for about 5 - 10% of all diabetes cases. In this form, the symptoms of the disease occur suddenly and progress rapidly, so the disease can be easily detected.\nType 1 diabetes can occur in children and young adults\n2. Type 2 diabetes\nDifferent from type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes was previously called diabetes of the elderly or non-insulin-dependent diabetes. In this form of the disease, insulin secreted by the pancreas, although reaching the same amount as normal people, is reduced, or has no role in regulating blood sugar levels due to progressive reduction in the function of pancreatic beta cells on a background. insulin resistance.\nThis is the most common form of the disease, most common in people over 40 years old and tends to gradually rejuvenate. The number of patients with this type accounts for 90 - 95% of the total number of cases. The disease has no clear symptoms, so it is difficult for patients to detect.\nIn addition to the two main types above, diabetes also has another type of disease that only occurs in pregnant women, called gestational diabetes. In pregnant women, the placenta will produce female hormones such as estrogen and progesterone that will affect insulin receptors on target cells, increasing insulin resistance. However, when the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to overcome this resistance, it will lead to a buildup of sugar in the blood, leading to diabetes during pregnancy.\nAlthough gestational diabetes will go away as soon as the woman gives birth, she needs effective treatment throughout her pregnancy to avoid negative effects on both mother and baby.\nGestational diabetes requires effective treatment to avoid affecting mother and fetus\nPrediabetes is a type of fasting sugar metabolism disorder or sugar tolerance disorder that causes blood sugar levels to increase but not yet exceed the threshold to be diagnosed as diabetes.\nPrediabetes is the intermediate stage between normal people and type 2 diabetes. About 5-10% of prediabetics will become diabetic every year and a total of 70% of prediabetics will become true diabetics and There is a risk of many dangerous complications if the patient does not receive proper treatment and does not adjust their lifestyle and diet to a reasonable level.\nCause: includes many influencing factors such as risk genes, insulin resistance, increased need for insulin secretion, glucose poisoning, lipid poisoning, disordered secretion/reduced incretin activity, amylin accumulation, reduced cell mass pancreatic beta..., resulting in progressive reduction of beta cell function. The level of reduced insulin secretion and insulin resistance appeared very early, about 13 years before diabetes was diagnosed, and gradually increased over time. Therefore, early detection and active intervention and treatment of people with prediabetes will help reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes and prevent cardiovascular complications and other complications due to increased blood glucose (including increased fasting). and after meals).",
