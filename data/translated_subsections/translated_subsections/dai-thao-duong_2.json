    "subsection_content": "Signs of diabetes vary more or less according to the type of diabetes, sometimes very mild, even without clear symptoms, making it difficult for patients to detect that they have the disease, until the disease has complications. Symptoms have just begun to be examined and treated.\n1. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes\nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes often progress quickly, can appear within a few days or weeks with typical symptoms including:\nFeeling hungry and tired: Normally, the body will convert the food you eat into glucose so your cells can get energy. Cells will need insulin to absorb glucose, however, when the body does not produce enough insulin, or the body's cells are resistant to the insulin produced, glucose cannot be absorbed and get energy. This makes the patient feel hungrier and more tired than usual.; Frequent thirst and frequent urination: Normal people will urinate about 4-7 times within 24 hours, but patients with type 1 diabetes will urinate more often. The reason comes from the fact that in a normal mechanism, the body will reabsorb glucose when passing through the kidneys, but in diabetic patients, the amount of glucose in the blood is pushed up so that the kidneys cannot absorb it all back. As a result, glucose will be excreted through the urinary tract, leading to water excretion, causing the body to produce more urine and the patient to urinate more often. When urinating a lot causes dehydration, the patient will be very thirsty and will need to drink water, but that's why they urinate even more.; Dry mouth, itchy skin: Patients will urinate more, causing the body to become dehydrated, making the mouth area feel dry. At the same time, dry skin can cause diabetic patients to have itchy skin.; Weight loss: In some cases, patients eat a lot but still lose weight after a few weeks due to dehydration and the breakdown of fat and muscle tissue.\n2. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes\nIn type 2 diabetes, symptoms progress silently and develop over many years. Most patients do not experience obvious symptoms like type 1 diabetes, so it is difficult to detect. The disease can be accidentally detected through a blood glucose test or have complications such as infected wounds that do not heal. Some suspicious signs that require examination and necessary tests to accurately diagnose diabetes include:\nYeast infection: Both sexes can experience this condition if they have diabetes. Yeast will feed on glucose, so a high concentration of glucose will cause the fungus to thrive. Patients may find the infection in any moist folds of skin, in between fingers and toes, in the area under the breasts, and even around or in the genitals.; Slow wound healing: Too much sugar in the blood can affect the blood flow of the entire body, causing damage to the nervous system, making it difficult to heal wounds. Besides, patients may feel pain or numbness in their legs. That is also a sign of nerve damage.\n3. Symptoms of gestational diabetes\nPregnant women with gestational diabetes often have no obvious symptoms. Pregnant women may be thirstier than usual and urinate more often. The disease is often diagnosed in the second or last 3 months of pregnancy by performing a 3-sample glucose tolerance test at 24 - 28 weeks of gestation, before type 1 or type 2 diabetes has not been recorded.",
