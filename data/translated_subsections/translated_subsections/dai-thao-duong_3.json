    "subsection_content": "Glucose is an essential substance for the body found in daily foods, serves as an energy source for cells and is stored in the liver to form glycogen. When anorexic, the amount of glucose in the blood will decrease, causing the liver to break down glycogen molecules into glucose to balance blood sugar levels. Thanks to that, blood will transport glucose to tissues to help absorb glucose to provide energy for cells. However, in cases where cells do not absorb glucose directly, the support of insulin (a hormone produced by the pancreas) is needed, which will cause glucose to be absorbed into cells, reducing glucose levels in the blood. Over time, blood sugar will decrease, and the pancreas will also reduce insulin production.\nIt can be seen that abnormal metabolism will prevent glucose from entering cells and providing energy to the body, resulting in sugar remaining in the blood. This imbalance accumulates over time and will cause blood sugar levels to increase.\n1. Causes of type 1 diabetes\nType 1 diabetes is caused by the destruction of the beta cells of the pancreas, so the patient has no or very little insulin left. 95% of the cases are due to autoimmune mechanism (type 1A), due to the immune system mistakenly attacking and destroying cells. insulin production is present in the pancreas, leaving the patient with no or little insulin, leading to sugar accumulating in the blood instead of moving to the cells, 5% of unknown cause (type 1B).\nRisk factors for type 1 diabetes are still being researched. However, most cases of patients with the disease have found that when a family member has the disease, you also have a slight risk of getting the disease. Or environmental factors, exposure to certain viruses are also risk factors for the disease.\n2. Causes of type 2 diabetes\nThe cause of type 2 diabetes is still unclear, some cases report that the disease is hereditary. In addition, overweight and obesity are also closely related to the disease, but it is necessary to distinguish that not everyone who is overweight has type 2 diabetes.\nSome risk factors that can lead to type 2 diabetes include:\nFamily history of parents, siblings, and children with diabetes; Personal history of gestational diabetes; History of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; Hypertension.; Lack of physical activity; Overweight, obese; Have impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting blood sugar; Women with polycystic ovary syndrome\nBeing overweight is one of the risk factors for diabetes\n3. Causes of gestational diabetes\nDuring pregnancy, the placenta will create stimuli to maintain the pregnancy. These stimuli will make cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, the pancreas will produce enough insulin to overcome this resistance. However, in some cases, the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, causing the amount of sugar transported into the cells to decrease and the amount of sugar to accumulate in the blood. Blood increases, leading to gestational diabetes.\nPregnant women who are overweight, have a family history of diabetes, or have been diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance are at increased risk of developing gestational diabetes.",
