If large blood vessels are damaged, it can cause stroke, myocardial infarction, damage to the vessel wall and narrowing of the arteries of the limbs, or even embolism causing limb necrosis. Damage to small blood vessels will cause dysfunction of organs such as the kidneys, retina, and peripheral nerves. If not treated effectively, it can cause chronic kidney failure, leading to the risk of requiring dialysis. kidney transplant or kidney transplant, vision loss leading to blindness, paresthesias in the lower extremities...; Respiratory: Diabetics are susceptible to pneumonia and bronchitis due to bacterial infection; Gastrointestinal: Patients may suffer from periodontal inflammation, liver dysfunction, stomach ulcers, diarrhea.; Skin: Patients may feel itchy skin, often have pimples, yellowish palms and feet, itchy yellow tumors on the soles of the feet, hands, buttocks, pyoderma...; Alzheimer's disease: Patients with type 2 diabetes are at high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.\nSome complications women may experience if they have gestational diabetes include:\nPregnant women may have preeclampsia with symptoms of increased blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs. In addition, pregnant women are at risk of recurrence of the disease in the next pregnancy, and of developing diabetes (most commonly type 2 diabetes) in old age.; The fetus is at risk of developing faster than its age, and is at risk of developing type 2 diabetes later. If the mother does not receive proper and effective treatment during pregnancy, the fetus is at risk of dying before or after birth.",
