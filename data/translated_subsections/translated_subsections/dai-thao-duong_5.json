    "subsection_content": "According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the criteria used to diagnose diabetes are based on one of the following four criteria:\nFasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 126 mg/dL or 7 mmol/L. Patients need to fast for at least 8 hours, do not drink soft drinks, can drink filtered water.; Plasma glucose at 2 hours after the 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) ≥ 200 mg/dl or 11.1 mmol/L. Patients need to fast from midnight before the test, use an amount of glucose equivalent to 75g of glucose dissolved in about 250 - 300ml of water, drink within 5 minutes; 3 days before, you need to eat a diet of about 150 - 200g carbohydrates/day.; HbA1c ≥ 6.5% or 48 mmol/mol. It is recommended that this test be conducted in a laboratory that has been standardized according to international standards.; In case of classic symptoms of hyperglycemia (frequent urination, eating and drinking a lot with unexplained weight loss...) or plasma glucose level at any time ≥ 200 mg/dL or 11.1 mmol/L.\nIn case there are no symptoms of hyperglycemia mentioned above, tests 1, 2 and 4 need to be repeated a second time, about 1 - 7 days after the first time to get an accurate diagnosis.\nCriteria used in diagnosing diabetes\nDiagnosis of prediabetes\nDiagnosis of prediabetes is made when one of the following disorders appears:\nImpaired fasting glucose (IFG) in the range of 100 – 125 mg/dL or 5.6 – 6.9 mmol/L.; Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) at 2 hours after the 75g oral glucose tolerance test was in the range of 140 - 199 mg/dL or 7.8 - 11 mmol/L. HbA1c is in the range of 5.7 – 6.4% or 39 – 47 mmol/mol.\nThese criteria are not enough to diagnose diabetes but warn of the risk of complications occurring in large blood vessels of the disease, called prediabetes.\nReference: Simple and accurate way to test diabetes at home (blood sugar measurement).",
