    "subsection_content": "Proteinuria is a condition in which protein abnormally appears in the urine, causing foamy urine. (first)\nThis protein is usually albumin, a substance found in human plasma, which plays a role in preventing fluid from leaving the blood vessels, while also helping to maintain the stability of colloid osmotic pressure. Besides, albumin also helps bind and transport substances in the human body.\nAlbumin in particular and protein in general can be considered important substances, helping to build muscle tissue and fight infection. However, proteins must be in the blood to perform their function. When protein gets mixed into the urine, this is a sign that the kidneys are damaged and functionally impaired.\nA healthy kidney will not let protein or albumin pass from the blood into the urine in abnormal amounts. Therefore, proteinuria is a precursor to persistent kidney diseases.\nIf the disease is detected at an early stage, it can be completely treated, but patients also need to be aware of maintaining stable kidney health with appropriate nutrition and lifestyle to prevent disease recurrence. If proteinuria persists for a long time without treatment, kidney damage will become more serious, not only causing significant protein loss, but over time will increase the risk of chronic kidney failure in humans.\nThe amount of protein in the urine of healthy people is >150mg/day. People with proteinuria will have a protein index greater than 150mg/day. It should be noted that if this index is about 3 - 3.5g/day, this is a sign of nephrotic syndrome.",
