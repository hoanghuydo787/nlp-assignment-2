In this case, persistent proteinuria will mean long-term, untreated kidney damage.\nFrom here, the risk of complicated kidney-related diseases will also gradually increase over time. Furthermore, the disease will also come with serious symptoms, affecting the patient's quality of life.\nBenign, functional proteinuria caused by excessive exercise or fever will not be dangerous to the patient's kidney health. However, patients still need to pay attention to their health to avoid letting the disease prolong or get worse.",
