    "subsection_content": "Diagnosis of proteinuria is based on urine test results. Test indicators will visually show the amount of protein in urine, kidney condition and disease prognosis. There are 3 methods to diagnose proteinuria: qualitative diagnosis, semi-quantitative diagnosis and quantitative proteinuria diagnosis.\n1. Qualitative diagnosis\nQualitative diagnosis is a way to determine the disease by coagulating protein in urine. Protein is coagulated by burning urine or cooling with sulfosalicylipue. At high temperatures, protein has a coagulation mechanism, from which the amount of protein in urine can be seen with the naked eye.\nIn addition, when the urine of a person with proteinuria is burned, it will cloud the urine. This is also a paraclinical symptom for doctors to diagnose and conclude the disease.\n2. Semi-quantitative diagnosis\nSemi-quantitative diagnosis of proteinuria is simply a method of determining the existence of protein in the patient's urine. This is a simple diagnostic method, using only urine test strips.\nThe test strip contains substances that react with protein, so when exposed to urine containing an unusually high amount of protein, the strip will change color.\n3. Diagnosis of quantitative proteinuria\nQuantitative proteinuria diagnosis has the advantage of accurately determining the amount of protein in urine. The requirements for urine samples to be quantified are 24-hour urine. Furthermore, quantitative diagnostic results also specifically show the components of protein in urine.\nThis is very necessary diagnostic information so that doctors can determine the cause of proteinuria, the location of kidney damage and the current functional status of the kidney.",
