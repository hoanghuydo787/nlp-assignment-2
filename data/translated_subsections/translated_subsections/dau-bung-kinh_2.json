In case the sperm meets the egg and fertilizes it, the fertilized egg will move through the fallopian tube to the uterus to implant and develop into a fetus. If the sperm does not meet the egg and fertilization does not occur, the uterus contracts to push the lining and the egg out of the body, which is called menstruation.\nWhen the uterine wall contracts, the blood vessels in the uterine lining will be compressed, leading to a lack of oxygen in the uterine tissues, causing the release of substances that cause stronger uterine contractions, making women feel more pain.

This substance causes the uterine muscles to contract more with greater force, leading to increased pain levels during this time.\nIn addition to the above causes, having a number of diseases can increase the severity of menstrual cramps, including:\nFibroids;; Endometrial optimism;; Uterine gland disease;; Cervical stenosis;; Pelvic inflammation.\nDoctor Thanh Thao shared that some women have more severe menstrual cramps after having an IUD inserted.
