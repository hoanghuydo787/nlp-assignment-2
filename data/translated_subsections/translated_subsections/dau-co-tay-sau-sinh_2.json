    "subsection_content": "De Quervain syndrome\nDe Quervain syndrome is a condition of narrowing inflammation of the tendon sheath of the thumb (long and short extensor tendon sheath of the thumb). In particular, the inflamed tendon sheath will thicken and sometimes swell, making it difficult for the tendon to move and causing pain, especially when flexing and extending the thumb. (2)\nThe pain can become worse when bending, stretching, rotating the wrist or lifting heavy objects, especially movements involving the thumb. The skin outside the tendon sheath is sometimes red and swollen, and very painful when pressed. After giving birth, the mother's care for the baby can lead to a sudden increase in load on the thumb and wrist, causing this medical condition.\nCarpal tunnel syndrome\nPostpartum women can suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome, leading to numbness, tingling, and pain in the hand area. The cause is due to repetitive movements during child care, causing the wrist to be under a lot of pressure, affecting the structure of the components that go in the carpal tunnel. (3)\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is the most common peripheral nerve compression disease. This is a condition in which the median nerve is compressed as it passes through the carpal tunnel. The consequences of compression are pain, numbness, reduced or loss of sensation in the skin of the hand under the influence of the median nerve. When the disease is severe, it can weaken and atrophy the muscles in the thumb tissue area, making the patient feel uncomfortable. and difficulty in living.\nSymptoms do not appear suddenly but begin and develop gradually over time. The pain often increases at night, waking the patient up and causing insomnia. Bending or supinating the wrist (riding a motorbike) or putting pressure on the carpal tunnel area will increase the feeling of numbness. Symptoms may decrease when the patient stops exercising and rests.",
