    "subsection_content": "Most cases of wrist pain respond well with home care measures. In a small number of cases, pain that does not improve requires medical treatment. (4)\nPain relief measures at home\nDuring the breastfeeding period, doctors often aim for non-drug pain relief measures for the mother, specifically:\n1. Rest\nIncreased pressure on the wrist can trigger or worsen the pain. Therefore, patients should rest and avoid making too many movements of the wrist. This will help reduce pressure on damaged joints, nerves, and tendons.\n2. Use splints\nWearing a splint helps immobilize the injured wrist, preventing pain from recurring when caring for children. In cases of severe pain, this device helps the wrist rest, keep it straight and stabilize the joint. In addition, this measure also helps limit unnecessary movements, reduce wrist joint pain, and prevent recurring injuries.\n3. Massage\nMassage is an effective home treatment for wrist joint pain for chronic tenosynovitis or carpal tunnel syndrome. This method helps relax, reduce pain, increase flexibility and blood circulation, thereby improving pain and helping injuries heal quickly.\nMassage operations should be performed gently. You can rub with a combination of pressing and squeezing from your forearm to your fingers.\n4. Apply cold compresses\nCold compresses are especially effective for patients with acute wrist pain due to injury, or tendonitis or soft tissue inflammation when there are signs of redness and swelling. This method uses low temperatures to constrict blood vessels, reduce blood flow, thereby limiting the accumulation of bruises, reducing inflammation, and speeding up the recovery process.\nYou can place an ice pack or ice pack on the base of your thumb, do this 3-5 times a day, each time about 10-15 minutes. Be careful not to put ice directly on the skin but should have a thin layer because the ice can cause cold burns.\n5. Gentle movements\nWhen the swelling and pain have subsided, the patient should move their wrists and fingers gently. This measure will help improve spasms, reduce wrist pain, increase flexibility, and prevent stiffness.\n6. Correct incorrect movements\nPatients should avoid repeating incorrect movements or positions that can cause wrist pain, such as bending the wrist or overstretching the thumb for long periods of time. When operating, you should note the following:\nWhen taking care of children or doing daily tasks, you should keep your wrists and thumbs in a neutral and comfortable position. When breastfeeding, mothers should not strain their wrists or arms, pay attention to lifting the baby's head with a pillow or forearm and place a pillow under the baby for support. You should hold your baby in different ways. This will help your wrists and fingers have time to rest, avoiding muscle strain. If you need to travel long distances with your baby, you should prioritize using a sling or stroller.\nMedical treatment\nWhen after applying home care measures but the pain still does not decrease or the pain lasts for more than 3 days, the patient should see a doctor for timely and proper treatment. Commonly applied methods when treating postpartum wrist pain include:\n1. Using medicine\nAnti-inflammatory pain relievers are used when patients have wrist pain due to disease. Symptoms do not decrease after a period of home treatment. Commonly used medications include:\nParacetamol: Medicine that helps relieve pain in mild cases; Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Medicines suitable for moderate pain, pain caused by inflammation or accompanied by inflammatory symptoms (swelling, redness...). The medicine helps reduce pain and inflammation, effective after the first dose.; Steroid injection: If the pain is severe and does not respond to the above two medications, the doctor may inject steroids around the patient's damaged tendon or joint. The drug has the effect of reducing inflammation and pain caused by inflammation.\nUsing medication while breastfeeding can affect the quality of the mother's milk. Therefore, patients should only use pain relievers when prescribed by a doctor.\n2. Physical therapy\nDepending on your condition, your doctor will guide you through appropriate physical therapy exercises. Exercises often include light stretching movements, which help control pain and improve mobility and flexibility of the wrist.\nIn addition, this treatment also helps strengthen muscles and reduce tendon and nerve irritation. Your doctor can teach you the correct positions when caring for your newborn. Patients should also adjust their movements and change bad habits that increase pressure on the wrist, causing muscle pain.\n3. Surgery\nVery few cases of postpartum wrist pain require surgical intervention. Because most cases can heal on their own or respond well to conservative treatment. Surgery is only indicated when:\nSevere symptoms, complex pain causes. Does not respond to conservative treatments.\nDuring surgery, the doctor will release the nerve or tendon sheath to reduce compression and pain, while also supporting the recovery process, making movements smoother, preventing pain and inflammation from recurring. .",
