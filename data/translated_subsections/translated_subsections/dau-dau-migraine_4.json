    "subsection_content": "Although migraine headaches are not life-threatening, they can cause serious complications that require immediate medical attention, such as:\nEpilepsy: An extremely rare complication that causes part of the body to convulse and lose control. Seizures often come during or immediately after a migraine aura; Migrainous Infarction: This is a rare complication, mainly occurring in young women, when the brain's blood vessels narrow, causing the brain to lack oxygen. Before a stroke hits, you may see flashes of light, blind spots, and a tingling sensation in your hands or face.; Status Migrainosus: Accounts for 3% of all migraine headaches. Any migraine headache that lasts more than 72 hours is often called a status migraine. The pain and nausea caused by this type of migraine can be so intense that you need immediate medical attention to rehydrate.; Serotonin Syndrome: When treating migraine headaches, Triptan pain relievers may interact with antidepressants, increasing serotonin levels and causing complications such as agitation, confusion, diarrhea, muscle twitching, and heart palpitations; Stomach pain: Migraine headache relievers such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can cause ulcers, bleeding, and stomach pain if you take too much or take them for a long time.",
