If the pain is caused by a medical condition, treatment will focus on addressing the medical condition causing the headache. As the disease improves, the pain will gradually disappear.

In this case, the pain can quickly improve and disappear when treated with appropriate measures.\nUse medicine\nTension headaches often respond well to over-the-counter pain relievers, such as aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil). However, patients should note that overuse of these drugs can lead to chronic headaches.\nFor frequent or severe headaches, your doctor may prescribe prescription headache medications.\nFor migraines, your doctor may prescribe Sumatriptan to help you manage the condition. Other medications that may be used to treat or prevent chronic migraines or cluster headaches include:\nBeta blockers (propranolol, atenolol); Verapamil (calcium channel blocker); Methysergide maleate (helps reduce blood vessel spasms); Amitriptyline (antidepressant); Valproic acid (anti-epileptic drug); Dihydroergotamine; Lithium; Topiramate\nAlternative treatments\nMeditation helps reduce headaches and relieve stress\nSome forms of alternative treatment can help people effectively relieve headaches. These include:\nBiofeedback: Is a technique that helps patients better control the body's physiological functions, thereby reducing pain without the need for drugs; Acupuncture therapy: Inserting special needles into the body's acupuncture points can help relieve pain and relieve stress; Cognitive behavioral therapy: Is a psychological therapy method that helps patients better control stressful situations in life.; Meditation: Effective in relieving stress, improving sleep and controlling pain; Heat therapy/cold therapy: Applying hot or cold compresses to the head and neck for 5 – 10 minutes several times a day can help relieve headaches effectively. Patients should check the temperature before applying hot compresses to avoid burns; When applying a cold compress, do not apply the ice directly to the skin, but wrap it in a clean towel.\nSee details: 16 ways to quickly treat headaches at home without using drugs.\nIn addition, a number of supplements and herbs have been shown to help reduce and prevent headaches, including:\nCoenzyme Q10: According to the University of Minnesota, USA, taking 100mg of this enzyme three times a day (or taking one dose of 150mg per day) can reduce the frequency of migraines.; Magnesium: Some patients with severe migraines receive magnesium infusions to relieve headaches. For other types of headaches, magnesium also provides effective pain relief.; Vitamin B2 (also known as riboflavin): This vitamin helps reduce headaches. According to the University of Minnesota, taking 200 mg of vitamin B2 twice daily may be helpful for people with frequent headaches.\nNote: Before deciding to apply any new treatment method, patients need to discuss carefully with their doctor.
