In addition, excessive stress can also cause headaches in the temples or neck area. The pain is usually dull, not throbbing and less severe. Despite the headache, the patient can still live normally.\nThese types of headaches usually last for a short period of time, about 30 minutes and can last up to 1 week. (first)\nMigraine headache\nThis is a neurological disease characterized by pain on one side of the head, the top of the head or the back of the neck with moderate to severe intensity, affecting daily activities and making the body tired. tired. Migraines can manifest as throbbing and pulsating pain, each lasting from a few hours to 2-3 days, or become chronic - accompanied by nausea, vomiting, sensitive to light/sound,...\nChronic headache\nChronic headaches are headaches that last for 15 days or more. Chronic headaches come in many different forms, including persistent pain at the top of the head.\nCluster headaches\nHeadaches occur in “clusters” and recur daily, sometimes weekly. The pain is usually in the area around or behind the eye socket on one side or spreads to the top of the head and occurs almost at the same time of day (usually in the evening), lasting about 20 minutes to 3 hours, with intensity. intensity.\nCluster headaches can be accompanied by symptoms of drooping eyelids, redness and watery eyes, stuffy or runny nose. The cause of this disease is not yet clearly understood, but some problems such as sleep disorders, alcohol/tobacco abuse or history of trauma are considered high risk factors.

Pain like this usually lasts at least 15 minutes and affects people over 50 years of age.\nAlthough the cause is unknown, many information suggest that this symptom of crown pain is related to the ability to control pain, REM sleep (rapid eye movement sleep - also known as dream sleep) or Melatonin production mechanism (hormone that helps regulate the body's circadian rhythm).\nOccipital neuralgia\nThis problem involves stimulating the nerves leading from the spine to the top of the head, so there is a risk of causing back pain or pain at the top of the head.
