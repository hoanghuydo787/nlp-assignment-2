Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome has a high risk of causing cerebral edema, seizures or stroke – which can lead to disability or death.\nHeadache due to high blood pressure\nUsually high blood pressure does not cause headaches. However, in the case of a sudden increase in blood pressure (from 180/120mmHg or more), the patient may present with headache, pulsating pain, accompanied by physical symptoms such as chest tightness, blurred vision, difficulty breathing. breathing, nosebleeds.\nHeadache due to drug abuse\nExcessive use of over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription pain relievers can lead to headaches; including crown pain or persistent migraine.\nOveruse of pain relievers has the risk of causing persistent headaches or crown pain\nHeadache caused by exercise\nSome people are susceptible to pain at the top of their head when exercising at high intensity – even during sexual activity. Pain like this is called exertional headache and the main cause may be a rapid increase in blood pressure.\nHowever, there is evidence that exercise can help reduce headaches if a source of protein is consumed about an hour and a half before exercise; Warm up and drink enough water before and during/after exercise. If you often have headaches - not just pain at the top of your head - when exercising, you should see a doctor soon to find out more about the cause.\nLack of blood flow to the brain\nAnemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells circulating in the blood is lower than normal. This leads to a lack of oxygen being transported to the brain, causing the risk of headaches, including crown pain. The cause of anemia can be due to iron deficiency, vitamin deficiency or related to thalassemia.\nDue to seasonal weather changes\nChanges in weather lead to changes in atmospheric pressure. This can be the cause of headache symptoms in many people and can be accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.\nSee more:\nWhat is frontal migraine?
