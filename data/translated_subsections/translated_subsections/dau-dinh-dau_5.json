    "subsection_content": "Treatment of crown pain is related to treating and controlling the causes and factors that cause the disease. Accordingly:\nConventional treatment\nCommon treatments for vertex pain include over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, muscle relaxants, and triptans.\nAlthough effective, these medications also have many side effects or interact with other common medications, so you should consult your doctor if you need to use the medication more than 3 days a week.\nAntidepressants may also be used in cases of crown headaches associated with occipital neuralgia. Calcium channel blockers may help reduce headaches associated with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. Headaches caused by high blood pressure may require antihypertensive medications as quickly as possible or emergency treatment to reduce the risk of brain bleeding, stroke, or other dangerous conditions.\nChiropractic treatment\nThis is a way to treat headaches without using many medications.\nPain on the top of the head in many cases originates from incorrect living posture and problems with the position of the cervical vertebrae. The top two cervical vertebrae, the occipital bone, and the bone at the base of the skull are closely related to headaches. Therefore, knowing how to adjust chiropractic will be one of the best ways to treat headaches - especially recurrent pain.\nThe adjustment helps align the upper cervical spine; keeps the neck and head bones, nerves and muscles in the correct position; thereby eliminating the main cause of headaches.\nAdjusting the cervical vertebrae is one way to help reduce crown pain\nOther treatment directions\nMassage, warm bath, head massage, acupuncture or changing lying/working position, etc. are also methods that can be helpful in relieving symptoms of crown pain.",
