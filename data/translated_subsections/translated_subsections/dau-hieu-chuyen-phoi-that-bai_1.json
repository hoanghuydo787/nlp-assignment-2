    "subsection_content": "The causes of embryo implantation failure are very diverse and can be divided into 3 main groups of causes: embryo abnormalities, endometrial abnormalities, and embryo-uterine mucosal interaction abnormalities.\n1. Embryonic causes\nThe embryo is combined from egg and sperm. If either of these two factors is of poor quality, a \"weak in the egg\" embryo will be created. At that time, failure after embryo transfer is understandable.\nEmbryo quality was assessed during culture. At that time, the doctor will observe the embryo's development process and evaluate its quality when the embryo is 3 and 5 days old.\nFor 3-day-old embryos: the doctor will rely on the criteria of quantity, cell size and fragmentation of the embryo to evaluate whether the embryo is good or not. Type 1 embryos are the best embryos, with a high chance of success. Type 2 embryos are average, type 3 are poor, low success rate.; For 5-day-old embryos: the evaluation criterion is the size of the blastocyst sinus. Good embryos will have larger sinuses than other embryos (at the same time of evaluation). There is also the quantity and quality of cells in different parts of the embryo. Good embryos are embryos with many cells, compacted and not fragmented.\nBased on the results of embryo quality analysis, the doctor will conclude whether the embryo is of sufficient quality to proceed with embryo transfer or not. If the embryos are of poor quality, the IVF cycle will be postponed to wait for good embryos.\n2. Abnormalities of the uterine lining\nThe uterine lining is a thin layer that surrounds the inner surface of the uterus, plays an important role in the conception process and will change size (thicken or thin) at different times in the cycle. woman's menstrual period.\nUterine lining that is too thick or too thin has a negative effect on the conception process. A thickness of 8-13mm of uterine lining is considered ideal for conception. If the uterine lining at the time of embryo transfer is <7mm thick, the failure rate will be higher.\nIn addition to size, some factors that reduce the receptivity of the uterine lining include:\nChronic inflammation of the lining of the uterus; Abnormalities in the uterine cavity, such as polyps, uterine septa, or uterine adhesions; Embryo transfer occurs early (before implantation) or late (after implantation).\nInflammation of the uterine lining and abnormalities in the uterine lining are risk factors for multiple embryo transfer failures\n3. Abnormal embryo-uterine lining interaction\nThere are patients who, despite having good quality embryos, beautiful morphological uterine lining on ultrasound, and normal hysteroscopic examination, still cannot conceive after embryo transfer. The problem may lie in abnormal embryo-uterine lining interactions. A minor aspect of this anomaly is the deviation of the nesting window.\nThis process can be simply explained as follows: for the embryo to attach and develop in the uterine cavity, the embryo must be transferred to the uterus at a stage where the uterine lining is capable of receiving the embryo. This stage may vary from patient to patient.\nCurrently, there are many advanced techniques and therapies that help improve uterine lining thickness. In particular, using autologous platelet-rich plasma is a modern method being applied at the Reproductive Support Center of Tam Anh General Hospital System. This method will increase the success rate of IVF for cases at risk of difficulty implanting the fetus due to thin uterine lining or reduced acceptance of the uterine lining.",
