    "subsection_content": "When the doctor informs you that the embryo transfer process has failed, it does not mean that everything is over and you and your husband cannot have children. Doctors always perform techniques to maximize the success rate for each embryo transfer, and the appointment of these techniques will be based on many factors: history, medical history, number of embryos, quality. embryo, characteristics of the previous mucosa preparation cycle... then consider implementing some techniques to help increase the success rate of embryo transfer. Those techniques are:\n1. Treat uterine abnormalities\nTo facilitate embryo implantation, all abnormalities in the uterine cavity such as uterine adhesions, uterine septa, double uterus, uterine fibroids... need to be treated if there is evidence. causal relationship between these abnormalities and adverse outcomes after embryo transfer.\n2. Blastocyst culture\nAccording to statistics, the success rate of day 5 embryo transfer is 1.35 times higher than day 3 embryo transfer. Day 5 embryos are usually of good quality, because only relatively good embryos can develop. to day 5. Embryo transfer on day 5 will be more physiological, with a higher ability to adhere to the uterine lining for implantation. Embryo culture on day 5 combined with embryo screening in patients with the right indications helps increase the chance of having a baby, reducing the rate of miscarriage and miscarriage. Day 5 embryo transfer also helps limit the possibility of multiple pregnancies because each day 5 embryo transfer, the doctor will transfer a few embryos while still ensuring a high pregnancy rate.\n3. Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) screens for chromosomal abnormalities\nChromosomal aneuploidy greatly affects the ability to implant and develop the fetus, especially in the first trimester of pregnancy. Among recorded miscarriages, the number of cases due to embryo/fetal aneuploidy is up to 70%. PGT helps screen and select euploid embryos to transfer to patients, helping to increase the pregnancy rate and reduce the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, and abnormal pregnancy.\n4. Endometrial sensitivity analysis (ERA)\nUsing the latest technology, this test helps analyze the expression levels of hundreds of genes in the uterine lining, thereby optimizing the time of embryo placement in the uterus to promote implantation and pregnancy. . This time is called the \"Window of Implantation\".\nNot only that, ERA can also detect abnormalities in the uterus. If abnormalities are found, the patient is advised to freeze blastocysts. IVF embryo transfer will be postponed until their uterine lining is more receptive to the embryo.",
