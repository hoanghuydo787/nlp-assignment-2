    "subsection_content": "1. Eye strain\nEye strain is a feeling of slight increased pressure or pain behind the eyes, quite common when people use computers in dark offices. Eye strain is not a specific medical condition but rather symptoms caused by constant use of the eyes. Driving, reading small text or working continuously at a computer for long periods of time can lead to temporary blurred vision, dry eyes and a feeling of pressure behind the eyes.\nDry eyes caused by not blinking enough can contribute to an itchy or painful feeling in or behind the eyes.\n2. Migraines\nPain and increased pressure around or behind the eyes are common symptoms of headaches and migraines. Other symptoms may include throbbing pain in the head, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, or seeing flashes of light before the migraine begins. Tension headaches can also make eyestrain worse.\n3. Sinusitis\nThe sinuses are located above, below, behind and between the eyes. Therefore, when sinusitis occurs, the sinuses will fill with mucus and put pressure on the surrounding areas, leading to pain in the eye sockets, nose and areas around the cheeks. Acute sinusitis is the main cause of orbital pain. Other accompanying symptoms include a runny or stuffy nose, loss of smell, headache, phlegm in the throat, fever, cough, fatigue and bad breath.\n4. Eye allergies\nAllergies to external factors such as pollen, dust or animal hair can cause eye irritation, itching and even pain if not treated promptly.\n5. Grave's disease\nAn overactive thyroid gland will cause a number of consequences such as increased eye pressure and eye socket pain. Tissue, fat and muscle throughout the body, especially around the eyes, will swell, leading to the eyes bulging.\nThis is similar to irritation around the eyes, sensitivity to light, tearing more than usual, dry eyes, double vision, eye ulcers, eye swelling, inability to move the eyes and permanent blindness.\n6. Optic neuritis\nInflammation and swelling of the optic nerve can cause orbital pain or increased pressure behind the eye. It can also cause decreased vision, color blindness, blurred vision, pain when moving the eyes, and abnormal pupil response to bright light. Optic neuritis usually peaks within a few days and visual recovery usually takes 4 – 12 weeks.\n7. Corneal damage\nCorneal abrasions and ulcers can cause eye socket pain. The cornea lies on the surface of the eye and has many nerve endings, so it is extremely sensitive to pain. Scratches on the surface of the cornea due to trauma, foreign objects falling into the eye, or overuse of contact lenses can all cause corneal damage. If the wound becomes infected, recovery time will be prolonged.\n8. Chemicals or foreign objects in the eye\nEven a single piece of dust or acid falling into the eye can cause eye socket pain to become serious. This can also damage the eye, leading to ongoing pain as the eye heals or a feeling of increased eye pressure if the eye is swollen.\n9. Blepharitis\nBlepharitis can often be related to certain skin conditions or allergies, where oil glands can become clogged or infected around the edges of the eyelids leading to eye socket pain.\nBe careful of unusual manifestations from the eyes\n10. Conjunctivitis\nConjunctivitis (also known as pink eye) is a condition in which the eyes become red, itchy, swollen or infected due to a number of potential causes such as allergies or chemicals or bacterial or viral infections. Pressure behind the eyes can be a symptom of conjunctivitis.\n11. Chalazion or stye\nLocalized irritation from a lump in or around the eyelid (usually due to a blocked eyelid gland) that can cause pressure or pain to radiate from that area or can also be painful to the touch . A stye is usually more painful and sensitive, while a chalazion is usually painless.\n12. Iritis\nInflammation of the iris (or colored part of the eye) can lead to pain deep inside the eye but also feels like orbital pain. The person may also experience sensitivity to light, redness, spots in the visual field, and blurred vision.\n13. Keratitis\nKeratitis can be caused by overexposure to the sun, bacteria, or the herpes simplex virus. The main symptom of keratitis is eye or orbital pain and may also include sensitivity to light.\n14. Scleritis\nThe white part of the eye is the sclera. Anterior scleritis is the most common form, but posterior scleritis can also cause increased eye pressure or orbital pain. Pain and tenderness are more common symptoms of posterior scleritis, although the eyes are less red than anterior scleritis. It may also be associated with other conditions such as acute angle-closure glaucoma.\n15. Uveitis\nThe uvea is a part of the eye that includes the iris, the ciliary body behind the iris, and the choroid or tissue surrounding the eye. Uveitis includes a group of inflammatory diseases that cause swelling and possible destruction of eye tissues. These diseases can spread to other parts of the eye, including the retina and optic nerve.\n16. Glaucoma\nGlaucoma is a condition in which fluid accumulates in the eye, increasing pressure on the eye, leading to permanent damage to the optic nerve. Most of the time the patient will have no signs or symptoms that would allow early recognition of the disease. However, if not treated promptly, the disease can lead to serious vision impairment.\n17. Acute angle-closure glaucoma\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma is one of the most serious causes of orbital pain and increased eye pressure. Severe orbital pain that occurs suddenly and a rapid increase in intraocular pressure are signs of this disease, and symptoms such as blurred vision, headache, nausea and vomiting may also appear. If acute angle-closure glaucoma is not treated promptly, it can lead to permanent blindness.\nTherefore, patients need to go to the hospital or contact an ophthalmologist for timely examination.",
