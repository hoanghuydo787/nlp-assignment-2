    "subsection_content": "If eye socket pain occurs with the symptoms below, it is time for the patient to quickly seek medical help.\n1. Sudden, severe pain\nSudden, severe eye pain can have many different causes, from dust in the eye to glaucoma. If the patient does not receive proper treatment, it can lead to loss of vision and other serious complications.\n2. Sharp pain\nSharp eye pain can also occur with migraines or cyclical headaches. In some cases, inflammation or fluid buildup in the eye can lead to sharp pain, as well as tissue damage and vision problems. [3]\n3. Tears\nWatery eyes occur when the eyes become inflamed or irritated, such as from allergies or an eye infection. Excess tears are the body's way of trying to wash away substances that damage the eyes. Another possible cause of excessive tearing is clogged tear ducts that cause tears to pool in the eye.\nExcessive tearing is one of the signs of dangerous eye socket pain\n4. Light sensitivity\nSensitivity to light can simply be due to eye strain or dry eyes, or due to problems such as eye infection, eye injury or related to the structure of the eye.\n5. Burning in the eyes\nBurning in the eyes can be caused by blepharitis, allergies or many other eye infections or injuries. [4]\n6. Sudden loss of vision\nSudden loss of vision is a dangerous condition that requires a trip to the emergency room, because loss of vision means the problem may not be on the surface of the eye, but the damage may be inside the eye.\n7. Red eyes\nAmong the possible causes of inflammation that causes red eyes, there are other causes ranging from the most common to potentially serious that can produce changes in vision. If your eyes are not only painful but also red, this is the time to go to the emergency room immediately so that an ophthalmologist can examine you and create a specific treatment plan for each patient.\n8. Persistent headaches\nPersistent headaches can be caused by dilated blood vessels in the eye area. Inflammation of nearby nerves can cause a stabbing, throbbing pain often felt in one eye.\n9. Fever\nSore eyes and fever can be signs of a medical condition such as meningitis, pneumonia, bronchitis, diphtheria, pink eye or a cold. It is also possible to occur due to eye infections, other conditions are caused by allergies, low immunity or eye trauma.\n10. Nausea\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma causes a sudden increase in pressure inside the eye with symptoms including severe eye pain, nausea and vomiting, headaches and impaired vision. This is an emergency and requires treatment as soon as possible to prevent blindness.\n11. Droopy eyelids\nEye socket infections can lead to eye pain, difficulty moving the eyes, and drooping eyelids. When eye pain is accompanied by symptoms of drooping eyelids, it is time to seek emergency medical help.",
