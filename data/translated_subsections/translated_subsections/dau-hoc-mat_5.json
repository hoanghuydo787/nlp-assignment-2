    "subsection_content": "There are many ways to treat eye socket pain:\n1. Antibiotic eye drops\nAntibiotic eye drops can treat bacterial eye infections by killing the components of eye infections such as fungi, viruses, and bacteria. Always use antibiotic eye drops as prescribed by your doctor because they contain pharmaceutical ingredients that regular eye drops (or artificial tears) do not contain.\n2. Eye ointment\nEye ointments can treat many common eye conditions, such as conjunctivitis, dry eye syndrome, and styes. Eye infections caused by viruses, bacteria, and allergies can cause pink eye, as can exposure to chemicals, such as chlorine. Fungi, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases can cause other eye infections. Antibiotic eye ointments work by targeting and killing bacteria.\nTherefore, they are only effective in treating eye infections caused by bacteria. Eye ointment should be used as prescribed by your doctor.\n3. Remove foreign objects in the eye\nIf the object is on the eyelid, try to gently wash it off with water or eye drops. If that doesn't work, try tapping a cotton swab to remove it. If the object is on the white of the eye, gently rinse the eye with water or eye drops.\n4. Surgery\nEye surgery is used to treat a variety of conditions, including cataracts, glaucoma, retinal detachment, retinal tears, diabetic retinopathy, and nearsightedness or farsightedness.",
