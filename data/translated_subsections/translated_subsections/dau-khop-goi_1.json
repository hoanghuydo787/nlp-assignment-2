    "subsection_content": "According to MSc.BS.CKI Dao Duy An Duy, Center for Orthopedics, Tam Anh General Hospital System, there are many causes of knee damage, they are divided into the following groups: (2)\nKnee injury\nKnee injuries can affect the ligaments, tendons or bursae that surround the knee joint, and the bones, cartilage and ligaments that form the joint. Some common knee injuries include:\n1. Ligament injury\nThis is a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament, one of four ligaments connecting the tibia to the femur. This injury is especially common in people who play basketball, soccer, or other sports that require sudden changes in direction.\n2. Meniscus tear\nThe meniscus is a flexible piece of cartilage that acts as a shock absorber between the tibia and femur. The meniscus is torn or stuck in the joint if the knee twists to the side due to sudden force.\n3. Fractures\nThe knee bones, including the kneecap, can be broken due to falls or accidents or injuries. In particular, in people with osteoporosis, sometimes knee fractures can be caused simply by walking incorrectly.\n4. Patellar tendonitis\nThis inflammation causes irritation of one or more tendons, the thick fibrous tissues that attach muscles to bones. It occurs when there is an injury to the patellar tendon. Runners, cyclists, and people who participate in sports that require jumping movements have a higher risk of patellar tendinitis.\n5. Patellofemoral dislocation\nThis is a condition in which the kneecap slips out of its original position and moves to the outside of the knee due to twisting or strong impact, causing pain and swelling of the knee.\n6. Knee bursitis\nKnee bursae are small sacs of fluid, located on the joint, cushioning the outside of the knee joint so that tendons and ligaments work gently on the joint. Overuse of the knee, or injury such as a fall... can cause bursitis, leading to swelling and severe knee pain.\n7. Osgood-Schlatter disease\nThis condition is especially common in adolescents. It causes painful swelling below the knee, where the tendon from the kneecap and the shin connect. Excessive exercise and irritation to a spot below the knee can cause pain in this area. Pain may appear and disappear over time.\nKnee arthritis\nIt can be the result of more than 100 different types of arthritis, the most common of which are:\n8. Knee osteoarthritis\nThis is the most common type of knee arthritis, the leading cause of knee pain in people over the age of 50. This condition occurs when the knee cartilage gradually degenerates over time, causing pain and swelling in the knee joint. up when moving.\n9. Rheumatoid arthritis\nRheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition that can affect most joints in the body, including the knee. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease. The severity of the disease will vary from person to person, and in some cases it can be cured without treatment.\n10. Gout and pseudogout\nWhen uric acid crystals accumulate in the joints, it causes gout, leading to knee pain.\nIn addition, when calcium-containing crystals develop in joint fluid, they can also cause signs similar to gout (pseudogout). At this time, the knee is the most commonly affected joint.\n11. Infectious arthritis\nSometimes, unilateral knee pain can be due to an infection, without any previous injury. Typical signs of this condition are swollen, red, painful joints and fever. Septic arthritis can develop rapidly, causing extensive damage to the knee cartilage. Therefore, if your knee pain is accompanied by any symptoms of septic arthritis, see your doctor immediately.\n12. Patellofemoral pain syndrome\nPatellofemoral pain syndrome is a general term that refers to pain that arises between the kneecap and the underlying femur. This condition is common in:\nAthletes; Young people, especially those with kneecap misalignment; Older adults develop patellofemoral pain syndrome from patellofemoral arthritis.",
