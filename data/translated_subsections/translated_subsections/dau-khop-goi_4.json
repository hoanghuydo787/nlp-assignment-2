However, diagnostic imaging and tests will provide detailed information about the condition, helping doctors come up with the best treatment plan. (3)\n1. Clinical examination\nIdentify the painful area; Information about pain: What time of day is it most painful? When did the pain start and how long did it last?…; Is the knee swollen, painful, red, warm, and bruised? If yes, when did these symptoms start to appear?; Test the ability of the lower leg to move in different directions; Anterior and posterior drawer testing to evaluate structures within the knee.\n2. Imaging diagnosis\nX-ray: Helps detect bone fractures and degenerative joint disease; CT scan: Helps doctors observe the structure and condition of joints more clearly, diagnose bone problems, fractures and accurately identify Gout even when the joint is not inflamed; MRI scan: Particularly useful in showing soft tissue injuries such as ligaments, tendons, cartilage and muscles; Ultrasound: Recreates images of soft tissue structures inside and around the knee, thereby evaluating existing damage.\n3.
