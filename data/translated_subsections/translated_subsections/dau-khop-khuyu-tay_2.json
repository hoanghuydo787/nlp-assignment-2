    "subsection_content": "Elbow pain is caused by a number of causes including: (2)\n1. Osteoarthritis\nElbow pain often occurs in people with osteoarthritis. This is a common form of chronic arthritis, causing damage and wear and tear of joint cartilage, causing the ends of the bones in the joints to rub against each other.\nDegenerative arthritis is especially common in the elderly. In addition to stiffness and elbow pain, patients with degenerative elbow arthritis also have a number of symptoms such as:\nJoint swelling; Limited mobility; Appearance of bone spurs in the elbow on x-ray; When bending or straightening the joint, there is a clicking sound; The elbow joint is deformed\n2. Rheumatoid arthritis\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease that progresses when the immune system is overactive and dysfunctional, continuously attacking the body's healthy cells, causing them to be damaged. In healthy people, the immune system recognizes and attacks foreign allergens. For people with rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system stimulates the production of antibodies that strongly attack the lining of healthy joints, causing arthritis.\nThe disease can affect any joint in the body, including the elbow joint. Pain from rheumatoid arthritis is often symmetrical. Joints are often hot, patients may have sharp or dull pain. After a period of progression, rheumatoid nodules will form at the elbow.\n3. Gout\nGout occurs when uric acid in the body is not eliminated but accumulates in the blood. Over time, they will deposit in joints and tissues in the form of sharp crystals, causing an inflammatory reaction. The patient will have swelling and severe pain in the joints, including the elbow joint. Common symptoms of gout-related elbow arthritis include:\nHeat, redness, swelling, severe pain in the joints; The pain is more serious or starts after drinking alcohol, eating seafood, red meat, animal organs... or using drugs (Aspirin, diuretics), infections, or using chemicals to treat cancer. letters.; The pain reduces after about 5-7 days.; The skin around the joint feels hot to the touch; Fever.; Tired.; Forms tophi particles.\n4. Psoriatic arthritis\nWhen you have psoriatic arthritis, your elbow will become inflamed and severely painful. This is chronic arthritis and autoimmune arthritis. The disease often progresses in stages, occurring after psoriasis. People with elbow arthritis due to psoriatic arthritis often have permanent bone and joint damage, the joint structure is destroyed, and the parts that make up the joint are damaged. This increases the risk of disability and loss of motor function in patients. People with elbow arthritis caused by psoriatic arthritis will have symptoms such as:\nSwelling in one or both joints; Muscle pain, tendon pain; Pain and swelling of elbows and fingers; Pain and stiffness of the spine; Scalp peeling; Pitted nails; Tearing the nail away from the flesh underneath.; Red eyes.\n5. Arthritis caused by lupus erythematosus\nCases of elbow arthritis caused by lupus erythematosus are also quite common. When sick, the immune system stimulates the production of antibodies that attack tissues, including joints. The disease often affects both the joints of the hands and feet. In many cases, the disease also affects the elbow.\nPeople with lupus often have symptoms such as anemia, Raynaud's syndrome, damage to the kidneys, nervous system, pleurisy... causing joint pain, creating arthritis caused by lupus erythematosus.\n6. Bursitis\nBursitis affects the stability of the bursa's function. This is where fluid is stored that lubricates the joints and soft tissues around the joints, reducing movement friction. The characteristic manifestation of this condition is soft tissue swelling, which can be painful when pressed and moved.\n7. Other causes\nElbow pain can also occur due to objective external influences such as:\nInjury: Accidents that lead to injury are also the cause of illness. Therefore, you need to thoroughly treat injuries related to bones and joints. Delaying treatment or improper treatment can cause complications such as disproportionate development of hand bones, pseudoarthrosis, arthritis, joint infection...; Nature of work: Osteoarthritis is common in people whose work is heavy and requires frequent lifting. Inflammation at the elbow joint is often due to the patient having to continuously repeat hand activities (builders, repairmen, etc.).; Playing too much sports: Excessive sports activities and incorrect technique are one of the leading causes of joint and soft tissue pain around the joints. For example, inflammation of the tendon attachment points of the medial epicondyle, lateral epicondyle of the elbow,...",
