    "subsection_content": "During the examination, the doctor will carefully ask the patient's medical history, clinical symptoms, and actual injuries to evaluate the joint condition. In addition, the patient will be prescribed appropriate tests to diagnose the cause of elbow pain such as:\nBlood test: This test will help doctors check uric acid levels, blood sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein..., thereby distinguishing causes of arthritis such as gout, rheumatoid arthritis... In addition, , this test also helps doctors check for infections.; Check joint fluid: The doctor will use a small needle to take a sufficient amount of joint fluid from the elbow, then analyze the sample in the laboratory. Based on the results, the doctor can check for infection, the cause of arthritis, and differentiate between arthritis and related diseases.; X-ray: This diagnostic method helps find bone abnormalities such as bone tumors, bone spurs, fractures, osteoarthritis..., thereby accurately determining the disease condition.; Magnetic resonance imaging MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging helps create detailed images of cross-sections of soft tissue, thereby helping doctors determine the condition and location of damage.; CT scan: A CT scan will create detailed images from many different angles of the bones, helping doctors identify abnormalities within the structure of bones and tissues.; Joint ultrasound: When ultrasounding a joint, high-frequency sound waves will create detailed images of soft tissues such as synovium, cartilage, etc. Through this, doctors can quickly identify damage locations in the system. Osteoarthritis.",
