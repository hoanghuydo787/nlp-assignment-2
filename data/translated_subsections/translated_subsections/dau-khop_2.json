(2)\nOsteoarthritis\nOne of the chronic bone and joint diseases that causes joint fatigue and pain is osteoarthritis. The disease is common in people over 40 years old, especially after 60 years old. Osteoarthritis causes weakening of the joint cartilage and intervertebral discs, accompanied by a decrease in lubricating mucus in the joints and inflammation of the joint synovium.\nThis makes movement of the joints quite difficult, causing pain and stiffness. Most joints in the body are at risk of degeneration, most commonly osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, finger, hand, lumbar spine, cervical spine, shoulder joint, and ankle joint. …\nInfection\nIf you have an infection in your joints (septic arthritis), you need to promptly see a doctor for active treatment to avoid possible dangerous complications.\nInjury\nJoint-related injuries are also one of the common causes of joint pain and joint fatigue.\nDislocation: When moving incorrectly in daily life, working or playing sports, the wrong posture can cause joint dislocation or subluxation. This injury  causes joint pain and can recur many times . If not treated promptly, dislocation can lead to damage to ligaments, joint capsules and other irreversible damage.; Fracture: Is a condition of continuous loss of bone, causing bleeding and pulling of accompanying muscles. This condition can cause bleeding in the adjacent joint and increased pain in the joint.; Ligament damage: This is also one of the common injuries that causes joint pain and aches. Partial or complete rupture of the ligament will cause limited joint movement along with varying degrees of joint pain.\nGout\nDeposition of monosodium urate crystals into tissues causes acute or chronic arthritis.
