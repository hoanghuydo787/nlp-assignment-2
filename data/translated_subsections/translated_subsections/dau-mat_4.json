Damage can quickly spread, so early treatment is needed to avoid dangerous complications.; Conjunctivitis (pink eye): inflammation and infection of the conjunctiva and eyelids caused by a virus. Conjunctivitis causes red eyes, itching, discomfort, and eye pain; Corneal damage: due to scratches, tears, ulcers or keratitis. When the cornea is damaged, the patient feels a lump inside the eye, difficulty opening the eye, congestion, sensitivity to light, blurred vision and burning pain in the eye.; Dry eyes: commonly occurs in office workers who have to sit in front of a computer screen, in cold, dry weather. Dry eyes cause fatigue, redness, and eye pain; Glaucoma: angle-closure glaucoma  causes severe pain, nausea and blurred vision due to a sudden, rapid increase in eye pressure.; Optic neuritis: a condition in which the nerves in the eye become inflamed or irritated. The disease occurs at all ages but is more common in women between 20 and 40 years old. Optic neuritis often occurs in one eye, causing blurred vision, difficulty seeing at night, pain, and increased pain when moving the eye.; Uveitis: a general term used to refer to a group of diseases that cause eye redness, eye pain and inflammation. The disease affects the uvea, the middle layer of the eye, or other parts. If left untreated, uveitis can cause blindness or permanent vision loss.",
