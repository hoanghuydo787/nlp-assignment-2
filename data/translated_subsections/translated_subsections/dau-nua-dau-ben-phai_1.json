    "subsection_content": "There are many different causes of right-sided migraine headaches. Among them, common causes include: (1)\nNeurological problems\nRight-sided migraine headaches often come from neurological causes. Specifically:\nOccipital neuralgia: This is a condition in which the occipital nerves (the nerves that run from the top of the spinal cord to the scalp) are damaged or inflamed. At this time, you will feel a sharp pain in the back of your head and neck, pain behind your eyes and sensitivity to light.; Temporal arteritis: A condition of narrowing of the arteries, blood flow to organs and tissues in the body is reduced because the arteries become inflamed and swollen. When the amount of oxygen and nutrients is not enough for the tissues to function, you may feel a migraine on the right side.; Trigeminal neuralgia: The trigeminal nerve is also known as the trigeminal nerve or cranial nerve. Trigeminal neuralgia can lead to severe pain in the head and face. (2)\nLifestyle factors\nLifestyle issues also increase the risk of right-sided migraines. The following groups of people are more likely to have right-sided migraines:\nFrequently stressed and anxious: People who are often in a state of anxiety about studying, work, etc. are often susceptible to migraines, both left and right; Fatigue: Working a lot, exercising vigorously but not getting enough rest, being exhausted, etc. is the cause of many people having headaches on the right side.; Poor nutrition: Frequently skipping meals, eating inadequate nutrients, and eating a lot of sweets also increase the risk of migraines, including right-sided migraines.\nExcessive stress and worry can also easily lead to right-sided migraines\nSide effects of drugs and drug abuse\nRight-sided migraines can be a side effect of prescription or over-the-counter medications. In addition, arbitrary abuse of drugs, including over-the-counter pain relievers such as aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, etc. can also make it difficult for pain to relieve.\nMigraines due to illness\nPeople with diseases such as migraine, cerebral anemia, brain tumors, etc. or people with signs of stroke can also feel a migraine on the right side. The pain can be dull but can also occur suddenly and intensely, causing the patient to feel sharp and uncomfortable.\nDue to injury\nPeople who are involved in an accident that results in a head injury may experience both headaches or migraines. This is a sign that the internal brain area is damaged and urgent intervention is needed.\nDue to genetics\nRight-sided migraines can originate from genetic factors. Therefore, if family members such as father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, etc. have had right-sided migraines, you are also at higher risk of having headaches.\nDue to hormones\nHormone levels in the body can sometimes be the cause of right-sided headaches. In particular, a decrease in estrogen related to the menstrual cycle, premenopause, menopause, during pregnancy, etc. can lead to migraines.\nPregnant women are also a group of people susceptible to migraines, including right-sided migraines\nDue to the weather\nWeather changes can lead to right-sided migraines accompanied by other symptoms such as fatigue, colds, fatigue, etc.",
