    "subsection_content": "Why do many people have left-sided migraines? What causes left-sided migraine symptoms? Accordingly, left migraine can come from many different causes, such as: (1)\nLifestyle factors\nDue to diet: Frequently skipping meals, irregular diet, drinking a lot of alcohol and alcoholic foods are risk factors that contribute to migraines, including left-sided migraines. Skipping meals causes the brain to lack glucose to maintain activity, increasing the risk of migraines. Wine and alcoholic drinks contain ethanol - a cause of headaches; Stress: Tension headaches are an extremely common condition and many people suffer from this condition.; Lack of sleep: People who have little sleep, often have light, restless sleep or often stay up late are also more susceptible to migraines or left-sided migraines.\nPeople who are often stressed have a higher risk of left or right migraines\nNeurological factors\nLike right-sided migraines, left-sided migraines can originate from neurological factors. Specifically, having neurological diseases such as giant cell arteritis, trigeminal neuralgia, occipital neuralgia, migraine headaches, etc. will make you susceptible to headache attacks accompanied by other symptoms. Other symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, impaired vision, etc.\nDue to injury\nPeople with head injuries due to falls or collisions, whether bleeding or not, are also at risk of migraines, for example left-sided migraines. This may be due to blood or fluid collection under the skull. Normally, after an injury, about 30% of cases have headaches.\nIf you feel a left or right migraine after an injury, the headache becomes increasingly severe and is accompanied by other unusual symptoms such as shaking limbs, weakness in the limbs, being unable to speak clearly, and insomnia. ,... then you should go to the hospital for examination as soon as possible. It may be a sign that there is a blood clot/fluid in the brain.\nDrug abuse\nA little-known fact is that headache medications can lead to more headaches if overused. Left-sided migraines due to drug abuse often occur when you wake up in the morning.\nMedications that can make headaches worse if arbitrarily abused include: Aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil), naproxen (Naprosyn), sumatriptan (Imitrex), zolmitriptan (Zomig), ergotamine derivatives, oxycodone (Oxycontin), tramadol (Ultram) and hydrocodone (Vicodin),…\nMedication abuse can cause left or right migraine headaches to become more severe and prolonged\nInfections and allergies\nFrequent left-sided migraines are a symptom of a respiratory infection (occurs when you have a cold, flu, etc.). Allergies can also cause headaches due to blocked sinus passages, causing pressure on the back of the forehead and cheekbones, leading to headaches.\nIn addition, more serious infections, such as meningitis, encephalitis, etc. can also cause left-sided migraines along with symptoms of high fever, convulsions, body stiffness, …\nDue to hormones\nLeft-sided migraine headaches can occur due to changes in hormone levels in the body. When a hormone level suddenly increases, such as during menstruation or pregnancy in women, it can also \"trigger\" a migraine to occur.\nPregnant women are more likely to have left or right migraines due to hormonal changes\nOther causes\nIn addition to the common causes mentioned above, some other causes can also increase the risk of migraines or left-sided migraines including: (2)\nFrequently wearing hats that are too tight: Wearing helmets or other types of hats that are too tight can often put pressure on the head, causing pain all over the head or half of the head.; Due to glaucoma: Glaucoma is caused by increased intraocular pressure, damaging the optic nerves, leading to symptoms such as eye pain, blurred vision, severe headaches, etc.; High blood pressure: Migraines on the left side can stem from dangerously high blood pressure.; Stroke: A stroke, a blood clot blocking blood vessels to the brain, or bleeding inside the brain causing a stroke can all lead to left or right migraines.; Tumors in the brain: Tumors or unusual foreign objects in the brain can cause extremely intense and sudden migraines, accompanied by other symptoms such as confusion, difficulty walking, slurred speech, and tremors. terrible,…; Blue light: Using electronic devices for long periods of time, exposure to excessive blue light also stimulates your headaches.",
