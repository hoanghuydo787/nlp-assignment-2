Therefore, people in the following groups are more likely to have posterior migraines than the rest:\nHeavy labor group: People in occupations that regularly do heavy labor and porters such as farmers and workers have a very high risk of getting posterior migraine.; Office workers: Excessive pressure at work can cause nervous system stress, leading to posterior migraines. Besides, sitting in the wrong working position (arched back, neck not straight, leaning too close to the screen) also makes posterior migraines most likely to \"visit\" office workers.; Elderly group: With advancing age, health declines, poor blood circulation, hormonal disorders, lack of sleep, the system of ligaments, discs and cervical vertebrae weakens over time; From there, it compresses the nerves at the back of the neck, leading to posterior migraines.; Group of pregnant women: Women before, during and after giving birth due to sudden changes in body weight affecting the pressure on the spinal joints; This then compresses the nerves, causing post-migraine headaches to flare up. Besides, holding and breastfeeding the baby in the wrong position also contributes to increasing the possibility of posterior migraine.; Group of people with injuries: Cervical spine injuries or shoulder-neck-neck injuries due to accidents can leave behind sequelae of migraines lasting many years later.\nYou may be interested in: What is a headache?
