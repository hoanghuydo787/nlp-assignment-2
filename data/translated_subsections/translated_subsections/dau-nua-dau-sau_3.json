The cause is low fluid pressure in the cerebrospinal cavity due to a leak.; Nervous system diseases: The greater occipital nerve, the lesser occipital nerve, the C2 and C3 cervical root nerves are injured due to an accident, or are compressed by tumors and herniated spinal discs can also cause pain. second first half.; Other diseases: Other diseases such as gout, diabetes, vasculitis, and blood infections can all cause damage to the nervous system, including the occipital nerve, causing occipital neuralgia. have posterior migraine.",
