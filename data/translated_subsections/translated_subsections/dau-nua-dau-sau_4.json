    "subsection_content": "To have the right treatment for posterior migraine, you first need to have your doctor accurately diagnose the type of headache and the cause of the headache. However, currently medical science does not have any method to accurately diagnose the cause of posterior migraine right from the first test.\nTherefore, during the diagnosis process, your doctor will ask you many questions about your headache history to collect information about symptoms, pathological characteristics as well as a biological image of your health portrait; thereby delineating the pathology and providing appropriate treatment.\nStep 1: Declare your headache history\nYour posterior migraine may be better diagnosed if you tell your doctor:\nHow long have you had posterior migraines?; How often do you get posterior migraines?; Besides posterior migraines, do you have headaches anywhere else?\nIt's important to tell your doctor how you feel when you have a headache and what happens to you before, during, and after the headache.\nStep 2: Identify symptoms\nAfter gathering your headache history, your doctor will perform a complete physical and neurological examination. Your doctor will look for signs and symptoms of a secondary condition that may be causing your posterior migraine, such as:\nFever or abnormalities in breathing, pulse, blood pressure; Infection, inflammation, nausea, vomiting.; Mental disorders, loss of consciousness, muscle weakness, difficulty speaking, loss of balance, dizziness, vision changes (blurred vision, blind spots).\nStep 3: Diagnostic testing\nThe majority of posterior migraines are benign. However, your doctor may ask you to perform additional medical tests to find the exact cause and rule out certain brain diseases, such as:\nCT scan: Recommended if you are experiencing daily posterior migraines or the pain lasts almost continuously throughout the day.; MRI: An MRI scan helps doctors evaluate parts of the brain that cannot be easily seen with a CT scan, such as the spine in the neck and the back of the brain.; Sinus X-ray: Applicable when your doctor suspects you have post-migraine symptoms caused by sinusitis.; EEG: An EEG is not a standard method for evaluating posterior migraines, but may be done if your doctor suspects you are having epileptic seizures due to a brain tumor.; Blood chemistry and urinalysis: These tests can identify many medical conditions, including diabetes, thyroid problems, and blood infections that can cause posterior migraines.; Eye exam: Eye pressure test performed by an ophthalmologist will rule out  glaucoma or pressure on the optic nerve as a cause of posterior migraine.; Lumbar puncture: Extraction of spinal fluid from your spine for biopsy testing.\nCT scans, X-rays and MRIs allow for accurate diagnosis of many causes of posterior migraines",
