    "subsection_content": "Angina is the term used to refer to pain or discomfort in the chest area, occurring when the coronary artery's blood supply is insufficient to feed the heart, usually due to atherosclerotic plaques in the blood vessel walls. These plaques narrow the arteries and limit blood supply to the heart, especially during exertion.(1)\nWhen angina occurs, you will feel like there is a huge pressure on the chest area, especially the left chest area and behind the sternum. The pain lasts from a few minutes to a few seconds. The pain can even spread to the neck, jaw, shoulders, arms or back.\nAccording to research published in the journal Critical Care (USA), men often have more severe angina symptoms than women and the severity increases with exertion. Worryingly, many women with the disease have described symptoms as just chest, neck or back discomfort - these are signs that are easy to confuse and ignore. In particular, if angina lasts more than 20 minutes, the patient is likely to have a myocardial infarction. This is an emergency, the patient needs to be taken to the hospital as soon as possible for timely treatment.(2)\nSee also: Typical angina: Causes, symptoms and treatment",
