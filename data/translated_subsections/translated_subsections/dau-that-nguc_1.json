    "subsection_content": "There are many causes of chest pain and most are related to heart or lung problems. Angina is a typical warning symptom of coronary artery disease. 90% of chest pain is due to coronary artery stenosis. When the atherosclerotic process lasts for many years with the accumulation of plaque in the vessel lumen, the vessel wall thickens, hardens, loses elasticity and reduces blood flow to the heart muscle.\nThis risk increases strongly with the support of the following agents:\nSmoke; Fat; Hypertension; Diabetes\nAt this time, the heart is forced to work in an oxygen-deficient environment, thereby causing angina. The appearance of atherosclerotic plaques also increases the risk of blood clots forming, causing blood vessel blockage. Therefore, if the blood vessels are not promptly cleared, a heart attack will occur and threaten the patient's life.\nIn particular, coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction are not the only \"culprits\" that cause angina. Less common causes of angina include:\nCoronary microvascular disease;; Aortic dissection;; Myocardial hypertrophy;; Pericarditis;; Muscle pain after exercise;; Costochondritis arthritis;; Shingles, caused by herpes virus infection;; Gastrointestinal symptoms such as heartburn, acid reflux, stomach ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome...\nAccording to Master, Doctor Pham Do Anh Thu - Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City: \"Previously, coronary artery disease was considered a disease of the elderly, because of the high rate of elderly people suffering from arterial disease. There are many coronary artery disease, many people have the disease without knowing it, only when a heart attack occurs do they know they have the disease. Therefore, if the patient does not seek medical attention early, it can delay diagnosis and treatment of myocardial infarction.\"",
