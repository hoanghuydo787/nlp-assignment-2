Heart disease becomes dangerous when unstable angina occurs.\nWhen angina symptoms become severe, last more than 15 minutes and do not improve despite medication and rest, this is a warning sign of an impending myocardial infarction. At this time, the \"golden\" time for myocardial infarction is within 1-2 hours, from the appearance of the first symptoms. Any delay or delay can damage the heart and take the patient's life instantly.",
