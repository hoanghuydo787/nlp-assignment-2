    "subsection_content": "At Tam Anh General Hospital, doctors will examine and perform tests to diagnose the cause of your angina, including:\nElectrocardiogram measurement.; Blood test: when you have a heart attack, your heart will release biological markers (for example: Troponin T or I). If these biomarkers are present in your blood, you may have a heart attack.; Cardiac coronary angiogram: the doctor will place a thin tube in a blood vessel in the arm or thigh. Then put this tube up to the heart. Next, the doctor will inject contrast dye to see the blood vessels that feed the heart. This method helps detect whether the arteries that feed your heart are clogged or not.; Multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) with contrast: can detect clogged blood vessels feeding the heart and blood clots in the pulmonary arteries, among other causes.",
