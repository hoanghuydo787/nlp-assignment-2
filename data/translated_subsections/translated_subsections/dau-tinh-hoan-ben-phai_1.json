    "subsection_content": "Right testicular pain comes from many different groups of causes. Some typical factors to mention include: (1)\n1. Varicocele\nThis is a condition in which the diameter of the spermatic vein inside the right scrotum increases in size, dilates larger than normal (normal diameter of the spermatic veins is < 2mm), causing pain. The main cause comes from the problem of blood stasis, which reduces sperm count and is directly related to the common phenomenon of infertility.\nIn fact, a right varicocele is not too common, often a sign of abnormal venous anatomy, a hernia in the groin or a tumor. Therefore, as soon as men notice suspicious symptoms, they should immediately contact their doctor for timely diagnosis.\n2. Testicular torsion\nTesticular torsion is an emergency that requires immediate medical intervention. This condition occurs when the spermatic cord (including the vas deferens and blood vessels) becomes twisted, blocking blood circulation to the scrotum. If the right testicle is twisted, men will feel sudden, severe pain, swelling, even vomiting and increased urination frequency. Torsion can cause tissue death, leading to orchiectomy if not treated promptly within 6 hours.\n3. Trauma\nInjury to the right testicle can initially cause severe pain and then gradually turn to dull pain. If the pain persists or the scrotum begins to swell, men should contact their doctor immediately to avoid testicular torsion or rupture.\n4. Hematoma\nRight testicular pain can occur after injury or surgery due to hematoma in the scrotum. This condition usually disappears without treatment but has the potential to form calcifications of various sizes. Therefore, for peace of mind, men should immediately contact their doctor from the beginning to limit unwanted problems.\n5. Epididymitis and orchitis\nEpididymitis is a common cause of scrotal pain in adult men. When swollen, it will lead to pain in the entire right testicle. If this condition is not treated early, it can lead to orchitis, affect fertility, and have a high risk of requiring surgical intervention.\n6. Hydrocele\nRight testicular pain can also be caused by hydrocele. This is a phenomenon of fluid accumulation around the right testicle, which is not cancerous but over time will cause pain, heaviness or discomfort. If the condition progresses seriously and the amount of fluid surrounding the testicles is high, the patient will be considered for surgical intervention to remove all the fluid and suture the testicular membrane to avoid recurrence.\n7. Testicular cancer\nInitially, testicular cancer does not cause pain, but if not treated promptly, this symptom will appear. In this case, doctors often prescribe surgery to completely remove the organ.",
