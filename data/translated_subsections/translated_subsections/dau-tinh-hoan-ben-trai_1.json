    "subsection_content": "Left testicle pain comes from many different causes, typically as follows:\n1. Varicocele\nArteries throughout the body carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to bones, tissues and organs. Meanwhile, veins function to carry oxygen-depleted blood back to the heart and lungs. The condition of varicocele forming a vascular bundle that nourishes the left testicle is more common than on the right due to congenital or acquired anatomical abnormalities.\nThis leads to left testicular pain with symptoms of dull pain and discomfort, directly affecting daily activities.\n2. Orchitis\nThis is a condition in which the testicles become inflamed due to a bacterial or viral infection. The pain usually starts in the left testicle and can then spread throughout the scrotum. In addition, the scrotum is also at risk of swelling, gradually turning red and becoming firmer than normal.\nIn most cases, the mumps virus is the leading cause. Infections are often transmitted sexually, gonorrhea, urinary tract infections...\n3. Epithelial cyst\nThis is a fluid-filled sac that forms in the peritoneal duct surrounding the neurovascular bundle (also known as the spermatic cord) from the upper part of the testicle. Abnormal symptoms will not appear if the cyst is still small. When it grows to a larger size, the patient will feel pain and heaviness at this location.\n4. Testicular torsion\nThis is considered an emergency that requires immediate medical intervention. This condition occurs when the spermatic cord becomes twisted in the testicle, cutting off the blood supply to the organ. Within 6 hours, if the patient does not receive timely treatment, there is a risk of having to have the testicles removed. Specifically, the common symptoms are sudden pain and swelling.\n5. Hydrocele\nInside the scrotum is a thin layer of tissue that surrounds the testicles. If fluid or blood fills this shell, it will lead to hydrocele. At this time, the scrotum may swell with or without pain. This is also one of the main causes of left testicular pain, which often occurs in newborns and tends to go away on its own within a year or so. In boys or adult men, this phenomenon often occurs due to inflammation or injury.\n6. Trauma\nThe testicles are easily injured during sports, collisions or accidents. In addition, because the left testicle hangs in a lower position than the right, the risk of damage is also higher. Although minor injuries only result in temporary pain that subsides over time, serious cases require prompt care to avoid danger.\n7. Testicular cancer\nThis is a condition in which malignant tumors form in the testicles, with the risk of metastasizing to other parts of the body. Currently, the main cause has not been accurately determined. Cancer is often discovered during a routine health check-up. Typical symptoms are the appearance of a tumor, swelling in the scrotum, and pain that appears and gradually increases over time.",
