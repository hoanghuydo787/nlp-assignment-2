    "subsection_content": "Testicular pain is a painful condition that occurs in one or both testicles, and can begin suddenly or last longer depending on the case. This problem often affects men of all ages. (first)\nSpecifically, testicles are small, egg-shaped sex organs located inside a thin bag of skin (scrotum). The main function is to produce sperm and androgen hormones, mainly testosterone. Testosterone release is controlled by anterior pituitary luteinizing hormone. Meanwhile, sperm production will be controlled by anterior pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone and gonadal testosterone.\nWhen testicles have sharp pain, the pain can be acute (appears suddenly and does not last long) or chronic (gradual and lasts). Most cases stem from sudden injuries, causing severe pain because this location contains many sensitive nerves.\nHowever, pain can also originate from other factors, even not entirely from the testicles but from another part of the body such as the inguinal scrotum, scrotal area, kidneys, and ureters. This type is called transitional pain.",
