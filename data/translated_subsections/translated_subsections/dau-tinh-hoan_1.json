    "subsection_content": "Besides the obvious cause of injury or accident, testicular pain can also stem from the following factors: (2)\n1. Orchitis\nOrchitis appears with swelling, heat, redness, and pain in one or both testicles and may be due to a bacterial or viral infection. In children, mumps virus is also one of the leading causative factors. In this case, signs of swelling usually begin to appear 4-6 days after the onset of mumps.\n2. Inguinal hernia (groin)\nAn inguinal hernia occurs when part of the intestine or omentum is pushed through a weak part of the abdominal wall muscle into the scrotum. This condition is usually not dangerous but causes pain and discomfort. Some cases may require emergency surgery such as strangulated inguinal hernia\n3. Epididymitis\nThe epididymis is a group of thin, curled tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the vas deferens and out of the body. When inflammation occurs, men will feel pain, the scrotum will be swollen, hot to the touch, and the epididymis will become large and hard. Symptoms of epididymitis usually last a few days to a few weeks, and in chronic cases it will last more than 6 weeks.\n4. Epididymal cyst\nThis is a fluid-filled space that can form inside the epididymis near the testicles. These cysts are not cancerous and are usually painless, but sometimes they grow large, causing discomfort to the patient.\n5. Hydrocele\nThis condition is very common and occurs when fluid accumulates around the testicles, sometimes causing pain and infection.\n6. Hematoma\nThis condition occurs when blood surrounds the testicles, usually as a result of trauma.\n7. Varicocele\nThis is a condition in which a group of large veins appear abnormally near the testicles. This causes a dull feeling of discomfort, greatly hindering daily activities. The pain often tends to subside when lying down. In many cases, varicocele also affects fertility, most of which must be treated with surgery.\n8. Testicular torsion\nTesticular torsion is a twisting of the blood supply to the testicle, leading to severe pain. This condition can occur at any time, requiring immediate surgery to avoid the risk of testicular necrosis.\n9. Kidney stones\nKidney stones occur more commonly when the body is dehydrated. At this time, the stone can get stuck in the ureter (the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder), causing back pain and pain spreading to the external genitals or pelvis. Depending on the size, the stone will pass out on its own or require surgical intervention.\n10. Post-vasectomy pain syndrome\nMen after a vasectomy will sometimes feel testicular pain. This pain often comes from increased pressure in the vas deferens or epididymis.\n11. Urinary tract infection\nBacteria that enter the urinary tract, including the urethra, bladder, and kidneys, can lead to genital tract infections. One of the common symptoms of this condition is testicular pain accompanied by painful urination, hematuria, and hematuria. Infections may go away on their own or require antibiotics depending on the severity.\n12. Testicular cancer\nTesticular cancer appears most commonly in men between the ages of 15 and 35. Sometimes, the symptoms encountered are a dull pain in the scrotum, groin, testicles, testicular swelling, pain in the lower abdomen, etc. In this case, the doctor will prescribe additional in-depth tests such as diagnostic imaging and cell tests to come to the most accurate conclusion.",
