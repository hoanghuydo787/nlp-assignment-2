    "subsection_content": "Depending on the severity, your doctor will prescribe appropriate testicular pain treatment. As follows:\n1. Treatment at home\nApply ice to the painful area; Place a rolled towel under the scrotum while lying down.; Take a warm bath.\n2. Use medicine\nIf home treatments are not effective, men may be prescribed medication, including:\nPain relievers: Acetaminophen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), including Aspirin, Ibuprofen, and Naproxen, can help relieve pain. These are often prescribed in cases where the pain appears due to injury or inflammation of the testicles.; Antibiotics or anti-infective drugs: These drugs are often prescribed for pain caused by orchitis and epididymitis.; Tricyclic antidepressants, such as Amitriptyline can be used to treat testicular pain caused by nerve damage.\n3. Surgery\nTesticular pain usually does not require surgery, except in emergencies such as testicular torsion or testicular cancer. As follows:\nSurgery for testicular torsion: The doctor will untwist the spermatic cord and restore blood flow to the testicles. The next step is to sew stitches around the testicle to avoid repeat damage, including on the opposite side.; Hernia repair surgery: This procedure is performed if the hernia cannot be pushed back into the abdomen or reduced in size.; Epididymectomy: Surgeons may remove the epididymis if signs of chronic pain do not respond to medication.; Reattaching the vas deferens: This method is indicated in cases where men have testicular pain due to vasectomy. However, this treatment option is rarely performed, and if it is, it is usually performed as outpatient surgery.; Shock wave lithotripsy: This is a minimally invasive procedure that uses shock waves to break up kidney stones.; MDSC method: This operation is performed through anesthesia. Specifically, the surgeon will use a surgical microscope to dissect and cut the nerves passing through the spermatic cord, aiming to cure or relieve testicular pain.; Orchiectomy: This is a last resort but rarely occurs, only performed in cases where the pain cannot be effectively treated with medication or less invasive procedures.\nAfter any surgery, it is important to provide proper and thorough wound care to prevent infection. For this issue, men should discuss carefully with their doctor for detailed instructions. In addition, patients also need to have regular check-ups to be monitored and checked regularly to avoid unwanted problems that may occur.",
