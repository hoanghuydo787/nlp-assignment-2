    "subsection_content": "Women have chest pain and breast pain for many different reasons, which need to be clearly identified to have appropriate remedies. Women can refer to the common causes of breast pain below:\n1. Hormonal changes\nThis type of breast pain occurs due to changes in the hormones that control the menstrual cycle. These hormonal changes can cause pain in both breasts in the few days before menstruation. Because the pain can come and go with the menstrual cycle, it is called cyclical breast pain.\n2. Chest trauma\nBreast pain can originate from the chest wall, chest muscles or due to problems with nerves in the thoracic spine such as pulled muscles, inflammation around the ribs, chest wall trauma (being hit in the chest), broken bones... causing colds. Severe swelling, bruising, a large mass in the breast, redness and warmth in one breast (may be a sign of infection), angina, sprain or back injury.\n3. Wearing an inappropriate bra\nIf the bra size and style are not suitable, it can cause the ligaments connecting the breasts to the chest wall to stretch too much, causing discomfort and pain in the breasts. The pain may increase with vigorous activity or while you exercise. Bras that are too tight not only cause chest pain but also cause difficulty breathing, back pain, headaches, and shoulder pain.\n4. Breast inflammation and infection while breastfeeding\nDuring the breastfeeding period, many women often experience breast pain with a number of symptoms such as:\nNipples are sore because the baby is not latching properly.; Tingling feeling when breastfeeding; Sore nipples due to biting or dry, cracked skin or nipple infection; Breastfeeding women are more likely to develop breast infections (mastitis) with symptoms such as swelling, heat, redness, and pain.\nIf you have pain while breastfeeding, you should talk to your doctor or counselor. Your doctor can help you correct the problem and maintain your baby's milk supply. In case of breast infection, it is necessary to see a specialist. Treatment usually includes antibiotics and pain relievers, sometimes requiring aspiration of pus from the abscess or surgery if more severe.\n5. Side effects of drugs\nThe cause of breast pain also includes side effects of medication. Some medications that can cause breast pain that women need to be aware of include:\nOxymethone, used to treat some forms of anemia; Chlorpromazine, used to treat mental health conditions; Diuretics are used to treat kidney disease, heart disease, and high blood pressure.; Hormone therapy (birth control pills, hormone replacement, or infertility treatment).; Digitalis is indicated in the treatment of patients with heart failure.; Methyldopa is used to treat high blood pressure.\n6. Place the breast implant in the breast\nSome women may experience complications when placing breast implants (silicone or saline), leading to severe breast pain. One of the most common causes of pain after breast augmentation surgery is capsular contracture, when scar tissue forms too tightly around the breast implant. Chest pain can also be a sign that one of your breast implants has ruptured.\nWomen may experience breast pain after breast implants are placed\n7. Breast cysts\nBreast pain can be caused by various types of breast tumors, including benign breast tumors such as fibroids, breast cysts, milk cysts, lipomas, phyllodes tumors... or breast cancer. In this case, a thorough examination is needed to accurately diagnose the nature of the tumor, whether it is benign or malignant.\n8. Signs of breast cancer\nInflammatory breast cancer often causes pain but is rare, accounting for 1% to 5% of breast cancer cases. Symptoms of this serious disease often appear suddenly and progress rapidly. Inflammatory breast cancer can cause the mammary gland to swell, very similar to a breast abscess, with early-stage symptoms such as: nipples retracting or changing shape, pain anywhere on the breast, unusual discharge. usually on the nipple, sunken breast skin, lumps or lumps in the breast...",
