    "subsection_content": "Tests to evaluate your breast pain may include:\nClinical breast exam: your doctor will check for changes in your breasts, and check the breasts and lymph nodes in your lower neck and armpits. Your doctor will likely examine your heart and lungs, and examine your chest and abdomen to determine whether the pain may be related to another medical condition. If your medical history and breast exam and physical exam show no abnormalities, you may not need further testing, if you have had good routine breast cancer screening.; Mammogram (mammogram): if your doctor feels there is a lump in your breast or unusual thickening or finds a concentrated area of ​​tenderness in your breast tissue, you will need an X-ray -mammogram to evaluate areas of concern found during a breast exam (diagnostic mammogram), especially if you are of breast cancer screening age.; Bilateral mammogram: an ultrasound test uses sound waves to create images of your breasts, and it's often done along with a mammogram. You may need an ultrasound to evaluate the area of ​​focal pain even if the mammogram appears normal.; Breast biopsy: suspicious lumps in the breast, areas of thickening, or abnormal areas seen during an imaging test may require a biopsy before your doctor can make a diagnosis. During a biopsy, your doctor will take a small sample of breast tissue from the area suspected of being abnormal and send it for cell analysis or pathology in a laboratory.\nIn summary, the first thing a doctor does to evaluate a patient with breast pain is to examine whether the patient has any breast disease or not and find the cause of breast pain. In women 40 years of age and older, your doctor will perform an evaluation similar to a breast cancer screening. Depending on each person's risk, there are different ways to evaluate according to cancer screening principles, but the most important thing is to clearly advise patients to understand and reduce anxiety!\nYour doctor also evaluates your personal breast cancer risk, based on factors such as age, family medical history, and history of precancerous breast lesions.",
