Women can ask their doctor about whether switching birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy can help reduce breast pain.\n2. Avoid medications that irritate the breasts\nPain relievers such as acetaminophen or stronger pain relievers such as ibuprofen can be used, but you should consult your doctor about dosage, because long-term use may increase the risk of liver disease and other side effects.\nConsider using an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, Panadol, etc.) or ibuprofen (Advil, Mobic, etc.) but ask your doctor about how much to take, as long-term use can cause increased risk of liver problems and other side effects.\n3. Wear a bra that fits well\nWear a fitted bra with steel underwire during the day and a soft, supportive bra at night. When exercising, you should wear a specialized sports bra to ensure the best elasticity and support.\n4. Change your diet\nLimit or eliminate caffeine, and build a diet low in fat, reduce salt and increase complex carbohydrates.\n5. Regularly examine and screen for breast disease\nWomen should have regular check-ups to rule out diseases in the mammary gland, especially when there are signs of breast pain or tumors in the breast, so they should have a follow-up plan in the breast cancer screening program recommended by the doctor. All women over 40 years old should be screened for breast disease once a year. Younger people can get screened every 2-3 years.\nParticularly for people at high risk such as: Having relatives or family members with breast cancer or ovarian cancer; there are signs of abnormalities in the mammary gland; People who have early menstruation, late menopause, have not given birth, are not breastfeeding, have had irradiation in the chest area, are obese, abuse hormonal drugs, drink too much alcohol... should be examined and screened every 6 months. 1 times.\nBreast pain is mostly benign, but can also be a warning sign of mammary gland disease, which should be closely monitored. Ideally, when women notice unusual breast pain of unknown cause, they should immediately go to a reputable hospital for examination, screening, and maximum health protection.",
