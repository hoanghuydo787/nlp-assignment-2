This causes the fetus's blood vessels to operate on their own without the protection of the placenta when connected at the umbilical cord. (first)\nDoctor Duong Viet Bac, Doctor at the Center for Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tam Anh General Hospital in Hanoi, said that in obstetrics, umbilical cord adhesion to the amniotic membrane is a rare but extremely dangerous phenomenon for both pregnant women and fetuses. . This condition interferes with receiving oxygen and absorbing nutrients to nourish the fetus, or in other words, the umbilical cord clings to membranes, causing the fetus to only absorb a maximum of 30% of nutrients. This is the cause of fetal malnutrition, premature birth and stillbirth at any time.\nIn addition, the disease is extremely dangerous during labor because uterine contractions can tear the amniotic membrane, break the placenta, cut off the blood supply that nourishes the fetus, causing the fetus to suffocate, causing sudden loss of fetal heart rate and died in the mother's womb.\nIn addition, abnormal umbilical cord attachment positions such as membranous cord adhesion and marginal cord attachment also increase the risk of obstetric complications such as placenta previa, placental abruption, preeclampsia...
