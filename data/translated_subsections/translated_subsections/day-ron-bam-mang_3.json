To minimize the risk, pregnant women need to follow the regular prenatal check-up schedule to get a fetal ultrasound to detect the condition early, if any.\nIn case a fetal ultrasound detects that the fetus has a membranous umbilical cord, the pregnant woman needs to closely and strictly follow the doctor's pregnancy monitoring and management schedule. The schedule for examination and fetal monitoring can be more dense to help the doctor closely monitor the condition of the fetus and ensure there are no abnormalities in the placenta.\nSee more: Abnormalities in the placenta during pregnancy",
