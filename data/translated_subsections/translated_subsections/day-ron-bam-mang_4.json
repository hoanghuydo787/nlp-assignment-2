When entering the third trimester (last 3 months of pregnancy), this condition is more difficult to detect. Ideally, pregnant women should have regular prenatal checkups because the risk of placental cord rupture can occur at any time when the pregnant woman has her first uterine contractions.\nColor Doppler ultrasound helps accurately detect this condition up to 99%\nAbnormal symptoms during pregnancy are also contributing factors to diagnosis. If a pregnant woman has vaginal bleeding, or the fetus has a slow heart rate, the doctor may prescribe an additional ultrasound to detect abnormal umbilical cord conditions.\nTam Anh General Hospital System's Obstetrics and Gynecology Center is equipped with a modern machinery system, including a color Doppler ultrasound system that helps detect membrane-bound umbilical cords with an accuracy of up to 99%.",
