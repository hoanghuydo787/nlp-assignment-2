    "subsection_content": "According to research, children reach puberty when the brain begins to produce a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). This hormone goes to the pituitary gland to help stimulate the production of estrogen hormone (hormone involved in growth and development of sexual characteristics in women) and testosterone hormone (hormone responsible for growth and development). sexual characteristics in men).\nPrecocious puberty in children can be caused by many other causes such as tumors on the ovaries, adrenal glands, pituitary gland, brain or central nervous system problems, hormone disorders, trauma. brain, family medical history or due to some rare genetics. Even in many cases of early puberty, no specific cause can be found.\nEarly puberty makes children feel self-conscious.\n1. Central precocious puberty\nCentral precocious puberty is a condition in which puberty begins too early, however, the steps in the puberty process do not appear to be abnormal, nor do the child have any underlying medical problems. Therefore, in most cases of central precocious puberty, the exact cause cannot be determined. In some cases, children with this disease may be concerned with the following problems:\nCentral nervous system (brain, spinal cord) tumor.; Brain or spinal cord exposed to radiation.; Brain or spinal cord damage; Hereditary McCune-Albright syndrome affects bone development, skin color and hormones.; Defects appear during birth: hydrocephalus, benign lung tumor (hamartoma),...; Children with hypothyroidism – The thyroid gland cannot produce enough hormones needed for the body.; Children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia – Genetic disorder related to hormone production in the adrenal glands.\n2. Peripheral precocious puberty\nPeripheral precocious puberty is a less common condition of precocious puberty that is not related to the hormone GnRH. The cause of early puberty in children comes from the release of estrogen or testosterone in the body due to problems occurring in the child's ovaries, testicles, adrenal glands or pituitary gland. Some problems that can cause peripheral precocious puberty include:\nChildren have tumors in the adrenal or pituitary glands that cause secretion of estrogen or testosterone; Children with McCune-Albright syndrome cause abnormal skin and bone development and hormonal disorders; Children are often exposed to products that stimulate estrogen or testosterone such as creams, ointments, etc.\nBesides, peripheral precocious puberty in women can be related to problems such as ovarian cysts and ovarian tumors. On the other hand, peripheral precocious puberty in men can be caused by a tumor in the cells that produce sperm (germ cells) or in the cells that produce testosterone (Leydig cells) or by a disorder Genetics that occur in children born in families with independent sex with gonadotropins cause the body to produce testosterone early (from 1-4 years old).",
