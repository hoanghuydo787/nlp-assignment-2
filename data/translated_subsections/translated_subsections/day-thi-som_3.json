Height restrictions\nEarly puberty causes children to grow taller faster than their age, so parents should monitor their children's height growth.\nWhen children reach puberty early, their height will grow rapidly, higher than the height according to their age. However, when this puberty process ends, this height growth will stop. That is, children who go through puberty early will end it early, and their growth and bone development process will also end sooner. Finally, as adults, children with precocious puberty will often be shorter than children with puberty at the right age.\n2.

In particular, changes in bust size and early menstruation can be problems that cause discomfort and annoyance in children under 9 years old.\nFurthermore, early puberty can be the cause of emotional and behavioral changes in children. Children easily become irritable and angry, and may begin to be curious and have sexual needs that are not appropriate for their age.\nEarly puberty causes children to grow taller faster than their age, so parents should monitor their children's height growth.",
