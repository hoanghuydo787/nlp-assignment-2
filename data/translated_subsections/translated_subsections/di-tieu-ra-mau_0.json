    "subsection_content": "Blood in the urine, also known as hematuria, is a phenomenon in which urine excreted from the body is mixed with blood or light pink in color. The density of urine will depend on the type of hematuria the patient has and the amount of red blood cells (blood) leaked into the urine. There are two types of hematuria: microscopic hematuria and gross hematuria. (first)\nIf a patient has gross hematuria, the disease can be recognized with the naked eye with the typical symptom of urine turning pale pink or red. However, people with microscopic hematuria will not be able to see blood in their urine. The red blood cells of microscopic hematuria are only visible under a microscope during a urine test.\nHematuria is among the symptoms that appear when patients suffer from urinary diseases.\nOverview of the urinary system in the human body including 2 kidneys, 2 ureters, bladder and urethra. The main function of the urinary system is to filter excess waste from the body. Furthermore, the urinary system also helps the body control the amount of electrolytes, metabolites, regulate blood and regulate blood pressure.\nThe kidneys are organs located just below the rib cage, on one side of the spine. Kidneys have the function of filtering urine and blood. Every day, healthy kidneys can filter 120-150 liters of blood and 1-2 liters of urine, along with waste and other additional fluids.\nAfter being filtered by the kidneys, urine goes to the bladder, where urine is stored before being excreted through the urethra.\nTherefore, when hematuria appears, it is very likely that you have a disease related to the kidneys, bladder or urethra. The most common is acute urinary tract inflammation.\nHematuria can be completely cured when the patient treats all the causes of hematuria, which are diseases from the organs of the urinary system.",
