The urine of people with hematuria is generally pale pink or red, depending on the amount of red blood cells. (2)\nSometimes, gross hematuria also includes blood clots in the urine. And if left for a long time, red blood cell sedimentation will occur.\n2. Microscopic hematuria\nMicroscopic hematuria (Microscopic hematuria) is a form of bloody urine but the number of red blood cells in the urine is quite small and cannot be seen with the naked eye. Normally, the number of red blood cells in urine above 10,000 red blood cells/ml is microscopic hematuria. Red blood cells in microscopic hematuria can be found under a microscope. Therefore, people with microscopic hematuria often do not know they have the disease until a urine test is performed.",
