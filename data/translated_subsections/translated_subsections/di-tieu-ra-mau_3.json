    "subsection_content": "1. Cystitis\nCystitis is an acute or chronic inflammation of the bladder. Bacterial infection is the most common cause, accounting for more than 50% of cystitis cases.\nBesides symptoms such as frequent urination and painful urination, cystitis can cause bleeding, called hemorrhagic cystitis. This is a sign of severe progressive cystitis, causing swelling and bleeding of the bladder.\n2. Infection\nInfections in the bladder, kidneys, urethra or prostate in men are among the causes of hematuria.\nThis infection is an inflammation caused by bacteria when it enters the urinary system organs such as the bladder, kidneys, glomeruli or urethra. Inflammation, if severe, will lead to bleeding. This amount of blood will be excreted with urine. This is blood in the urine due to infection.\n3. Urinary stones\nUrinary stones are known to form hard mineral masses inside the urinary organs, most commonly the bladder and kidneys. These stones develop when minerals in concentrated urine crystallize and eventually form stones. (3)\nOne of the symptoms of kidney stones is blood in the urine. This is a clinical sign when the stone mass rubs against the urinary mucosa along the urine stream. This collision causes damage to the mucosa, causing the mucosa to bleed.\n4. Kidney tumor\nKidney tumors are benign or malignant tumors that appear in the kidney. Tumors, if benign, will not seriously affect the patient's health. However, patients still need to pay attention and treat the disease as soon as possible.\nInside benign tumors there is still the possibility of malignant cells appearing. These cells are the cause of compression of other organs when dividing and growing in a short time. This greatly impacts the health and life of patients.\nMalignant kidney tumors will have no clinical signs in the early stages. When the patient enters a more severe stage, the disease will appear symptoms such as blood in the urine, back pain, weight loss and severe anemia.\n4. Prostatic hypertrophy\nProstatic hypertrophy is a urological disease in men that causes benign proliferation of the stromal tissue and glandular mucosal cells. In other words, this is an enlargement of the prostate leading to symptoms such as frequent urination, urgency, and urinary retention.\nHematuria is one of the symptoms of prostate enlargement. However, hematuria is not as common as the above symptoms.\n5. Kidney disease\nKidney diseases such as glomerulonephritis or nephritis can cause hematuria in patients. For glomerulonephritis, hematuria is a phenomenon caused by the glomeruli's impaired blood filtering function, causing red blood cells to leak into the urine.\nNephritis and acute pyelonephritis can also lead to hematuria due to inflammation.\nAcute kidney diseases can be treated simply with medication or in some cases go away without treatment.\n6. Idiopathic\nIdiopathic hematuria is when no direct or indirect cause of blood is found in the urine during the process of being eliminated from the body.\nIdiopathic hematuria can happen to family members. People with hematuria due to a family history of kidney-related disease with symptoms of hematuria, but laboratory test results are negative, can recover without treatment.",
