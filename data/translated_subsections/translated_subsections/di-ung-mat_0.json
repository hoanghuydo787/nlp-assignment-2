    "subsection_content": "Eye allergies, or allergic conjunctivitis, occur when the eyes come into contact with irritants (called allergens). The disease affects all age groups and is common in spring, summer and fall. [2]\nAn allergy is the immune system's response to a foreign substance that is not harmful to the body. Similarly, when allergens come into contact with the eyes, the body will produce histamine to fight these agents. However, when the immune system creates substances to fight allergens, these substances, although harmless to the body, cause a number of symptoms such as itching, redness, burning, etc., thereby creating the phenomenon of eye allergies.\nPeople with eye allergies often have nasal allergies (itching, stuffy nose and sneezing), but this condition is only temporary. When suffering from allergies, patients often experience itching and redness in 1 or 2 eyes. The disease is not transmitted from person to person.\nThere are two types of eye allergies: seasonal and perennial.\nSeasonal eye allergies: occur at certain times of the year, usually early spring to summer and into fall. The main allergens are pollen from plants, mold spores, etc.; Perennial allergies: occur all year round. Agents include dust mites [3], pet hair, perfume, smoke, cosmetics [4], some medications can also cause eye allergies, etc.",
