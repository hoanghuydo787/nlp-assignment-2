    "subsection_content": "1. Pollen\nEye allergies caused by pollen are common, especially during flowering season [5]. Allergies occur because the immune system recognizes pollen as a foreign object entering the body and needs to be destroyed. Besides, the composition of pollen contains protein, cellulose, pentose, dextrin, phosphorus, which are substances that easily stimulate immune responses.\nPollen types that cause allergies are usually very small in size, less than 0.5mm. Pollen from grasses and wind-pollinated plants causes more allergies than other flowering plants. Pollen allergy does not affect your health much, but it causes a lot of trouble. Visible symptoms are itching, redness, and watery eyes.\n2. Dust mites\nDust mites are microscopic organisms that live in household items such as bedding and carpets [6]. Although they do not bite, sting or reside on the human body, dust mites cause some allergies. Dust mite allergies can range from mild to severe. In severe cases, the patient may sneeze, cough, have a stuffy nose, or have persistent asthma. When allergic to dust mites, the eyes will be red, itchy and watery.\n3. Smoke\nSmoke from cigarettes and polluted environments can cause eye allergies. When exposed to smoke, the body's immune system will react by producing substances to fight this agent. A burning sensation and watery eyes are typical symptoms when the eyes are exposed to smoke.\n4. Perfume\nPerfume is made from fragrances and chemicals, some of which are harmful to health and may not be clearly listed on the packaging. Therefore, exposure to unknown ingredients and chemicals is an allergen to the eyes, respiratory system, skin, etc. It is estimated that about 2% of the world's population is allergic to fragrances. Is it in perfume? [7]\nAllergies caused by perfume can cause red, itchy or watery eyes, headaches, stuffy nose... These symptoms usually last from a few minutes to a few hours and will get worse with prolonged exposure.\n5. Pet dander\nAllergies to pets occur when a person comes into contact with hair (skin dander), saliva, or feces of pets, most commonly dogs and cats. Pet hair is inherently hypoallergenic, but can be contaminated with pollen, dust mites and mold. In addition, proteins in your pet's saliva and urine are also allergens. [8]\nWhen a person is allergic to pet dander due to inhaling dirt or coming into contact with their saliva or feces, the immune system will alert, releasing histamine and more than 40 other substances to fight against harmful agents. . Symptoms of pet allergies are similar to other types of allergies such as: swollen, red or itchy eyes, runny nose, rash, etc. Usually, these symptoms appear 15-30 minutes after exposure, or a few days if the allergy is mild.\n6. Cleaning chemicals\nDetergent chemical allergy occurs when the immune system overreacts to chemicals [9]. These substances are found in products used every day such as: hair dye, cosmetics and personal care items. Symptoms of redness, allergic eye swelling, itching, skin blistering, etc. usually appear 24-48 hours after contact with the irritant.\nPollen, a common cause of eye allergies.",
