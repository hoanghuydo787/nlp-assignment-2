Red eyes occur due to the dilation of very small blood vessels located between the sclera and the conjunctiva in the eye. These blood vessels can swell for environmental reasons such as smoke, dust, chemical exposure, etc.\n2. Tears\nInfections and allergies are common causes of watery eyes. During allergies, the body releases histamine to deal with harmful agents, thereby causing watery and itchy eyes.\n3. Sensitive to light\nPhotosensitivity is eye discomfort caused by light. Sources such as sunlight, fluorescent lights, and incandescent lights all cause patients to squint or close their eyes. Sensitivity to light is not an eye disease but a symptom of an eye infection or allergy. [11]\n4.

It can be in 1 or 2 eyes of the patient. Swollen eyelids are caused by fluid buildup or inflammation in the thin tissues surrounding the eyes (also called puffy eyes).\n7.

However, doing this accidentally causes eye damage and can cause corneal scratches. If corneal scratches are not properly treated, they will cause corneal scarring and serious vision loss.\nSome basic symptoms when feeling scratchy in the eyes:\nEyes are crusty, vision is blurred; Weep.; Feeling of stinging or pain in the eyes; The eyes turn yellow-brown, the blood vessels are clearly visible.\nSymptoms of the disease can occur in one or both eyes, accompanied by other symptoms such as: runny nose, sneezing, burning sensation, etc. To be sure whether you have an eye allergy or not, the patient should go to See a specialist for timely diagnosis and advice on treatment measures.\nSymptoms of eye allergies.",
