    "subsection_content": "Foreign bodies in the eye are the phenomenon of foreign objects falling into the eye, which can be dust, sand, insects or small objects in daily life, affecting the cornea or conjunctiva of the eye.\nThe cornea is the outer, transparent layer at the front of the eye and is also the most vulnerable part of the eye area.; The conjunctiva is a thin layer that covers the inside of the eyelids and the white part of the eye. Therefore, when a foreign object falls into the eye, it can lodge in the cornea, conjunctiva, or even penetrate the eyeball.\nDepending on the level of damage caused by foreign objects, there is appropriate treatment. Rubbing your eyes will not remove the foreign object but can cause serious eye damage such as corneal tears, infection, corneal damage, impaired vision, etc.",
