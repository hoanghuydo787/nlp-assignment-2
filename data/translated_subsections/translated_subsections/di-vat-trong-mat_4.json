    "subsection_content": "Most cases of foreign objects in the eye are mild and can heal on their own within a few days or weeks with proper care. For example, simple foreign objects such as sand or dust often only cause irritation, redness, and tearing. In this case, just wash away the foreign object with clean water and apply medication as prescribed by your doctor to prevent infection.\nHowever, in many cases where the eye is seriously damaged by a foreign object, you need to go to the hospital early for the procedure to avoid more serious illness.\nSome complications caused by foreign objects in the eye include:\nInfection and scarring: some foreign objects of plant origin can easily cause fungal ulcers on the cornea. At that time, you will waste time on treatment, often leaving complications of corneal scarring, causing vision loss.; Corneal scratches: Foreign objects can scratch the cornea, the clear membrane at the front of the eye. In some cases, a scratched cornea can easily become infected, causing serious corneal ulcers. If you know how to care for it, a corneal scratch will heal in 2 days. If left for a long time, they can lead to recurrent corneal erosion. This is a condition in which the outermost epithelial layer of the cornea is not attached to the eye, causing the patient to feel severe pain and a scratchy feeling in the eye.; Ulcers, abscesses: foreign objects causing damage to the cornea can lead to complications such as corneal ulcers and corneal perforation if not treated promptly and properly. Localized infections of the cornea can affect vision or lead to abscesses.; Damage to the eyeball: In case of a large foreign object entering the eye, it can cause injury and rupture of the eyeball. If not treated early, it will lead to blindness.; Corneal scarring: failure to treat early will cause complications of corneal scarring. This can cause some degree of permanent vision impairment.\nWarning signs of foreign objects in the eye",
