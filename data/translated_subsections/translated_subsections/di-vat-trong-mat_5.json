Remove foreign objects in your eyes at home\nIf you suspect or feel there is a foreign object in your eye, it is important to go to the Ophthalmology department for timely treatment to avoid infection and vision loss [3].\nIn case of simple foreign objects such as dust particles, sand or small debris:\nBlink quickly: when dust, hair or another small object falls into the eye, the body's natural reflex is to blink. Blinking quickly can help clear debris and allow tears to wash away the foreign object. The more you blink and get the tears flowing, the better your chances of removing the foreign object. Blink by opening and closing your eyes quickly. If you can't concentrate to make tears flow, try yawning to make tears.; Pull the upper eyelid and place it on the lower eyelid: if you want to remove a foreign object stuck under the eyelid, close your eyes and gently clamp the skin of the upper eyelid, gently pull down so that it covers the lower eyelid. Eyes rolled by foreign objects flying into them. If you're lucky, this action will help the foreign object loosen and fall out.\nFor more complicated foreign objects in the eye, you need to handle them as follows:\nWash hands with soap and water.; Try to wash the foreign object out of your eye with warm water, gently.; Take a shower, pour warm water gently on your forehead, keep your eyelids open to let the foreign object float with the water.; If you are wearing contact lenses, it is best to remove them before or during rinsing. Sometimes foreign objects can get stuck on the underside of the lens.\nIn case you help others:\nWash hands with soap and water.; Have the patient sit in a well-lit area; Gently examine the eye for foreign objects. Pull the lower eyelid and ask the person to look up.
