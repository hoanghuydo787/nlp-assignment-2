Poor response or no response can be a warning sign of nerve root compression. In addition, hot and cold stimulation may be performed to test the nerve's response to temperature changes.\nIn addition, doctors may recommend patients to perform diagnostic methods such as:\nX-ray: X-ray helps detect abnormalities in the structure of the spine and the shape of the disc bones.; CT scan: Assists doctors in determining specific images of vertebrae and disc subsidence; MRI scan: Assists doctors in determining the degree of nerve compression in the affected spinal area.\nIn addition, the doctor can check for other problems such as tumors or injuries that can lead to back pain, assisting in the diagnosis of dehydrated discs.",
