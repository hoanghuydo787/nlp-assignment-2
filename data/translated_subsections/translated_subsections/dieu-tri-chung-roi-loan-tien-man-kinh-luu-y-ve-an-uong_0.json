    "subsection_content": "Perimenopause is the stage that occurs before menopause. People also call this the menopausal transition period. Depending on each person's constitution, this period can occur at different ages. At the same time, each person will have different symptoms.\nMenopause usually falls between the ages of 45 and 55, marking the end of the reproductive process in women. In other words, when you stop having your period, you are officially in menopause.\nAssociate Professor, Dr. Luu Thi Hong said that women enter the premenopausal stage 8 - 10 years before menopause, i.e. at the age of 37 - 45. This is the active period of the brain's yellow axis system. - Pituitary gland - Ovaries decline, not producing enough female hormones: estrogen, progesterone, testosterone to meet all body activities.\nTherefore, women have to face psychological, physiological, health and beauty disturbances: risk of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disorders, decreased sexual desire, vaginal dryness, and mental irritability. Reasons why people are often angry, depressed, lack of concentration at work, hot flashes, sweating especially at night, insomnia, dizziness, headaches, nervousness, anxiety...\nDuring the final stages of perimenopause, a woman's body produces less and less estrogen. This stage lasts at least a few months and as long as 4 years.\nMenopause officially begins when the ovaries produce so little estrogen that eggs are no longer released. At that time, the menstrual cycle will stop.",
