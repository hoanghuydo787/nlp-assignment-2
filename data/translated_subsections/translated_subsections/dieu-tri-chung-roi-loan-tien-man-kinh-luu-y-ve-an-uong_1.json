There are many cases where women of this age who want to have children must seek medical intervention.\n3. Hot flashes\nA burning sensation from the chest to the shoulders, neck and face, usually lasting about 2 - 3 minutes or longer, is a common symptom of premenopausal women.

Vaginal dryness is the reason many women lose interest in sex when entering premenopause.\n9. Bone density decreases\nIf estrogen levels drop significantly, you will be at risk of losing calcium faster than other women, causing bones to become porous, weak, brittle and prone to fracture. This is the cause of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis...\nTo overcome this, you need to supplement your diet with plenty of calcium and vitamin D, and exercise regularly every day.

Improve sleep disorders by establishing a regular sleep routine, sleeping before 11 p.m., not taking too many naps (maximum 30 minutes), and not using electronic devices 2 hours before bed. If the condition still does not improve and becomes more serious, you need to talk to your doctor to find effective remedies.\n11. Heavy bleeding during menstruation\nIf suddenly, your bleeding is significantly heavier than in previous menstrual periods, it is likely that you have premenstrual disorder. But it doesn't stop there, a decrease in the hormone progesterone also causes a number of other problems, such as uterine fibroids.\n12. Memory loss\nHormonal changes, along with other perimenopausal symptoms (like mood changes and sleep disorders), can cause your memory to decline. Luckily, forgetfulness will be overcome when you enter menopause.\nAssociate Professor, Dr. Luu Thi Hong emphasized that depending on each person's constitution, symptoms may appear sooner or later. Therefore, women should listen to their bodies to identify signs early and take timely corrective measures, instead of just relying on age.",
