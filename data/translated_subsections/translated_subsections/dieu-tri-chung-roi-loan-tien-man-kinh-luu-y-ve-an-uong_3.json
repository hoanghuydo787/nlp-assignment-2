    "subsection_content": "Some people experience premenopause very gently, but some people cannot endure the series of symptoms of premenopausal disorder. According to Associate Professor, Dr. Luu Thi Hong, depending on each case, doctors prescribe treatment with medication, hormone supplementation therapy... but most women can overcome the problems of this stage with Simple solutions:\n1. About diet\nA reasonable diet helps improve symptoms of premenopausal disorders\nYou should increase protein, omega-3 fatty acids, fiber and calcium in your daily menu. Specifically:\nProtein\nDuring perimenopause, muscle mass begins to decline. Therefore, you need to increase the amount of protein in your diet because protein helps maintain muscle mass. In addition, protein also helps regulate appetite and blood sugar levels, as well as balance hormone levels in your body. Lean meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans... are good sources of protein.\nOmega-3 fatty acids\nOmega-3 fatty acids are linked to reducing inflammation, improving mood, and preventing depression. Therefore, women need to supplement fatty fish (tuna, mackerel, herring...) in their diet. Fish oil pills are also a good choice if the amount of fatty fish you provide is not enough.\nFiber\nFiber (found in vegetables, tubers, fruits, whole grains, beans...) helps you feel full longer, thereby limiting cravings and maintaining weight. This is especially helpful for premenopausal women, who are susceptible to weight gain due to a slowing metabolism.\nNot only that, fiber has also been shown to help reduce the risk of several aging diseases including heart disease, stroke and cancer.\nCalcium\nWhen the risk of osteoporosis increases, you need to increase calcium intake to 1,200mg/day. Vitamin D is also important because it helps the body absorb maximum calcium. Make friends with skimmed unsweetened milk, beans, shellfish, eggs... because these are rich sources of calcium.\nBesides the foods you should eat, there are some foods you need to limit or absolutely abstain from when entering premenopause, which are:\nFoods rich in saturated fat: animal fats, dairy products such as butter, cheese...; Foods containing highly refined carbohydrates: white bread, noodles, cakes, candy, ice cream...; Drinks containing caffeine\n2. About living regime\nA scientific lifestyle will help you repel the symptoms of premenopausal disorder. Specifically:\nDaily exercise; Stop smoking; Limiting alcohol intake; Try to give yourself a good night's sleep and get enough sleep 7-8 hours/day; Maintain a stable weight with BMI within normal limits\nPremenopausal women need to maintain exercise every day\n3. Using medicine\nIn case your premenopausal symptoms become severe, negatively affecting your quality of life, your doctor will use some types of hormone replacement (Estrogen and Progesterone supplements); endocrine treatment (including systemic or localized estrogen treatment, combined estrogen and progesterone endocrine therapy, estrogen treatment with or without progesterone...).\nHowever, which medicine to take, what dosage, how long to treat... need to be carefully considered by your doctor to avoid health risks. Therefore, women should not take medication on their own but need to go to a reputable medical facility with a gynecological department to have their health checked and have the doctor prescribe the correct medication.",
