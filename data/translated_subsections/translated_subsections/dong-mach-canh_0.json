    "subsection_content": "The carotid artery is the main artery in the neck that supplies blood to the brain, face, and neck. Each person has two common carotid arteries, located on each side of the neck, including: the left common carotid artery and the right common carotid artery.\nThe common carotid artery travels from the upper chest to the skull. Along the way, each carotid artery divides into two branches: the internal and external carotid arteries. (first)\n1. Internal carotid artery\nThe internal carotid arteries begin at a bifurcation on either side of the neck, passing through the neck until reaching the base of the skull. Each internal carotid artery then passes through an opening in the skull, called the carotid canal. This is an anatomical landmark that separates the extracranial (outside the skull) and intracranial (inside the skull) portions of the artery. Once inside the skull, the internal carotid artery follows a tortuous, tortuous path.\nEach internal carotid artery gives off several branches inside the skull. These arteries supply blood to the brain and eyes. Branches include: ophthalmic artery, posterior communicating artery, anterior cerebral artery, and middle cerebral artery.\n2. External carotid artery\nThe external carotid arteries begin at the bifurcation on either side of the neck. Each external carotid artery travels up along the side of the neck toward the ear. The segment near the ear divides into two branches: the maxillary artery and the superficial temporal artery.\nEach external carotid artery has 8 branches, supplying blood to many structures in the neck and face. These branches include: superior thyroid artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, lingual artery, facial artery, occipital artery, posterior atrioventricular artery, maxillary artery, and superficial temporal artery.\nThe internal and external carotid arteries give rise to many smaller arterial branches that carry blood throughout the head and neck, nourishing organs and tissues.",
