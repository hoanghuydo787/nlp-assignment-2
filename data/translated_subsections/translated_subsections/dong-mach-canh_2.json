    "subsection_content": "Like the arteries that supply blood to the heart, the carotid arteries can also develop atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries within the vessel. This reduces blood flow to the brain and increases the risk of stroke. (3)\nA stroke is similar to a heart attack, occurring when blood flow is cut off from part of the brain. If anemia lasts more than 3-6 hours, the damage is usually permanent. A stroke can happen if:\nSeverely narrowed arteries; An artery to the brain ruptures due to atherosclerosis; A piece of plaque breaks off and travels to the brain's smaller arteries; Forms blood clots and clogs blood vessels\nCarotid atherosclerosis is one of the risk factors for stroke.\nStroke can occur due to conditions other than carotid artery disease. For example, sudden bleeding in the brain (cerebral hemorrhage) can cause a stroke. Other causes may include:\nAtrial fibrillation; Cardiomyopathy; Hypertension; Hemorrhage in the spinal fluid cavity; Blockage of small arteries inside the brain\nWhat are the risk factors for the disease? The same goes for other cardiovascular diseases, including:\nHypertension; Age; Smoke; Abnormal lipids or high cholesterol; Insulin resistance; Diabetes; Fat; Sedentary lifestyle; Family history of atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, or carotid artery disease\nMen under 75 years old are at higher risk of the disease than women in the same age group. Women are at higher risk than men over 75 years old. People with coronary artery disease have a higher risk of developing the disease.",
