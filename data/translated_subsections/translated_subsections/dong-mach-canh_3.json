    "subsection_content": "Carotid artery disease often has no symptoms until you have a transient ischemic attack or stroke. That's why it's important to have regular screening and doctor visits to check for carotid artery abnormalities so they can be treated promptly.\nListening for a neck murmur is a simple, safe way to screen for carotid stenosis, although it may not detect all blockages. The doctor examines and listens to the arteries in the patient's neck with a stethoscope. If an abnormal sound (called a murmur) occurs in an artery, this may reflect turbulent blood flow and indicate carotid artery disease. Some experts believe that murmurs may be a greater predictor of atherosclerosis than stroke risk.\nYour doctor may also use several methods to diagnose the disease, including:\nCarotid ultrasound (standard or Doppler): This is the first step of non-invasive, painless screening. This method uses high-frequency sound waves to view the carotid arteries; helps look for plaque and blood clots, determining whether arteries are narrowed or blocked. Doppler ultrasound shows the movement of blood through the arteries. Ultrasound images do not use X-rays, so they are safe for patients.; Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA): This imaging technique aims to gather precise information about the brain and arteries. A computer then uses this information to create high-resolution images. MRA can often detect signs of stroke.; Computed tomography angiography (CTA): A CT scan uses X-rays and computer technology to create cross-sectional images of the carotid arteries. Images of the brain may also be collected. With this imaging technique, the scan can reveal areas of damage on the brain. CT scans use low levels of radiation.; Cerebral angiography (carotid angiography): This procedure is considered the gold standard for carotid artery angioplasty. This is an invasive procedure that allows doctors to see blood flow through the carotid arteries in real time. A cerebral angiogram will show narrowing or blockage when contrast dye is injected into the carotid artery.\nComputed tomography angiography is one of the methods to diagnose the disease.",
