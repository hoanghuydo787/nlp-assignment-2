    "subsection_content": "The carotid arteries carry blood to the brain, face, and head. When healthy, these arteries are smooth and wide open, like a clean pipe allowing fluid to flow freely without anything obstructing it. The body's circulatory system is a network of tubes that carry blood (containing nutrients and oxygen) to all parts of the body. (4)\nCarotid stenosis occurs when the carotid arteries (large arteries on either side of the neck) become blocked. The blockage is made up of a substance called plaque (fatty cholesterol deposits). When plaque blocks the normal flow of blood through the carotid artery, a person has a higher risk of having a stroke. Plaque buildup is called atherosclerosis.\nPatients may have carotid artery stenosis in one of the two arteries in the neck or in both. This condition can get worse over time without medical attention, leading to stroke and other serious complications that can lead to death.\nThe incidence of this disease in the general population is estimated to be 5%. According to the American Stroke Association, stroke ranks fifth on the list of fatal diseases. Stenosis usually occurs over time, and as you age, your risk of this condition and stroke increases.",
