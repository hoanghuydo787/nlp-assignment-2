The specific treatment depends on the degree of blockage in the carotid artery.\nIf the congestion is mild to moderate, your doctor recommends:\nLifestyle changes to slow the progression of atherosclerosis. Recommendations include: quit smoking, lose weight, reduce salt, eat healthy foods and exercise regularly.; Use medicine to control blood pressure or lower cholesterol. Your doctor may also recommend daily aspirin or other blood thinners to prevent blood clots.\nIf the blockage is severe or if you have had a transient ischemic attack or stroke, your doctor may perform intervention to remove the blockage and revascularize the carotid artery. Methods include:\nCarotid endarterectomy: This is the most common treatment for severe carotid artery disease. After making an incision along the front of the neck, the surgeon will open the affected carotid artery and remove the plaque. The artery is repaired by suturing or grafting.; Carotid artery angioplasty and stenting: If it is difficult to reach the blockage with carotid endarterectomy or the patient has other health conditions that make surgery risky, the doctor will choose an interventional option. by placing a stent. Accordingly, the patient is given local anesthesia and a small balloon is inserted using a catheter into the blockage area. The balloon is inflated to widen the artery and a small wire mesh coil (stent) is inserted to keep the artery from narrowing again.",
