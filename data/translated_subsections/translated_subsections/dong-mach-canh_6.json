    "subsection_content": "To prevent or slow the progression of carotid artery disease, patients can apply the following measures:\nDon't smoke: Within a few years of quitting smoking, a former smoker's risk of stroke is similar to that of a non-smoker.; Maintain a healthy weight: Prevent other risk factors such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and sleep apnea.; Limit cholesterol and fat: In particular, cutting down on saturated fat can reduce the accumulation of plaque in the arteries.; Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables: Provides many nutrients such as potassium, folate and antioxidants, which can protect against transient anemia or stroke.; Salt restriction: Excess salt (sodium) can increase blood pressure in people who are sensitive to sodium. Experts recommend that healthy adults should eat less than 1.5g of salt/day; Regular exercise: Can help stabilize blood pressure, increase the density of HDL - good cholesterol and improve the overall health of blood vessels and heart. This also helps with weight loss, diabetes control and stress reduction.; Limit alcohol; Control chronic diseases: Manage diabetes and hypertension well, help protect arteries, including the carotid artery.\nInvested in modern machinery systems such as advanced 4D cardiac and vascular ultrasound machines, 1.5 - 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging machines, 768-slice cardiac MSCT imaging machines, digital erasing interventional angiography systems DSA platform with 360-degree rotating robot arm..., Tam Anh General Hospital Cardiovascular Center comprehensively and in-depth diagnoses and treats carotid artery disease and cardiovascular diseases (congenital heart disease, hypertension, coronary artery disease , heart valve disease, myocardial ischemia...) for all subjects.\nThe treatment regimen is developed individually according to the guidelines of the world and domestic Cardiovascular Associations, bringing high efficiency.\nTo schedule an examination, screening and treatment for carotid artery disease and cardiovascular diseases at the Heart Center, Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nCarotid artery stenosis is the cause of about 10-20% of strokes, causing serious complications for patients, even life-threatening. Screening, early detection and timely intervention can help control risk factors for carotid artery disease and prevent stroke.",
