    "subsection_content": "Ischemic stroke is a condition that occurs when a blood clot blocks a blood vessel or narrows a blood vessel in the brain, blocking blood circulation to the brain. Ischemia in the brain will cause brain cells to die massively due to lack of oxygen and nutrients. If prolonged, it will cause brain tissue necrosis, then brain edema may appear in the next 2 to 4 days.\nIt is estimated that if blood flow to the brain stops for about 10 seconds, brain tissue metabolic disorders will begin to occur. If brain tissue metabolic disorder lasts for a few minutes, millions of brain cells will die. Therefore, ischemic stroke is a condition that requires intervention as soon as possible. (2)\nIschemic stroke is a dangerous disease that can occur at any age",
