    "subsection_content": "Ischemic stroke is divided into 2 main types, including:\nThrombotic stroke\nThrombotic stroke is a condition in which blood flow in the brain's blood vessels is suddenly stopped due to a blood clot forming in the cerebral artery. Thrombotic strokes are common in older people, especially those with high blood cholesterol, atherosclerosis (a buildup of fat and lipids inside the walls of blood vessels), or diabetes. Warning symptoms of thrombotic stroke can occur in the early morning or while the patient is sleeping.\nBefore a thrombotic stroke occurs, the patient may experience transient ischemic attacks (TIA). These transient ischemic attacks can last for a few minutes and up to 24 hours. Specific manifestations of TIA are similar to stroke symptoms such as double vision, dizziness, weakness on one side of the body, headache, etc. but at a milder level and appear transiently.\nEmbolic stroke (embolic stroke)\nEmbolic stroke is a condition in which blood flow to the brain is blocked by a blood clot forming anywhere in the patient's body. Statistics show that about 15% of embolic strokes occur in people with atrial fibrillation, a type of abnormal heart rhythm because the upper chamber of the heart does not beat effectively.\nSee more: Types of stroke: How to distinguish common types today.",
