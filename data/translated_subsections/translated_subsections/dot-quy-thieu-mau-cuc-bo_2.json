    "subsection_content": "Determining the correct cause of ischemic stroke will help doctors quickly provide effective emergency stroke intervention. Below are common causes and risk factors for ischemic stroke, including: (3)\nCommon causes of ischemic stroke\nLarge atherosclerosis: Large atherosclerotic plaques accumulate in the arteries, causing embolism or blockage of blood vessels in several locations in the body, including the brain.; Cardiac embolism: Blood clots formed in the heart are one of the causes of embolism and stroke. The risk of forming thrombus in the heart also comes from cardiovascular diseases, typically ischemic heart valve disease, atrial fibrillation, patent foramen ovale.; Lacunar infarction: This is a type of cerebral infarction located under the cerebral cortex, relatively small in size, accounting for about 25% of cases of cerebral infarction. Lacunar infarction is often found in gray cerebral nuclei located deep in the brain such as the thalamus, pons, basal ganglia,...; Other causes: Some other causes of ischemic stroke include acute/chronic meningitis, intra-aortic and intracranial arterial dissection, hyperactivity, hyperviscosity disorders in the blood (such as thrombocytosis, polycythemia, plasma cell disorders, etc.), other rare diseases (Binswanger's disease, Moyamoya disease, fibromuscular dysplasia, etc.); Unable to determine the cause: Medical statistics show that there are some cases of ischemic stroke whose cause cannot be found even though the patient has been examined and paraclinical tests have been performed.\nRisk factors that can lead to ischemic stroke\nSuffering from hypertension, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, vasculitis, etc.; Addicted to tobacco, alcohol; Unscientific diet (eating foods that cause excess energy, lots of saturated fat, etc.); Unscientific lifestyle, lack of exercise; Side effects of exogenous estrogen.; Old age (over 50 years old). However, the rate of young people having strokes is also increasing.",
