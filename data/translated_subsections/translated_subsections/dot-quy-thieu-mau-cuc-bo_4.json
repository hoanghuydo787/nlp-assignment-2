If not detected and treated promptly, stroke will lead to dangerous complications affecting many important organs in the body, including:\nNervous system damage: Ischemic stroke causes many serious complications in the patient's nervous system. People who have had a stroke may lose the ability to perceive pain, lose the feeling of cold/heat, or experience impaired vision and difficulty speaking. In addition, stroke can cause other damage to the nervous system, including: dementia, memory loss, inability to control emotions (easy anger, sadness, etc.), depression .; Damage to the muscular system: Ischemic stroke will often cause reduced mobility of some parts of the body or weakness of one side of the body, weakness of the whole body.; Damage to the respiratory system: Brain damage caused by an ischemic stroke can seriously affect the patient's respiratory function, causing the patient to have difficulty breathing or stop breathing. This is also a common complication but can be improved when the patient receives timely emergency stroke treatment within the \"golden\" time (3-6 hours, can be extended to 24 hours from the stroke onset). .; Damage to the circulatory system: This is a common complication in people who have ischemic stroke due to alcohol and tobacco abuse or have high blood pressure or diabetes.; Damage to the digestive system: Some drugs used in stroke treatment can cause side effects that affect the digestive system such as constipation, slow digestion of food, etc. In addition, if a stroke Stroke causes damage to the brain area that controls digestive activities, causing loss or limitation of intestinal function.; Damage to the urinary system: Ischemic stroke can seriously affect the connection between the brain and urinary system, in which the bladder is the most severely affected part. Some complications caused by stroke in the urinary system include: loss of urinary control, frequent urination during the day, urination while sleeping, etc.; Damage to the reproductive system: Although it does not directly affect the reproductive organs, ischemic stroke can cause the patient to reduce sexual desire.
