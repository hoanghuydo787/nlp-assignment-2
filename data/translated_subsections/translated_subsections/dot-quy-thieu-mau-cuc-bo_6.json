    "subsection_content": "The goal of ischemic stroke treatment is to restore blood flow to the affected brain area. When cerebral blood circulation is restored promptly, it will help limit brain tissue damage. At the Neurological Center, Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City deploys a variety of modern techniques to help treat strokes in the golden time with high efficiency and speed. Depending on each specific case, stroke emergency techniques will include the following. (5)\nEmergency treatment methods for ischemic stroke\nUse fibrinolytic drugs\nThis is a necessary treatment option during the first 3 to 4.5 hours of stroke onset (can be extended to the first 6 hours). Thrombolytic drugs have the effect of re-opening clogged blood vessels, thereby helping to reduce the risk of disability and increase the ability to restore body function for people with stroke.\nCurrently, intravenous injection of fibrinolytic drugs is the preferred method in treating ischemic stroke with a recovery rate of up to 80%. With this method, the doctor will inject fibrinolytic drugs into the patient's veins. In just about 1 hour, the small blood clot causing blockage in the brain will be broken and the blood flow to the brain will be restored. again. At that time, the patient's vital functions, language functions, sensory functions, and motor functions will gradually be restored.\nRemove thrombus using mechanical tools\nThis is a technique that helps remove large blood clots from the patient's cerebral blood vessels using a catheter under the guidance of a DSA digital subtraction angiography machine. Among them, two highly effective mechanical thrombectomy devices are the penumbra thrombectomy system and the Solitaire stent. To perform thrombectomy with mechanical tools, the doctor will insert a catheter into the blood vessel, then thread the catheter to the location of the blood clot in the cerebral blood vessel and remove them. This stroke emergency intervention technique is often applied during the \"golden\" time frame, from the first 6 to 24 hours after a stroke occurs.\nAt Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, the Stroke Emergency Center has successfully treated many stroke cases during golden hours, thanks to the application of modern techniques and machines to help identify diseases and administer medication. Thrombolysis and blood clot removal quickly and accurately.\nOther methods help support the treatment of ischemic stroke\nHypothermia of the patient\nWhen body temperature suddenly increases, brain cells are at risk of dying. Controlling the patient's body temperature to a stable level will help protect brain tissue from stroke-related damage.\nControl blood sugar levels\nBrain cells need glucose (a type of sugar) to feed brain tissue. Too little glucose in the blood will slow down brain recovery, however, too much glucose in the blood can also negatively affect the brain cells' ability to repair themselves.\nUse blood thinners\nThis is a medication that helps blood flow better in the arteries and veins by keeping blood clots from increasing in size. Using blood thinners as prescribed by your doctor can effectively support the treatment of ischemic stroke caused by thrombosis.\nProvide oxygen promptly\nIschemic stroke will suddenly reduce the amount of oxygen available in the blood, leading to a serious lack of oxygen to the brain. Providing oxygen in time will help supplement oxygen to the brain, maintaining the life of brain cells.",
