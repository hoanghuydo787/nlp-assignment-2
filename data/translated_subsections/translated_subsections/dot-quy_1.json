According to statistics, currently about 85% of stroke cases belong to this group. However, in many cases the exact cause of this condition has not yet been found.\n2.1.1. Thromboembolic stroke\nOne of the next most common causes of stroke is thrombosis of atherosclerotic plaques inside the vessel wall, which can progress to gradually narrow the vessel lumen. These lesions can lead to abnormal platelet aggregation at the site of stenosis, causing the vessel lumen to become completely blocked. As a result, part of the brain lacks blood supply, leading to a stroke due to local ischemia.\n2.1.2. Embolic stroke\nThe artery is blocked by a clot from somewhere else, causing the vessel to fill. This thrombus can form from the heart or from atherosclerotic plaque peeling off. This type of stroke is called an embolic stroke.\nAbout 85% of strokes are due to ischemia\n2.2. Stroke due to cerebral hemorrhage\nCerebral hemorrhage (bleeding) is caused by rupture of a cerebral blood vessel causing bleeding into the brain parenchyma, subarachnoid space or ventricle. About 15% of current stroke cases are due to brain hemorrhage.",
