    "subsection_content": "1. Does bathing at night lead to stroke? Is stroke caused by late-night bathing?\nARE NOT. Bathing at night is not a direct cause of stroke but will be an indirect catalyst and promoting factor. Therefore, you should not bathe at night, especially after 11 p.m. Because this is the time when the temperature drops to its lowest during the day, and blood pressure rises at the same time. Changes in body temperature, status and blood pressure will affect blood circulation, blood vessels will constrict and can easily cause cerebral ischemia, leading to stroke.\n2. Why are strokes getting younger and younger?\nYoung people today have an unscientific lifestyle in diet and activities such as drinking a lot of alcohol, smoking, using stimulants, and being sedentary, increasing the risk of blood fats, obesity, and cholesterol levels. too high. In addition, more and more young people are suffering from cardiovascular diseases and high blood pressure - two leading causes of stroke. (3)\n3. What is the truth about the one-legged standing challenge to diagnose stroke?\nThis challenge originated from a study in Japan in 2014. However, this study was only surveyed in a small group of subjects over the age of 60 and with underlying diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. pressure. Therefore, this study and the one-legged standing challenge to diagnose stroke need to be retested with a more diverse and expanded group of subjects. To have an accurate diagnosis of stroke, patients need to be examined and have specialized laboratory tests and orders performed, especially screening for underlying diseases.\n4. Is stroke hereditary?\nStroke is not a genetic disease. However, the causes of stroke such as high blood pressure, diabetes, blood lipid disorders, etc. often have family factors. Therefore, in families where someone has had a stroke, their relatives are also at higher risk of getting the disease.\n5.

This is also the second highest cause of death in the world, on average there is 1 death due to stroke every 6 seconds and 1 in every 6 people has a stroke.\nHowever, not all strokes lead to death. If people with stroke are detected and intervened promptly at the first signs or are screened and diagnosed to take preventive measures from the beginning, the risk of death or complications can be limited. danger.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment with leading experts at the Department of Neurology, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\nThe most effective method to help prevent dangerous complications of stroke is for patients to receive early detection and timely emergency treatment. For example, at Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, unclogging techniques are being applied to provide emergency treatment for stroke patients right in the \"golden hour\", helping to increase the survival rate and limit complications for patients. sick.
