Depending on the time a person with a stroke is detected, taken to the hospital and treated, the degree of damage to the nervous system will vary.\nWhen you have a stroke, the longer you delay emergency treatment, the more severely damaged the nervous system will be, causing serious consequences, long recovery time, and even irreversibility.

In some cases, complications can even cause permanent damage.\nSome common complications after a stroke include:\nParalysis (one arm, one hand or all four limbs);; Weak mobility, difficulty moving arms and legs;; Loss of speech, slurred speech, difficulty in communication;; Having vision problems;; Psychological problems such as depression, emotional disorders, etc.;; Severe cases will lead to death or vegetative state.\nPeople who have had a stroke are at high risk of losing mobility",
