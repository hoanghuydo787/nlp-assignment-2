    "subsection_content": "1. According to morphology and location\nCataracts: Cataracts occur when the hardening and yellowing of the lens nucleus exceeds the central area. This is called cataracts. In the early stages, these two factors cause some refractive errors of the eye, leading to symptoms such as blurred distance vision. Cataracts can occur in one eye.; Shell perforation: This type of shell perforation can enlarge and merge with each other to form larger shell perforation areas. When the entire shell from the capsule to the nucleus becomes white opaque (the lens is completely opaque), it is called mature opacification. This condition occurs in both eyes and is often asymmetrical.; Capsule opacification: A small opacification in the epithelium and anterior capsule of the lens but does not affect the capsule.\n2. Classify by level\nCataract pathology (dry cataracts) is divided into 4 levels: initial cataract, progressive cataract, nearly complete cataract and complete cataract.\nRegardless of the type of cloudy lens (except trauma), basically, the cloudy condition is usually due to the structure and ratio of protein molecules being changed, creating opaque areas in the lens, preventing light reaches the retina and causes vision loss.",
