    "subsection_content": "Curved penis is a benign disease. The disease is caused by fibrous plaques or hardened lumps that develop between the two layers of the erectile tissue in the penis (cavernosus), causing contraction and adhesion. This causes the penis to curve and deform when erect. (first)\nIf fibrous plaque develops on the back of the penis, it will cause the penis to curve upward. Meanwhile, fibrous plaques that develop on the ventral surface of the penis will cause the penis to curve downwards. In some cases, fibrous plaques develop on both sides, causing the penis to become concave and shortened.",
