    "subsection_content": "Peyronie's disease: This is a condition in which scar tissue appears on the penis, causing the penis to curve up, down, to the left or to the right when erect, depending on the location of the scar. The patient's penis can curve at an angle from 15째 to more than 90째.; Congenital: Curvature of the penis is influenced by genetic factors. Men who have a relative with a curved penis are at very high risk of developing this condition.; Penile fracture (broken corpus cavernosum): This is an objective cause of penile curvature. Accidents in traffic, work, and daily life can cause damage to the penis. Due to direct impact from external forces, the penis can bend or even break.; Connective tissue disorders: Men with connective tissue disorders are more likely to face penile curvature.; Excessive sex: Men who have sex too much, in the wrong position, especially using stimulants and have rough behavior during intercourse can cause damage to the penis. The penis can bleed, hematoma, and over time form fibrous plaques. Fibrous plaque clinging to the penis will cause the penis to curve when erect.",
