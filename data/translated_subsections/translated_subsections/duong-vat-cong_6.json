Some cases of the disease can be cured without medical intervention. Non-surgical methods to treat penile curvature include:\nUse anti-inflammatory drugs like corticosteroids and vitamin E combined with pain relief if the patient feels a lot of pain and affects daily activities.; Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT): This is a targeted treatment. The doctor will use an ultrasound scanner to shine directly on the tumor area or protruding patches on the penis. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy has high safety and effectiveness, which still needs to be thoroughly evaluated.\n2. Surgical treatment methods\nSurgery is often indicated for more serious cases. Indications are usually people with a severely curved penis, pain or affecting sexual ability. Doctors often ask patients to continue monitoring for at least 12 months before deciding on surgery. Because in many cases, the disease can be improved without treatment.\nThe purpose of surgery is to straighten the penis by:\nCut tumors, graft skin or connect veins; Implantation of a straightening device into the penis; Apply pressure to the area opposite the penis site where the tumor is located to prevent the penis from bending. This method can change the size of the penis.",
