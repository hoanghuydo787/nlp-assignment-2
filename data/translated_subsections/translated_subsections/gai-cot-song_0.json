The ligaments that stabilize the bones also become loose. In efforts to combat this aging process, the body creates bone spurs, which are bony growths that extend outward and to the sides of the spine to maintain stability and reduce stress. straighten the spine, over time it will form spinal spurs. This is one of the complications of degenerative spine disease.\nSpinal spurs can occur anywhere on the spine, but often form in parts of the body that are subject to a lot of pressure such as the cervical vertebrae and lumbar vertebrae.
