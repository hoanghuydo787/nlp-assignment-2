Spinal degeneration causes joint cartilage to erode and crack easily. As soon as the body notices this abnormality, the \"calcium replenishment\" state is immediately initiated. However, the accretion will take place unevenly, causing a situation of insufficient space. Areas lacking calcium will form bone hollows, while areas with excess calcium cause roughness and over time create bone spurs.; Chronic spinal arthritis: is the phenomenon of two bone surfaces contacting and rubbing against each other. To overcome this phenomenon, the body will adjust itself to reduce pressure and friction. The result of this adjustment process will affect the entire spinal joint, causing the vertebrae to become fibrotic. grow thorns.; Calcium deposition: Often occurs in ligaments and tendons in contact with the vertebrae due to the aging process.; Genetic factors: Many people are born with genes that make their discs weaker than normal. This is the reason why the disease is getting younger and younger as many people have developed thorns at a very young age. If there are many people in the family with spinal bone spurs, the genetic possibility of the disease is greater.; Injury: Injuries can cause disc herniation.
