In addition, tests that need to be performed to confirm a diagnosis include:\nBlood tests: Blood tests check levels of certain substances that may indicate rheumatoid arthritis or other conditions as a cause of spondylosis.; CT scan: To determine the location, condition and extent of bone involvement, the extent of joint changes and bone spur formation.; Electromyography (EMG): This test is used to evaluate and measure the speed at which nerves send electrical signals to the brain. During this test, small, thin needles are placed into the muscles of the arms and legs to record electrical activity and show the extent of spinal nerve injury.; Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): Magnetic resonance imaging is mainly used to determine the extent of damage to the cartilage disc and compression of the spinal nerves.; Myelogram: This is a special type of CT scan. During this procedure, contrast dye is injected into the spinal canal, making the spinal cord and nerve roots more clearly visible, thereby making it easier to determine the extent of damage.; X-ray: This is a common imaging test to detect bone spurs and the degree of nerve compression.",
