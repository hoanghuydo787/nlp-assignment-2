    "subsection_content": "Nothing can prevent the body from aging. Spinal spurs are a natural aging process, so there is no treatment that can reverse this principle. To date, treatment of spondylosis mainly focuses on three main methods. The first is to use medicine to relieve immediate pain. The second is chiropractic exercise and therapy. Surgery is the last resort and should only be considered in cases where the bone spurs are too large.\nAccording to Dr. Tang Ha Nam Anh, the earlier spinal spurs are detected, the higher the chance of cure. People aged 30 and over should regularly have their spine checked to detect disease early if any. For effective treatment, patients need to closely follow the specialist's treatment regimen. In addition, it is necessary to change living habits, regularly exercise and sports appropriate to your physical condition, and have a reasonable diet to help the disc recover quickly.\n1. Non-drug treatment\nIf the disease does not cause pain, treatment is not necessary. Treatments are only used when symptoms occur or cause serious complications. Treatment is mainly symptomatic, slowing down the process of spinal degeneration, helping patients live with the disease more comfortably.\nSpinal stenosis treatment can be combined with regular rehabilitation exercises, massage, physical therapy with infrared, shortwave, electroshock... which also bring positive results.\n2. Medical treatment\nIf the disease causes pain, the patient needs to rest and take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory pain relievers and muscle relaxants. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective in reducing back and neck pain caused by spondylosis. Some medications such as ibuprofen and naproxen, acetaminophen and tramadol also work against pain. Muscle relaxants such as cyclobenzaprine and tizanidine have been suggested to reduce muscle spasms associated with spina bifida.\nIn addition to medication, it should be combined with acupuncture, physical therapy, and regular exercise. Improve a healthy lifestyle such as stopping smoking, losing weight, having a diet rich in calcium and lots of green vegetables... Do not do heavy work, limit travel, sleep with a hard mattress, do not use pillows or use special pillows...\n3. Surgery\nSurgery is the last method considered in cases where there is compression of the spinal cord, narrowing of the spinal canal or compression of the nervous system, causing numbness in the legs and arms, and bowel and bladder disorders. After surgery, bone spurs can grow back in the same location, so patients need to maintain a healthy lifestyle and pay attention to posture when studying and working to limit the risk of recurrence. In particular, it is necessary to comply with treatment and have regular follow-up examinations to detect and promptly treat bad developments.",
