    "subsection_content": "1. Should people with spondylosis take calcium?\nCalcium is an active ingredient that plays an important role in nourishing and restoring damage to the vertebrae. If there is a calcium deficiency, new bone cells will not be formed. Although the cause of spinal spurs is calcium deposition, that does not mean these people abstain from calcium supplementation. Calcium supplementation will help bone damage recover, limiting degeneration and pain.\n2. Should people with spinal spurs exercise at the gym?\nPatients can still exercise normally at the gym. However, exercises need to be properly designed and suitable for your physical condition to support disease treatment and prevent risks from arising. Do not exercise at high intensity, heavy exercises are at risk of making the disease worse.\n3. Are spinal spurs and disc herniation the same?\nARE NOT. Both are forms of osteoarthritis in the spine, but spinal spurs and disc herniation are two different conditions. While disc herniation is a condition in which the nucleus pulposus of the spinal disc escapes from its normal position, pressing on the spinal canal or nerve roots, spondylosis is a degenerative disease of the joints in the spine, forming bone spurs on the outside or on either side of the spine.\nSpinal spurs are no longer a disease of old age. In addition to age and genetic factors, mistakes in living, working and participating in physical activities are the reasons why this disease is increasingly common. more common in young people.",
