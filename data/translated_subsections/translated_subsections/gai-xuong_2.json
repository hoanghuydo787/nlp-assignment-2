    "subsection_content": "Depending on the location of formation, bone spurs are classified by experts into many different groups, such as:\n1. Vertebrae\nExtra bone structures that grow outward and along both sides of the vertebral body are called vertebral spines. They can cause back or neck pain by:\nCauses the vertebrae to rub against each other during back and neck movements and leads to arthritis; Compresses nerve roots and causes paresthesia (tingling) accompanied by neck and back pain; Growing into the spinal canal, compressing the spinal cord leads to weakness, muscle weakness, pain and many other unpleasant symptoms.\n2. Knee spurs\nWhen the articular cartilage layer in the knee is damaged leading to erosion (knee osteoarthritis), the bone ends here will become irritated and inflamed due to increased pressure and friction in the knee joint as this part performs its functions. Daily functions (flexing and extending legs, supporting body weight...).\nAt that time, bone cells will respond by forming bone spurs to help protect the knee joint. However, too many or overdeveloped knee joint spurs will cause joint deformity and limit joint movement.\n3. Heel spurs\nHeel spurs are bone spurs that form on the heel bone due to long-term calcium deposition there. These spikes tend to \"grow\" toward the arch of the foot, and often appear in people with plantar fasciitis. The development of heel spurs can cause patients to feel pain with every step.\n4. Hip spurs\nDegeneration of the hip joint also leads to bone spurs developing in this part. Some patients may not have obvious symptoms for many years. However, unpleasant symptoms such as pain, stiffness and reduced range of motion are unavoidable if the spines have developed and pressed on the surrounding soft tissues.",
