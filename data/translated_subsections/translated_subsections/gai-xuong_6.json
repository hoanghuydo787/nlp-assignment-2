After being injected into the joint, steroids have the effect of temporarily reducing inflammation here and the surrounding area, thereby helping to reduce pain and stiffness.

Consulting with physical therapists can help patients build an effective exercise program with appropriate exercises such as:\nStretching muscles, tendons, joint capsules; Appropriate living and working posture, not harmful to bones and joints; Strengthening muscle groups around joints helps support movement and reduce the load on damaged joints\nPay attention to rest\nPhysical exercise can help strengthen muscle strength and improve joint function and flexibility, but too much exercise will be counterproductive.
