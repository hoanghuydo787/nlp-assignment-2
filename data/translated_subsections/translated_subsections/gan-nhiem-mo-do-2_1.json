    "subsection_content": "Grade 2 fatty liver often originates from some of the common causes below:\nAlcoholic beverages: Beer, especially alcohol, when entering the body, will increase the amount of free fatty acids while disrupting the liver's fat oxidation process. In addition, alcoholic beverages also destroy lipids as well as increase the level of triglycerides (blood fat index) accumulated in the liver. This is considered the leading cause of fatty liver; Alcoholic beverages: Beer, especially alcohol, when entering the body, will increase the amount of free fatty acids while disrupting the liver's fat oxidation process.

If this problem lasts for a long time, it will increase the amount of fat accumulated in the liver.\nHigh/low blood sugar: People with diabetes are at risk of fatty liver - higher than healthy people. The reason is that when blood sugar increases, it will partially reduce the liver's ability to remove \"bad\" LDL cholesterol. Over time, this causes the liver to accumulate more cholesterol and lead to fatty liver disease. On the contrary, when blood sugar drops low (for example due to fasting), the body will have to release a certain amount to compensate for energy - if it is high and frequent, it will also increase the amount of fat in the liver. ; High/low blood sugar: People with diabetes are at risk of fatty liver - higher than healthy people.
