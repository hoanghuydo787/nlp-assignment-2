    "subsection_content": "Dr. Vu Truong Khanh, head of the Department of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreas, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, said that fatty liver is a condition of fat accumulation in liver cells. When there is simple fatty liver without inflammation, it does not progress to chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Fatty liver that causes inflammation in the liver is called fatty liver disease.\nFatty liver disease can occur due to alcohol and non-alcoholic causes, also known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NAFLD). About 30% of people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease will have hepatitis, leading to chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. On ultrasound, fatty liver can be divided into grade I, II or III, but the severity and danger of fatty liver are not commensurate with the severity on ultrasound. In the early stages, fatty liver disease usually does not affect liver function much, but over time, the disease will become more and more serious and lead to many dangerous complications.(1)",
