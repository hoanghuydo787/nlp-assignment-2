Therefore, the best way to prevent this disease is to limit alcohol and when hepatitis is present, then Absolutely do not drink alcohol. (3)\n1. Hepatitis\nThis complication occurs when more and more fat covers liver cells, impairing liver function. Liver disease will progress quickly when you have hepatitis B or C virus and drink a lot of alcohol.\nTypical signs when the disease develops to this stage are loss of appetite and fatigue, but there are not always clear symptoms.\n2. Cirrhosis\nThis is the main complication of fatty liver disease. When the liver tries to stop ongoing damage, such as inflammation, it creates areas of scarring (fibrosis). If hepatitis does not stop, the fibrosis process will continue to spread.\n3. Liver cancer\nFatty liver disease silently progresses and gets worse, which can lead to complications of cirrhosis and, most dangerously, complications of liver cancer. This is a consequence of hepatitis due to long-term fatty liver.",
