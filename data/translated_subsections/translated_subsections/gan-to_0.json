    "subsection_content": "Hepatomegaly is a condition in which the liver size increases compared to its normal size. According to research in the Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine, the average liver size of people 18 - 66 years old is about 13.6 -15 cm in diameter.\nInstead of being a disease, hepatomegaly is a symptom of many diseases. Usually it is a warning sign of a type of liver disease, causing the liver to swell with inflammation. Sometimes it is a sign of diseases in your blood or heart such as congestive heart failure.\nDr. Vu Truong Khanh, Head of the Department of Gastroenterology - Hepatobiliary - Pancreas, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, said that hepatomegaly can be detected during clinical examination but depends on the subjectivity of the physician. Ultrasound is the simplest and most objective method that can help doctors determine the size of the liver. An enlarged liver is often a warning sign that the liver may be diseased even though its function is still normal. Large liver size combined with accompanying symptoms helps doctors accurately diagnose the health condition or disease that the patient is suffering from.",
