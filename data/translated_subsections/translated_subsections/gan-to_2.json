    "subsection_content": "1. Acute viral hepatitis\nThis is a viral or bacterial infection that causes a high risk of inflammation and liver damage. Inflammation is a swelling that occurs when the body's tissues are injured or infected with viruses. Inflammation can damage organs. Researchers have discovered several different viruses with external links that cause hepatitis, including hepatitis A, B, C, D and E. An enlarged liver is among the condition's symptoms. Acute viral hepatitis.\n2. Alcoholic hepatitis\nDrinking too much alcohol can lead to a buildup of fat cells in the liver, also known as fatty liver. The process of fat accumulation inside liver cells causes the liver to enlarge, causing discomfort in the upper right abdomen. This condition can interfere with your ability to perform important functions. In some severe cases, alcoholic hepatitis can lead to severe liver scarring or cirrhosis, causing the liver to become enlarged.\n3. Cirrhosis\nCirrhosis often occurs in the late stages of fatty liver disease.\nCirrhosis is a condition of severe liver fibrosis, whereby the liver becomes scarred or fibrotic. Cirrhosis occurs in the late stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and other conditions related to liver damage. When cirrhosis causes an enlarged liver, it is usually due to alcoholic cirrhosis, cirrhosis due to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis due to heart failure. Cirrhosis caused by viral hepatitis B and C is atrophic cirrhosis, so when cirrhosis occurs, the liver shrinks.\n4. Fatty liver not caused by alcohol\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease is quite common in people who are overweight, have hyperlipidemia, type II diabetes or have metabolic syndrome. The disease is caused by too much fat accumulating in the liver (from 5% to 10% of liver weight). Most patients with fatty liver have no symptoms and do not cause any serious problems. However, in some cases, the liver can be damaged, causing symptoms of hepatomegaly.\n5. Liver abscess and common bile duct stones\nLiver abscess is an inflammation of the liver and the formation of pus, which can be caused by bacteria, amebiasis, liver flukes and fungi. Common bile duct stones cause long-term bile obstruction and also lead to liver enlargement. When experiencing this complication, the patient will have severe pain in the right lower quadrant, an enlarged liver and often fever.\n6. Right heart failure or constrictive pericarditis\nConstrictive pericarditis is a disease in which the pericardium, after inflammation, becomes thick and fibrous, gradually shrinking and squeezing the heart. This is a secondary consequence of chronic pericarditis due to many causes, leading to blood stasis of the inferior vena cava and liver, causing the liver to enlarge. The physical and functional symptoms of peripheral circulatory stasis include: edema, distended neck veins, enlarged liver, accompanied by pericardial percussion, best heard when inhaling. This heart sound is caused by sudden interruption of ventricular filling during diastole and pericardial fibrosis.\nAccording to experts, if not treated promptly and properly, constrictive pericarditis can progress to a serious stage with signs similar to right heart failure: peripheral edema, abdominal tenderness and ascites. . Right heart failure also leads to blood stasis of the inferior vena cava and liver, causing the liver to enlarge, and over time can lead to cirrhosis.\n7. Liver cancer\nCancer that originates in the liver is called primary liver cancer, cancer that metastasizes to the liver from other parts of the body is called secondary liver cancer. Each year, about 41,260 people in the United States receive a diagnosis of primary liver cancer. Liver cancer can cause swelling on the right side of the abdomen, because the liver is larger than normal because cancer cells are growing, causing swelling. Liver cancer that causes an enlarged liver usually has a large tumor and the liver cancer is no longer in an early stage. (first)\n8. Other causes of hepatomegaly\nLess common causes of hepatomegaly include:\n– Blood cancers, such as: leukemia, multiple myeloma and lymphoma. – Long-term causes of extrahepatic bile obstruction also cause hepatomegaly such as: pancreatic head tumors, biliary tract tumors, etc. – Genetic diseases such as Wilson disease (accumulation of copper in the liver), hemoglobinopathies, Gaucher disease and glycogen storage diseases. – Infections such as filariasis, schistosomiasis and trypanosomiasis. – Damage caused by toxins such as carbon tetrachloride and chloroform. – Certain types of abnormal growths such as cysts and tumors that start in the liver or spread to the liver can also lead to hepatomegaly.(4)",
