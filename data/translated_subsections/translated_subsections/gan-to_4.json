The danger of the disease depends on those causes. Severe cases can directly threaten life with venous congestion, cancer, etc.\nTherefore, when liver cells are damaged for a long time, the risk of destroying liver structures will increase, and over time the liver will become hardened, making it difficult to perform its functions well. When all liver functions are stagnant, other organs are also affected, including the lungs, kidneys, and brain.\nIf hepatomegaly is not promptly detected and treated, the patient will face many dangerous complications such as: widespread infection, hepatic encephalopathy, cirrhosis, liver failure, liver cancer...",
