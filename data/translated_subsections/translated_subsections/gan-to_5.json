    "subsection_content": "Liver enlargement can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). The treatment plan will be determined by the cause of the hepatomegaly.\nHepatitis: is an inflammation of the liver, which can be caused by a virus. Your doctor's specific treatment recommendations will depend on your medical history. If you are diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, your doctor may recommend antiviral treatment if the initial evaluation indicates an indication.\nHepatitis can be caused by a virus.\nMost people with hepatitis C will be considered for treatment, as the majority of this hepatitis will become chronic. Fortunately, oral antiviral medications last 3 - 6 months depending on whether cirrhosis is present or not. The virus clean result is > 90%.\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver: This condition occurs when liver cells accumulate fat in response to damage. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) refers to the accumulation of fat in the liver that is not caused by alcohol, viral infections, medications, or genetic diseases. A related term is nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which refers to inflammation-related steatosis. Just like people with other types of liver disease, people with NAFLD can progress to liver disease and cirrhosis. Obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia put you at higher risk for NAFLD. Treatment often focuses on lifestyle changes such as diet, exercise, weight loss, and medication if your illness gets worse.\nDrinking too much alcohol: Can cause a variety of liver diseases, including alcoholic hepatitis, alcoholic fatty liver disease or cirrhosis. It is important to recognize the signs and symptoms of alcohol use disorder early because patients often do not develop symptoms until liver disease is life-threatening.\nTreatment for alcohol use disorder can take many different forms, including: Alcohol withdrawal counseling, use of drugs to support alcohol withdrawal...\nLiver tumors: Both benign and malignant liver tumors can cause the liver to enlarge. The most common types of benign liver tumors include cysts, hemangiomas, adenomas, or focal nodular hyperplasia.\n– With common benign liver tumors, no treatment is needed for benign liver tumors, unless they cause severe symptoms such as abdominal pain or bleeding. – With malignant liver tumors, it can be divided into primary or secondary liver tumors. Primary liver tumors are tumors that arise directly from liver tissue. The most common examples are hepatocellular carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma.\nTreatment methods for primary liver tumors may include: surgery, radiofrequency or microwave ablation, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc.\nSecondary liver tumors are tumors from some other part of the body that is related to the liver. Tumors can grow directly into the liver (called direct invasion) or can spread to the liver through the bloodstream (called metastasis). Almost any tumor can metastasize to the liver and treatment is different.\nStorage disorders of the liver: This refers to a group of diseases in which the liver stores too much carbohydrate, minerals or other biological molecules. Usually, the cause is genetic and can be aggravated by your diet or other factors in your environment.\nThere are many liver storage diseases, such as hemoglobinopathies (the liver stores too much iron), Wilson's disease (too much copper), or glycogenosis (glycogen, a molecule related to sugar). If left untreated, these diseases can cause life-threatening liver failure. Treatment is variable and may include dietary changes or medications to capture the offending molecules.\nTreatment options depend on the underlying disorder causing hepatomegaly. Once your doctor confirms hepatomegaly, he or she will recommend lifestyle changes to ensure the health of your liver, including: limiting alcohol intake, eating a healthy diet, participating in exercise. Exercise regularly, lose weight if you are overweight.",
