    "subsection_content": "The early stages of varicocele often have no clinical manifestations. Most patients are diagnosed when the disease is late, with palpable dilated veins in the scrotum, or clinical symptoms of testicular pain.\nSome patients, when examined for male infertility, accidentally discover varicocele.\nDiagnosis of advanced varicocele is not difficult, using both clinical examination and ultrasound. According to the Dubin classification, varicocele is divided into 5 grades:\nGrade 0: Diagnosed only on ultrasound, angiography, or other diagnostic means but not detected clinically; Grade 1: palpable varicose veins when doing the Valsava test; Grade 2: palpable venous tufts when the patient is in an upright position; Grade 3: visible varicose veins when the patient is in an upright position; Grade 4: easy to see zigzag varicose veins under the scrotal skin whether standing or lying down.\nOn ultrasound, if the diameter of the spermatic vein is greater than 2.5mm, it is considered dilated. According to the Sarteschi classification, there are 5 levels of dilatation on Doppler ultrasound\nGrade 1: No varicocele in the scrotum. There is reflux of the spermatic plexus in the spermatic cord at the inguinal canal when doing the Valsava test.; Grade 2: No varicocele in lying position. In the standing position, there is relaxation and reflux localized at the upper pole of the testicles, when doing the Valsava test.; Grade 3: No varicocele in lying position. Standing position has relaxation and reflux flow spreads to both the upper and lower poles of the testicles, when doing the Valsava test.; Grade 4: The spermatic veins are dilated and there is reflux when doing the Valsava test in the lying position.; Grade 5: The spermatic cord is dilated, there is reflux even without doing the Valsava test",
