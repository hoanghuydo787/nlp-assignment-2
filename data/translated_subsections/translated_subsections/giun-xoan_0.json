Currently, the world has recorded 8 species of trichinosis  including: T. spiralis, T. nativa, T. britovi, T. murrelli, T. nelsoni, T. pseudospiralis, T. papure and T. zimbabwensis and 4 genotypes of trichinosis ( genotypes T6, T8, T9, T12).\nTwisted worms not only cause disease in adulthood but also in the larval stage. People get Trichinellosis by eating raw, undercooked meat, mainly pork that contains parasites. Worms cause acute illness and can cause epidemics. People infected with trichinosis will have abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, and body fever; Can even lead to myocarditis and encephalitis. (first)",
