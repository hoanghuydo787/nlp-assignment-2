    "subsection_content": "Adult pinworms live in the small intestine of humans or some mammals (pigs, dogs, cats, mice, bears...). In some severe cases, roundworms parasitize even the large intestine. (2)\nMale worms are expelled from the body after intercourse with female worms. Meanwhile, female worms continue to burrow deep into the intestinal mucosa and parasitize there. Unlike some other types of parasites, female pinworms do not lay eggs but lay larvae in the intestinal mucosa, sometimes directly into lymph vessels and mesenteric lymph nodes. After 5 days of parasitism, the female worm lays about 1,500 larvae, each larva is about 0.1 mm long. Ultimately, the female dies.\nAfter the next 10-15 days, the larvae are capable of causing disease. The larvae enter the blood through the arterial circulatory system and circulate throughout the body, concentrating mainly in the skeletal muscle system. Skeletal muscle plays an important role in developing and maintaining muscle function. Muscles that larvae can attack include the diaphragm, jaw, tongue, larynx and eyes...\nWhen parasitic in the muscles, the larvae are encased in white cocoons with a size of 250 - 400?m. The larvae in the cocoon curl up like a spring. A cocoon contains at least one larva. Normally, a single larva occupies each muscle fiber. Larvae can live in cocoons for 6 - 24 months.\nAfter 6 - 9 months, the cocoon will gradually calcify. In some cases, the calcification process is delayed, the helminth larvae can survive for several years, even up to 30 - 40 years later.\nHumans and mammals (pigs, dogs, cats, bears, rats, seals, sheep...) eat infected animal meat, and after only 24 hours entering the small intestine,  trichinosis larvae develop into adult worms and capture them. first penetrates the mucosa of the small intestine. Within 24 - 30 hours, the larvae undergo 4 molts in the stomach, become sexually complete and begin a new life cycle.",
