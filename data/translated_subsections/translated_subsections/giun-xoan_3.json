According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 1940 there were about 400 cases of the disease but from 2008 to 2010 there were only about 20 cases/year.\nPeople with the disease are mainly hunters and people who eat wild animals. Particularly in Asia, the number of cases recorded is high in China, where pork consumption is the highest in the world. In Vietnam, at least 6 clusters of trichinosis have been discovered, with over 126 people infected and 8 deaths. (3)\nHumans eat undercooked pork contaminated with cocoons containing trichinic larvae. After eating, under the influence of the human body's digestive enzymes, the larvae are released from the cocoon in the stomach and move to the small intestine. Adult worms do not cause serious intestinal disease.\nMost diseases are benign and can be cured after 6 months, but there are some cases that lead to complications such as: myocarditis, arrhythmia, pneumonia, nephritis, chronic diarrhea; even death.",
