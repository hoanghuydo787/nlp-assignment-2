    "subsection_content": "The most common cause of hypoglycemia is a side effect of diabetes medications. Using too much insulin or accidentally injecting the wrong type of insulin can also lead to hypoglycemia. (2)\n1. Regulate blood sugar levels\nWhen food enters the body, it will be broken down into glucose (the main source of energy for the body). Glucose enters the cells with the help of insulin (hormone produced by the pancreas). Excess glucose is stored in the liver as glycogen. When you don't eat for a few hours, your blood sugar level drops and your body stops producing insulin. At this time, the hormone glucagon (produced by the pancreas) signals the liver to break down glycogen, releasing glucose into the blood. This procedure helps stabilize blood sugar levels. During prolonged fasting, the body breaks down fat stores and uses fat breakdown products as alternative fuel. The process of breaking down (burning) fat creates acid in an anaerobic environment. When fat sources are depleted (the body burns all stored fat), a lot of acid is produced. At this time, the patient is susceptible to both low blood sugar and acidosis.\nHypoglycemia is a condition in which the amount of sugar (glucose) in the blood falls below the standard level.\n2. Have diabetes\nFor people with diabetes, when the body does not produce insulin (type 1 diabetes) or produces little insulin or does not use insulin effectively (type 2 diabetes). As a result, glucose accumulates in the blood, reaching dangerously high levels. At this time, the patient uses insulin or other medications to reduce blood sugar levels. But taking large amounts of insulin or other diabetes medications can cause blood sugar levels to drop too much, causing hypoglycemia.\nInsulin overdose leads to hypoglycemia.\n3. Other causes when not having diabetes\nHypoglycemia in people without diabetes is less common. Causes may include:\nImproper use of medication: accidentally taking diabetes medication can cause hypoglycemia. In addition, other drugs cause hypoglycemia: quinine (qualaquin – used to treat malaria).; Drinking a lot of alcohol: prevents the liver from releasing glycogen to form glucose into the blood, leading to hypoglycemia.; Chronic diseases: severe hepatitis, cirrhosis, severe infections, kidney disease, worsening heart disease can cause hypoglycemia. Kidney disorders also cause the body to not excrete properly, leading to glucose accumulation, causing hypoglycemia.; Fasting for too long: malnutrition, not enough food, lack of stored glycogen that the body needs to create glucose... leading to hypoglycemia.; Overproduction of insulin: A rare tumor in the pancreas (insulinoma) causes the patient to produce too much insulin, leading to hypoglycemia. In addition, other tumors and abnormal cells of the pancreas also release excessive insulin, causing hypoglycemia.; Hormone deficiency: adrenal gland disorders and pituitary tumors can easily lead to deficiencies in certain hormones that regulate glucose production or metabolism. Additionally, children can develop hypoglycemia if they have too little growth hormone (GH).; Too far after a meal: the body does not have enough glucose, easily causing hypoglycemia.\n4. Hypoglycemia after meals\nSometimes hypoglycemia symptoms occur after certain meals, called reactive hypoglycemia or postprandial hypoglycemia. This condition often occurs in people who have had gastric bypass surgery.",
