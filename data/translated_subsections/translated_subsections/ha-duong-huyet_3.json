    "subsection_content": "Low blood sugar levels trigger the release of epinephrine (adrenaline) causing symptoms: pounding heart, sweating, tingling, anxiety, pale skin, nausea, numbness of tongue/lips/cheeks. If blood glucose levels continue to decrease, the brain does not receive enough glucose, so brain activities are affected, leading to: blurred vision, difficulty concentrating, confused thinking, slurred speech, and drowsiness. When blood sugar drops for a long time, the brain has no glucose, causing seizures, coma... even death.\nUsually symptoms of hypoglycemia appear when blood sugar levels are lower than 70mg/dL. However, many people have blood sugar levels below this level but do not see symptoms, called hypoglycemia unawareness. Therefore, patients do not know when hypoglycemia occurs so they do not treat it, leading to a high risk of more serious symptoms. This condition is common in people with long-term diabetes.\nWhen should you go to a medical facility?\nTypically, a fasting blood sugar of 70 mg/dL or 3.9mmol/L or lower will warn of hypoglycemia.
