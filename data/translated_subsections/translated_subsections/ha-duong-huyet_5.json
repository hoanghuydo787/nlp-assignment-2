    "subsection_content": "When hypoglycemia occurs, the patient needs to be treated immediately using the 15-15 rule. Specifically: eat/drink 15 grams of carbohydrates (carbs) to increase blood sugar and check after 15 minutes. If blood sugar is still below 70 mg/dL, continue taking another serving. Repeat these steps until your blood sugar level is at least 70 mg/dL. When your blood sugar returns to normal, eat a meal or snack. (3)\nFood equivalent to 15g Glucose:\n2 or 3 sugar cubes.; 1/2 cup of any fruit juice.; 1/2 cup soft drink.; 1 glass of milk.; 5 or 6 candies.; 15ml or 1 tablespoon sugar or honey.\nAs soon as there are signs of hypoglycemia, the patient should eat 5-6 candies or 1 tablespoon of honey.\nNote: The goal of hypoglycemia treatment is early detection and safe and quickest hyperglycemia to reduce complications and improve symptoms. Overtreatment should be avoided because it can increase blood sugar and cause weight gain.\nThe choice of carbohydrate source is very important. Complex carbohydrates (beans, peanuts, potatoes, corn, parsnips, cereals, whole grains, etc.) or foods that contain fat along with carbs (like chocolate) can slow down Glucose absorption process should not be used to treat hypoglycemia. Regarding long-term treatment, it is necessary to identify and treat the cause of hypoglycemia.\nMany people tend to want to eat more carbs until they feel better. This can cause blood sugar levels to increase. Using the step-by-step approach of the 15-15 rule prevents high blood sugar levels. (4)\nChildren usually need less than 15 grams of carbs to improve hypoglycemia.\nNewborns need 6 grams.\nToddlers need 8 grams.\nYoung children need 10 grams.\nWhen severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients need glucagon injections. This is a hormone produced in the pancreas that stimulates the liver to release stored glucose into the blood. Glucagon is used to treat a person with diabetes when the person's blood sugar is too low to treat according to the 15-15 rule. Do not inject insulin because it will cause more serious hypoglycemia.",
