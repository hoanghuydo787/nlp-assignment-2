When this happens, the risk of severe, life-threatening hypoglycemia increases. Therefore, people with diabetes need to measure blood sugar daily.\n2. For untreated diabetes\nIf you have diabetes, episodes of low blood sugar will cause discomfort and make the patient fearful. Patients tend to arbitrarily take less insulin to ensure blood sugar does not drop too low. This leads to uncontrolled blood sugar and drug resistance. Therefore, when having any symptoms (fatigue, dizziness, lightheadedness...) or measuring low blood sugar results, the patient should see a doctor or strictly follow the treating doctor's instructions.\nCheck blood sugar regularly to adjust medication and diet appropriately and prevent hyper/hypoglycemia.",
