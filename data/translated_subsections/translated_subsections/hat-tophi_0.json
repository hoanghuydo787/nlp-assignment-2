They look like small, swollen bumps and develop just below the skin at the joints.\nThe appearance of tophi spots under the skin can be considered a sign that gout has become more severe, usually occurring in about 12 - 35% of cases. If gout is not treated promptly and effectively, it is difficult for patients to avoid joint damage.(1)",
