The kidneys play a role in regulating uric acid levels by filtering this compound out of the blood. If the kidneys cannot filter it all or the body produces too much of the above active ingredients, hyperuricemia will occur.\nAt that time, a certain amount of uric acid will leave the blood and begin to deposit into sharp crystals in the joints and surrounding soft tissues, causing inflammation there. The increasing number of crystals will form tophi.\nThus, it can be seen that tophi do not appear from the beginning, but instead, these nodules will develop in the late stages of (chronic) gout. Usually, the disease takes about 10 years (or less) from the time of onset to progress to this stage.",
