However, they will still ask patients to have a CT or MRI scan to evaluate large particles and the extent of damage to bones and joint cartilage.\nIn addition, sometimes the components inside the tophi are also removed and analyzed under a microscope to provide the most accurate and detailed diagnosis of chronic gout, thereby helping doctors develop a treatment plan. Effective treatment, suitable for patients.",
