    "subsection_content": "Treating tophi is often part of a gout treatment regimen. Depending on the size of the nodule, each patient will have their own treatment, such as:\nFor small sized particles\nSmall nodules usually do not cause pain or limit excessive movement, so surgical removal of the nodules is not necessary. Instead, patients can dissolve the particles and shrink their size by:\nUse medication\nThe goal of this method is to reduce the amount of uric acid in the blood to 5 mg/dL or lower to dissolve tophi particles. Commonly prescribed gout medications are:\nGroup of drugs that inhibit uric acid synthesis (allopurinol, febuxostat...) Pegloticase with the effect of catalyzing the conversion of uric acid into allantoin, which is easily soluble and easily eliminated (3); Group of drugs that inhibit uric acid synthesis (allopurinol, febuxostat...); Pegloticase catalyzes the conversion of uric acid into soluble and easily eliminated allantoin (3)\nIn addition, your doctor may also prescribe a number of other medications to control acute attacks of chronic gout, including:\nColchicine Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain relievers NSAIDs (indomethacine, ibuprofen...) Interleukin-1 inhibitors Corticosteroids; Colchicine; Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain relievers NSAIDs (indomethacine, ibuprofen...); Interleukin-1 inhibitors; Corticosteroids; Change daily living habits\nA healthy, scientific lifestyle not only helps control gout symptoms, including tophi, minimizing the risk of flare-ups, but also contributes to improving overall health.
