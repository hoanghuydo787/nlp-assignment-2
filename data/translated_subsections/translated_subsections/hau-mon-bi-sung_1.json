    "subsection_content": "A swollen anus can be caused by many different reasons. However, the most common causes come from other anal diseases. Anal swelling is one of the clinical signs that helps patients recognize the state of their digestive health, specifically their anus.(2)\nSome typical diseases with signs of anal swelling include: anal fissures, hemorrhoids, anal abscesses, anal infections,...\n1. Infected anal fissure\nAn anal fissure is a condition in which scratches, tears or ulcers appear at the edge of the anal canal. This is a benign disease but the second most common disease related to the anus, after hemorrhoids. Anal fissures cause burning pain in the anal area, sometimes bleeding due to ulcers in the damaged mucosal area. The disease is common in middle-aged people. In addition, the disease can also be caused by the patient trying to push hard stools, thereby damaging the mucosa at the edge of the anal canal.\nOne of the symptoms of anal fissures is a swollen anus. This symptom appears mainly after the patient defecates. The anus is swollen due to the friction of stool, especially hard stool, with existing tears in the mucosa. Therefore, sometimes patients will also see blood mixed in the stool after defecation.(1)\nIn addition, anal fissures also have other symptoms such as anal itching, cracks or excess skin in the skin around the anus.\nSome causes of anal fissures include:\nHard stools, difficult to eliminate; Diarrhea; Irritable bowel syndrome; The anal sphincter is too tight; There is a tumor in the anal mucosa; Infection\n2. Anal abscess\nAn anal abscess is an infection of the anus with pus. The tissues and nerves in the anus are very sensitive and easily irritated. When the anal glands are blocked, it will lead to anal infection. An anal abscess eventually forms when the infection becomes severe and there is pus around it.\nPeople with anal abscess will clearly feel pain and swelling in the anal area. This is a symptom of a swollen anus caused by an anal abscess. Other clinical signs of an anal abscess include a lump around the anus and fever.\nIf the patient has all of the above symptoms, this is a sign that the infection is quite serious and needs to see a doctor for timely examination and treatment.\nBecause anal abscesses are caused by an infection, people with colitis are considered to be at high risk for anal abscesses and anal swelling.\nA study in the US showed that anal abscesses occur more often in women than men.\n3. Abscessed anal fistula\nAnal fistula is also a form of anal infection but there is a tunnel connecting the infected gland with other skin areas around the anus and anal opening. Anal fistula, also known as eel vascular disease, is often a complication of anal abscess. That means, people with anal abscesses have a high risk of anal fistula if the disease is not treated promptly.\nAnal fistula is not a dangerous disease or seriously affects the patient's life. However, the symptoms of the disease will significantly reduce the patient's quality of life. Symptoms of anal fistula include:\nSwollen anus; Anal stimulation; Pain and itching in the anal area; Leakage of feces through the anus (3)\n4. Swollen anus due to hemorrhoids\nHemorrhoids are a condition in which the veins inside the anus become swollen, causing pain and discomfort for the patient. Hemorrhoids are the most common disease among anal diseases. It is estimated that 1 in 20 Americans will have hemorrhoids, and the disease can happen to people of any age.\nThere are two types of hemorrhoids: internal hemorrhoids and external hemorrhoids. External hemorrhoids are hemorrhoids located below the dentate line and covered by squamous epithelium. Internal hemorrhoids are hemorrhoids located above the dentate line and lined with rectal mucosa. The disease is a consequence of increased pressure in the veins of the anus or rectum. This often happens in people who often carry heavy loads or during pregnancy, but most commonly in people who have a habit of pushing hard when defecating.\nIf hemorrhoids are thrombosed, they will cause pain, the anus will become purple and swollen, and it will be difficult for the patient to clean the anus. Furthermore, hemorrhoids are also the cause of bloody stools and mucus secretion.\n5. Due to inflammation of the anal canal, perianal dermatitis\nAnal inflammation is a phenomenon in which the lining of the anal canal is damaged. This inflammation occurs after the patient consumes too much hot and spicy food, leading to the secretion of a lot of acid in the stomach. Foods such as acid, coffee or food particles left in the excreted stool will collide with the mucosa in the anal canal or anal opening. This causes inflammation of the lining inside the anus.\nAnal inflammation is not a dangerous disease, it causes symptoms of a swollen anus, sometimes with fluid or blood during defecation. However, patients can completely be treated medically with medication.\n6. Crohn's disease\nCrohn's disease is a chronic transmural inflammatory bowel disease. The disease often originates from inflammation of the cavity or abscess, from there progressing to ulcers on the mucosal wall of the anus. There are three types of Crohn's disease: anal inflammation, anal stricture or obstruction, and anal fistula.\nAdditionally, Crohn's disease also affects the ileum and colon. The patient will experience symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, swollen anus, tender abdomen, and may see lumps or masses inside the abdomen. Patients need to treat the disease early to avoid dangerous complications of the disease such as increased risk of small bowel cancer, colorectal cancer or ulcerative colitis.\n7. Anal sex\nAnal sex is an activity that can cause anal swelling. The impact of lovemaking will damage the skin in the anal opening and anal canal. Especially when having sex too vigorously, or using sexual aids, collision with the anal skin will easily cause injuries such as bleeding, scratches, infection or anal rupture. swelling.\n8. Anal cancer\nAnal cancer is a condition in which cancer cells begin to appear in the anus. Based on the location where the cells appear, anal cancer is divided into two groups: anal canal cancer and perianal skin cancer.\nAnal squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of anal cancer. The causes of anal cancer are usually:\nSTDs caused by HPV virus infection; Advanced age; Prolonged anal fistula; The anus often experiences irritation\nAnal cancer causes symptoms such as:\nSwollen or lumpy anus; Bleeding from the anus; Anal canal pain; Bleeding or discharge",
