    "subsection_content": "The doctor will review the patient's clinical symptoms and perform an examination of the patient's anal canal to find previous warts. After having enough clinical information, the doctor will prescribe the appropriate endoscopic method.\n1. Anal examination\nAnoscopy is a method of diagnosing cases where patients have symptoms of a swollen anus but do not have warts or problems in the skin around the anus.\nThe doctor will use an endoscopy tool equipped with a specialized camera to enter the patient's anus and examine the condition of the mucosa, tissues, and nerves inside the anus. Based on the image results, the doctor will make a conclusion about the cause of the patient's anal swelling.\n2. Sigmoidoscopy\nSigmoidoscopy, also known as colonoscopy without biopsy, is a method of directly examining the sigmoid colon. The doctor will insert a flexible scope into the patient's body through the anus. From there, examine the rectum and anus.\nThe method is indicated for cases where the anus is swollen with severe abdominal pain, heavy blood in the stool, and foreign objects in the colon.\nHowever, sigmoidoscopy is not applied to the following subjects:\nPregnant women over 3 months; People with myocardial infarction or cardiovascular diseases; People with colon perforation or peritonitis or unstable colon health\n3. Colonoscopy\nIn colonoscopy, the flexible endoscope used will be longer so it can be inserted deeper into the patient's rectum and colon.\nThis method will be indicated for subjects with symptoms of swollen anus who go to work with suspected signs of abnormal tumors or cancer cells inside the anus.\n4. Ultrasound of the anal cavity: Diagnosis of anal abscess\nAnorectal magnetic resonance imaging with contrast injection: helps diagnose anal abscesses and fistulas that cause swelling around the anus.",
