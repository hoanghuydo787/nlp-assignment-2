Take medical history and history\nYour doctor will ask about your asthma signs and symptoms to find out whether asthma or something else is causing your problem. Typical questions are:\nWhat are your symptoms? When do you experience these symptoms?; What triggers your symptoms, for example cold air, exercise, allergies...?; Do you have a history of allergies or allergic diseases (eczema, allergic rhinitis...)? Do any family members have asthma?; Are you regularly exposed to cigarette smoke, pets, dust, and chemicals in the air?; Do symptoms decrease after using bronchodilators or corticosteroids?\n2. Clinical examination of asthma\nBased on the signs and symptoms when asking the patient, the doctor determines the diagnosis and conducts a clinical examination. This provides additional information for definitive diagnosis and differential diagnosis with some other lung diseases such as COPD and bronchiectasis.\nWhere is a good place to get tested for asthma?

Measure respiratory function\nSpirometry is a way to check how well your lungs are working.\nDoctors use spirometry to diagnose asthma and monitor its progression. Normally, patients will have a bronchial recovery test. If lung function improves after using bronchodilators, the patient has a high chance of having asthma.\nPeak flow measurement: measures how well your lungs push air out. Although not as accurate as spirometry, these lung function tests can be a good way to regularly check your lung function at home. A peak flow meter can help you detect what's causing your asthma to get worse, whether treatment is working, and when you need to go to the emergency room.\n4. Imaging diagnosis\nA chest X-ray or CT scan can show if there are any other problems with your lungs, or whether asthma is causing your symptoms. X-ray or computed tomography plays an important role in differentiating asthma from other respiratory diseases such as endobronchial tuberculosis, bronchiectasis...; A chest X-ray or CT scan can show if there are any other problems with your lungs, or whether asthma is causing your symptoms. X-ray or computed tomography plays an important role in differentiating asthma from other respiratory diseases such as endobronchial tuberculosis, bronchiectasis...\nCT scan: Nasal polyps or sinusitis can make asthma more difficult to treat and control. Sinusitis, also known as sinus infection, is a condition in which the sinuses become inflamed or swollen due to infection. When the sinuses become clogged and filled with fluid, bacteria grow, causing infection and inflammation. Your doctor may order a special sinus X-ray, called a CT scan, to check your sinuses if they think you have an infection. If you have sinusitis, you will be treated with antibiotics for at least 10 – 12 days.

Stimulants include exercise, inhaled methacholine, histamine, voluntary hyperventilation with normocapnia, or inhaled mannitol. Currently very little is done because of the high risk of complications.\nAllergy tests: skin prick tests or quantification of serum immunoglobulin E (lgE) levels specific to respiratory allergens help detect hypersensitivity to these allergens.\nMeasuring exhaled Nitric Oxide concentration (FENO): FeNO meets the need to individualize asthma treatment, helping to detect groups of patients with inflammatory mechanisms capable of responding to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS: inhaled corticosteroid) or other specific anti-inflammatory drugs; Avoid using ICS in patients unlikely to respond.",
