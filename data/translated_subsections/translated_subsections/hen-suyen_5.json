    "subsection_content": "There are different types of asthma, the most common type is bronchial asthma, which affects the bronchi in the lungs. Other forms of asthma: childhood asthma and adult-onset asthma. In particular, asthma begins in adults, symptoms do not appear until at least 20 years old. (8)\n1. Allergic asthma (extrinsic asthma)\nAllergens trigger this common type of asthma. These can include pet dander, food, pollen, dust, etc. Allergic asthma is often seasonal because the disease often goes hand in hand with seasonal allergies.\n2. Non-allergic asthma (intrinsic asthma)\nIrritants in the air unrelated to allergies trigger this type of asthma. Irritants include: wood burning, cigarette smoke, cold air, air pollution, viral diseases, air fresheners, household cleaning products, perfumes, etc.\n3. Occupational asthma\nOccupational asthma is a disease caused by agents in the workplace such as dust, dyes, gases and fumes, industrial chemicals, latex... These irritants can exist in many industries. Industry includes agriculture, wood processing, manufacturing...\n4. Exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB)\nExercise-induced bronchospasm usually affects people within a few minutes of starting exercise and up to 10 – 15 minutes after physical activity. This condition is called exercise-induced asthma (EIA). Nearly 90% of people with asthma also experience EIB, but not everyone with EIB will have other types of asthma.\n5. Aspirin-induced asthma\nAspirin-induced asthma (AIA), also known as aspirin-induced acute respiratory disease (AERD), is often severe. It is triggered by taking aspirin or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, naproxen or ibuprofen… Symptoms begin within minutes or hours. These patients often have nasal polyps. About 9% of people with asthma have AIA, which usually develops suddenly in adults between the ages of 20 and 50.\n6. Nocturnal asthma\nIn other types of asthma, symptoms are worse at night. Triggers that cause symptoms at night include heartburn, pet dander, dust mites, etc. The body's natural sleep cycle can also cause nocturnal asthma.\n7. Cough-like bronchial asthma (CVA)\nCough-type asthma does not have the usual asthma symptoms of wheezing and shortness of breath. The disease is characterized by a persistent dry cough. If left untreated, CVA can lead to an asthma flare-up with a number of other common symptoms.\n8. Adult-onset asthma\nAsthma can occur at any age, it is more common in people under 40 years old. Asthma attacks do not go away when the patient uses bronchodilators. It is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment.\n9. Asthma in children\nEach episode will have different symptoms. Children often have problems such as frequent coughing, especially when playing at night or when laughing.; Children often have less energy or pause to catch their breath while playing.; Rapid or shallow breathing; The chest shows pain or feels tense.; Hear a hissing sound when breathing in or out.; Chest movements due to difficulty breathing, tight neck and chest muscles, weakness or fatigue...",
