If not treated promptly, the patient will suffer serious, life-threatening complications such as:\nEmphysema, chronic cor pulmonale: common in people with chronic, severe asthma; Chest deformity or chronic respiratory failure; Collapsed lung: often occurs in children (accounting for 30%);; Pneumothorax: appears in 5% of asthma patients so it is easy to misdiagnose. Bilateral pneumothorax puts patients at high risk of death.; Complications of treatment: prolonged use of corticosteroids can cause pseudo-cushing's syndrome.\nAsthma is a non-communicable disease, however it has genetic factors from relatives. Let's find out if asthma is dangerous and the harmful effects it causes.",
