    "subsection_content": "The foreskin, with an outer surface of skin and an inner surface of mucosa, surrounds and protects the glans (head of the penis). The foreskin protects the glans and keeps it soft, warm, moist, and sensitive.\nThe glans mucosa has glands that secrete mucus, which when accumulated will create a white layer of genital sebum between the glans and the foreskin. The foreskin is sensitive to sexual stimulation and is necessary for normal sexual activity.\nThe penis and glans are naturally clean. However, the penis is also a place where outside bacteria can enter the body, especially during intercourse.",
