    "subsection_content": "In children under 6 years old, phimosis is often physiological and only needs treatment when it causes urinary tract obstruction or infection, etc. About 90% of children after 3 years old can easily lose their foreskin. Do not try to remove the foreskin early to avoid pain, bleeding or possibly sticking the glans to the foreskin and scarring the foreskin, causing secondary foreskin narrowing.\nIn older children or adults, phimosis needs to be distinguished from a short frenulum (although the two conditions often go together). Foreskin stenosis in older children and adults, if there is no serious problem, non-surgical methods can be used.",
