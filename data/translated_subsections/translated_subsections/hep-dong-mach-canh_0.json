    "subsection_content": "Carotid stenosis is a condition in which the vessel wall thickens due to atherosclerotic plaques, gradually narrowing the vessel lumen. The carotid arteries on both sides are main branches originating from the thoracic aorta, passing in the carotid trough along both sides of the neck to supply blood to the brain. Blood flow to the brain is therefore also reduced.\nWhen the stenosis is severe, it can cause brain damage due to anemia. The degree of brain damage, more or less, will manifest clinically with signs of transient ischemic attack or stroke. (first)",
