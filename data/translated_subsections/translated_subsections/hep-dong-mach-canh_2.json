It lasts a few minutes, then goes away completely.\nThere are patients with only one symptom, on the other hand, there are patients with many symptoms at the same time. The standard for diagnosing transient ischemic attack recommended by the American Heart Association is the absence of cerebral infarct lesions on brain CT or MRI scans.

Stroke is confirmed when there is an image of cerebral infarction on CT or MRI of the brain.\nThe risk of stroke will be reduced by more than 50%, if people with carotid artery stenosis over 70% have carotid endarterectomy. However, cases of extracranial carotid artery stenosis often do not have any symptoms until accidentally discovered or when complications occur. Therefore, regular examinations for people with high risk factors for carotid artery stenosis are extremely necessary, so that the disease can be promptly detected and treated.",
