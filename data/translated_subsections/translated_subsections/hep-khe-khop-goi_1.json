Specifically, the Kellgren – Lawrence scale is used as follows:\n0: The joint space shows no signs of abnormality.; 1: An abnormal change appears in the joint space.; 2: The joint space changes insignificantly, bone spurs appear.; 3: Joint space changes moderately with many bone spurs, accompanied by joint space narrowing; 4: The joint space changes seriously with significant narrowing, large bone spurs appear, and the bone ends are clearly deformed.",
