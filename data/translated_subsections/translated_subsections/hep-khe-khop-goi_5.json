    "subsection_content": "For narrow knee joints, the doctor will initially conduct a physical examination, learn about medical history, injuries, location, level of pain, etc. After that, the joint palpation will also be performed. may be done to test flexibility and discomfort with movement. Next, the doctor will prescribe a number of imaging diagnostic methods to reach the most accurate conclusions, including:\n1. Take X-rays\nThis is often the first method prescribed for knee joint stenosis. X-rays of the knee joint will help doctors identify many important issues such as:\nThe degree of knee joint narrowing, the possibility of progression of arthritis.; Abnormal signs of the knee joint, joint misalignment, ability to connect bones.; Appearance of bone spurs.; Signs of injury and fracture (if any): tibial plateau fracture, patella fracture...; Signs of soft tissue swelling; Existence of excess fluid in the knee.; Detailed lesions related to bones (bone disorders, osteoporosis), bone density.\nX-ray results are usually available within just a few minutes of the procedure. This is one of the reasons why this method is commonly used in diagnosing knee stenosis.\n2. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive, painless test that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to collect two- or three-dimensional images of the structures inside the knee. Through this method, doctors can observe details of tissues, joints and bones, thereby helping to make more accurate conclusions about knee joint space narrowing. In particular, this is a test that is often ordered when it is suspected that damage comes from a cause other than arthritis.\n3. Ultrasound\nWith this method, the doctor will apply a layer of gel to the knee joint area to be examined, then use a probe to transmit sound waves into the body. From there, images of the internal structures will be simulated in detail, helping to support a more accurate diagnosis of joint space narrowing. Ultrasound is usually performed quickly and painlessly. However, when the probe moves, it may cause discomfort to the damaged joint area.",
