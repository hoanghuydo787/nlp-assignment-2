    "subsection_content": "Depending on the condition of knee joint stenosis, the doctor will prescribe appropriate treatment methods, including: (4)\n1. Non-drug treatment\nFor most cases of knee stenosis, the doctor will advise the patient to lose weight if necessary. This helps reduce pressure on the joints, which can lead to significant improvement.\nIn addition, physical therapy is also the preferred treatment option. Among them, hydrotherapy (performed in water environment) is being widely applied because it shows positive effects. This is the optimal method for cases of severe arthritis who are unable to function in a normal environment due to pain.\nAccordingly, the water environment can reduce or eliminate gravity combined with warmth to help relax muscles, creating a more comfortable feeling during treatment. In addition, hydrostatic pressure acting on the body also has the effect of reducing edema and swelling. Therefore, the knee joint will function more effectively without having to be affected by weight and gravity.\n2. Medical treatment\nPain relievers: Commonly used drugs in this treatment regimen include Codeine, Acetaminophen, Aspirin, Codeine, Oxycodone, Hydrocodone... The main mechanism of action is to focus on changing the brain's perception of pain. , does not attack the pain cycle directly.; Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Compared to conventional pain relievers, NSAIDs work by a completely new mechanism, specifically focusing on blocking the effects of the Cyclooxygenase enzyme.\n3. Treatment according to pathogenesis\nSteroid injection: This method is a local approach to treating symptoms of knee joint space narrowing. Among them, Coritsone is often preferred because of its strong anti-inflammatory ability. Specifically, the doctor will inject directly into the knee joint to increase absorption efficiency, help reduce pain and improve mobility.; Knee lubricant injection: A gel-like substance is injected into the knee joint to lubricate and relieve pain. The main ingredient in these injectables is usually Hyaluronic Acid. This is a substance found in joint fluid, but when inflammation occurs, the content is reduced, affecting viscosity and consistency. Depending on each case, the doctor will prescribe the patient a single injection or once a week, continuously for many weeks.\n4. Surgical treatment\nSurgery will be indicated when medical treatments do not bring about effective improvement. This is the optimal choice to prevent serious long-term complications, especially when knee stenosis comes from arthritis. Some surgical methods that may be indicated include:\nKnee arthroscopy: This is a minimally invasive procedure, the doctor can observe detailed damage inside the knee joint to perform treatment.; Knee replacement: Joint replacement is indicated in cases where knee stenosis has progressed to a serious level that cannot be treated with endoscopy. Accordingly, this method will help regenerate the surface of the femur and shin bones by implanting artificial materials. Since then, pain symptoms and mobility have improved significantly.",
