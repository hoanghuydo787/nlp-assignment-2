    "subsection_content": "The process of plaque accumulation takes place over many years, even decades. As your arteries narrow, you may notice chest pain and heaviness. This is a manifestation of an imbalance between supply and demand: the heart muscle must work harder to serve the entire body, but the coronary arteries are too narrow, not enough blood to refeed the heart muscle. When the heart muscle has to work too hard but does not receive adequate blood supply, heart muscle cells will die, burst, release a lot of acid, stimulate nerve endings, causing chest pain.\nSymptoms of chronic coronary artery stenosis include: (3)\nStable angina: This is the most common manifestation. The pain often appears when you are physically active or mentally stressed, and goes away if you rest or take nitroglycerin (a medicine to treat angina).; Difficulty breathing: This symptom often occurs when you do light-intensity physical activity.\nSometimes, the first symptoms of coronary artery stenosis are those of a heart attack, including:\nAngina ranges from mild to severe. You will feel heaviness, tightness, burning pain, and numbness in the left chest area. This discomfort can spread to the shoulders, arms, neck, back or jaw;; Shortness of breath;; Dizziness, lightheadedness;; Heart beating fast;; Nausea, stomach discomfort;; Exhausted.",
