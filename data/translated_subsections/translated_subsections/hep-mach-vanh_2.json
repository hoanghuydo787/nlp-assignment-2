To make it easier to visualize: coronary arteries narrow 1%/year. From birth, it gradually narrows, and by the age of 50, the coronary arteries are only slightly narrowed, and blood is still enough to feed the heart muscle. By the age of 60, the coronary arteries are 60% narrowed and the remaining 40%. The amount of blood coming in is not enough to feed the heart muscle. Some heart muscle dies and ruptures, releasing acid that stimulates nerves, causing chest pain.\nPlaque consists of cholesterol, waste products, calcium and fibrin (a substance that helps blood clot). As plaque continues to build up along the artery wall, the artery becomes narrow and stiff.\nRisk factors for coronary artery disease\nThere are 2 groups of risk factors for coronary artery disease:\nRisk factors cannot be controlled\nAge: The older you are, the more likely you are to develop coronary artery stenosis. Men over 45 years old face a higher risk of getting the disease, while this risk is high in women over 55 years old.; Family history: If members of your biological family had early heart disease, your chances of having coronary artery stenosis are quite high. “Early heart disease” means diagnosed at a young age (father or brother before age 55, mother or sister before age 65).\nFactors that increase the risk of coronary artery stenosis\nA diet high in saturated fat or refined carbohydrates; Lack of physical activity; Constant insomnia; Smoke; Other cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension, arrhythmia; Atherosclerosis; Autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis; Chronic kidney disease; Diabetes; Metabolic syndrome; Overweight – obesity; Sleep disorders, sleep apnea; Early menopause (before age 40); Endometrial optimism; Use hormonal contraception\nOverweight - obesity and lack of exercise are factors that increase the risk of coronary artery stenosis",
