    "subsection_content": "Serious complications of coronary artery disease can occur after many years without treatment. At that time, the coronary arteries narrow so severely that they become completely blocked, blocking blood flow to the heart. This leads to insufficient oxygen and nutrients being supplied to the heart muscle, causing:\nMyocardial infarction: This is a phenomenon of lack of blood flow to the heart muscle, characterized by chest pain and difficulty breathing. Less common symptoms include nausea and vomiting, indigestion, difficulty breathing, night sweats, numbness or tingling in the left side of the chest, left arm, shoulder, upper abdomen, neck, jaw.; Heart arrhythmia: Irregular heartbeat often occurs after a myocardial infarction, causing the patient to feel tired, dizzy, have palpitations or faint.; Heart failure: Part of the heart muscle becomes weak after a heart attack, leading to heart failure. Patients have symptoms of fatigue, difficulty breathing, and leg swelling.",
