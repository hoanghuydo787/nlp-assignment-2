    "subsection_content": "Treatment for coronary artery stenosis usually includes lifestyle changes, controlling risk factors, and medication. If the stenosis is severe, the doctor will perform intervention or surgery.\n1. Change your lifestyle\nAdhering to a healthy lifestyle plays an important role in controlling coronary artery stenosis:\nDo not smoke and stay away from cigarette smoke;; Have a heart-healthy diet: low in salt, saturated fat, trans fat and sugar; increase fruits and vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish, skinless poultry;; Exercise regularly: at least 30 minutes a day;; Limit alcohol;; Keep your weight within normal limits, avoid being overweight.\n2. Control risk factors\nGood management of risk factors for coronary artery disease will contribute to slowing the progression of the disease. You need to control the following factors:\nDiabetes; Hypertension; High cholesterol; High triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia); Overweight – obesity\n3. Take medicine\nMedicines help control risk factors and treat symptoms of coronary artery disease. Some commonly prescribed medications are:\nMedicines to lower blood pressure; Cholesterol-lowering drugs; Medicines control stable angina; Medicines to reduce the risk of blood clots\n4. Procedures and surgery\nDepending on the severity of coronary artery stenosis, the doctor will choose the appropriate intervention method, including:\nPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI): Another name for this procedure is angioplasty, which is considered a minimally invasive treatment. The doctor uses a small balloon to expand the clogged vessel (a stent can be placed at the blockage site), helping blood flow better.; Coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG): This is open-heart surgery, helping to create a new \"path\" to restore blood flow to the heart, resolving coronary artery narrowing.\nA percutaneous coronary intervention performed by doctors at the Vascular Intervention Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City.",
