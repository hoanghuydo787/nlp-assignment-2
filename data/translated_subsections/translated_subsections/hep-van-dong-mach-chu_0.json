    "subsection_content": "Aortic valve stenosis is a condition in which the valve cannot open completely. This condition will reduce or block blood flow from the heart (left ventricle) to the body. Initially, the heart will work harder to compensate for the lack of blood flow to the organs in the body. However, at some point, the heart will be overworked, leading to left ventricular myocardial hypertrophy or heart failure. (first)\nAortic valve stenosis is divided into three levels: mild, moderate, and severe stenosis. The greater the degree of aortic valve stenosis, the greater the risk of heart failure.",
