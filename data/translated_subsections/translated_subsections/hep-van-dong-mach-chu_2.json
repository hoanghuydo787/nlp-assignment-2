In children with congenital aortic valve stenosis, from birth, the valve has only 2 pieces, a 1-piece valve, and even a 4-piece valve, but rarely... Over time, the aortic valve in children with congenital defects often degenerates and becomes calcified. mature earlier than normal people.; Rheumatoid arthritis (a complication of sore throat, causing damage to the heart valve): This is an autoimmune disease caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. The disease usually begins with sore throat, lasting about 2 hours. weeks, depending on the health status of each patient. During this time, the body produces its own antibodies to fight the infection. However, because the structure of heart muscles and valves is similar to bacterial cells, the body's immune barrier makes mistakes and attacks, causing damage to the heart valves.",
