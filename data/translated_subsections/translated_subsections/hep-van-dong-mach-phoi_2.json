    "subsection_content": "The disease often occurs when the pulmonary valve does not develop properly during fetal development. Children with this condition are also at risk of other congenital heart diseases. Therefore, if a child is diagnosed with pulmonary valve stenosis, the doctor will recommend that the child undergo additional clinical tests to detect risks to the heart early.\nAdults can also experience this condition due to complications of other diseases. Diseases that are at risk of leading to pulmonary valve narrowing are:\nCarcinoid syndrome: results from the release of a chemical – serotonin – from carcinoid tumors in the digestive system. People with this syndrome will have red skin and diarrhea. (2); Rheumatism: People with rheumatism have infections caused by streptococcus bacteria, such as strep throat, which can damage the heart valves.; Noonan syndrome: This is a genetic disorder that causes patients to have slow physical development, abnormal facial features, and heart defects.",
