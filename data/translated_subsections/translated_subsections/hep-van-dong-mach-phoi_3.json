If you use a stethoscope to clearly hear a heart murmur that sounds like a clicking or hissing sound, it may be an early sign of the disease.\nAfter the initial examination, your doctor may ask you to perform some paraclinical tests to observe the anatomical structure of the heart. These imaging diagnoses include:\nChest X-ray; Electrocardiogram (ECG); Echocardiography; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nThe results obtained from diagnostic imaging will help your doctor accurately conclude the condition of your pulmonary valve ",
