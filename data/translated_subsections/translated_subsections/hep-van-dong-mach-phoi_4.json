    "subsection_content": "If not detected and intervened promptly, pulmonary valve stenosis can lead to dangerous complications (3) such as:\nInfection: People with heart valve problems, such as pulmonary stenosis, have a higher risk of getting a bacterial infection of the endocardium (infectious endocarditis) than people without valve problems heart.; Blood pumping problems: When pulmonary valve stenosis progresses to a severe stage, the right ventricle of the heart must pump harder to push blood into the pulmonary artery. At this time, the right ventricle's task of pumping blood is to counteract the increase in pressure, causing the muscular wall of the ventricle to thicken (right ventricular hypertrophy). This phenomenon will cause the heart to become stiff and gradually weaken.; Heart failure: If the right ventricle cannot pump blood effectively, heart failure will develop, manifested by a series of signs such as swelling of the legs and abdomen, fatigue, difficulty breathing...; Irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia): People with pulmonary valve stenosis are prone to having irregular heart rhythms. This complication is usually not life-threatening, unless the pulmonary valve stenosis is severe.",
