    "subsection_content": "Mitral valve stenosis is an abnormal condition of the mitral heart valve when it cannot open completely to allow blood to flow from the upper left heart chamber (left atrium) to the lower heart chamber (left ventricle). This causes an amount of blood to back up in the left atrium, increasing pressure and causing blood to stagnate in the lungs, causing fatigue and shortness of breath.

In developing countries, the disease often progresses severely in adults, especially women. Unfortunately, the  disease often shows few symptoms, and many patients can endure it. Therefore, when many patients come to the hospital for examination, it is often in the late stage, with very severely narrowed heart valves and heart failure.\"",
