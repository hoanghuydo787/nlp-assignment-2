    "subsection_content": "In developing countries, the cause of mitral stenosis in adults is often rheumatic fever or endocarditis associated with group A hemolytic streptococcus (rheumatic mitral stenosis). This condition causes thickening of the heart valve and leads to valve stenosis after about 5-10 years of disease.\nIn addition, there are a number of other causes leading to mitral valve stenosis in adults such as:\nCalcification of the heart valve ring: calcium accumulates around the valve, causing loss of elasticity and softness, limiting the valve's ability to open; Autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis; Carcinoid tumor endocrine and metabolic syndrome; In young children, mitral valve stenosis is often due to congenital defects such as umbrella-shaped mitral valve, constriction on the valve, or secondary to other congenital heart disease.",
