    "subsection_content": "Mitral valve stenosis often has very few symptoms, the disease progresses slowly over many years, and patients are often only discovered by chance during an echocardiogram. As the disease progresses, the patient needs a cardiovascular examination if one of the following symptoms appears: (2)\nDyspnea on exertion or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea;; Fatigue and easily feel exhausted during strenuous activities such as jogging or climbing stairs;; Swollen feet;; Nervousness, fast heartbeat;; Dizziness or fainting;; Hemoptisi;; Pain and discomfort in the chest area\nSymptoms of the disease will increase in severity when the heart rate increases, especially when the patient exerts himself. Accelerated heart rate may accompany symptoms of mitral stenosis or may be triggered by pregnancy or stress or infection.\nAccording to Doctor II Tran Thi Thanh Truc, in mitral valve stenosis, when the pressure in the heart chamber increases, it will affect the lungs, leading to difficulty breathing and pulmonary congestion. Symptoms of the disease can occur at any age and are common between ages 15-40.\nDuring examination, doctors will detect mitral valve stenosis through:\nHeart murmur; Pulmonary congestion; Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)",
