Primary\nThe primary stage of Herpes disease occurs from a few days to a few weeks after the patient comes into contact with the source of infection. Symptoms at this stage are similar to those of the flu, including:\nSwollen lymph nodes.; Headache, body aches; Tired.; Fever.; Anorexia.; The patient notices tingling, burning, and small blisters in some areas of the body. The blisters can grow in clusters or spread into patches. These blisters will burst and crust over after a while.\nNote:\nIt can take patients about 6 weeks to completely heal the blisters that appear in the primary stage. Before completely healing, these blisters can still transmit the virus to others.; The blisters cause pain and itching in the area where they appear. Herpes in the genitals causes a sharp pain when the patient urinates.\n2. Recurrence\nSome people infected with the Herpes virus have only one outbreak. While some others experience a recurrence every few months or so.\nRelapses occur less frequently over time after the patient's body begins to produce antibodies against the virus. Symptoms in the relapse phase are also less severe and improve quickly: Blisters appear less frequently, pain is reduced and can heal completely after just a few days.",
