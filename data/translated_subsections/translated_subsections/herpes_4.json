    "subsection_content": "HSV-2 infection triples the risk of HIV infection\nDepending on the stage, Herpes may or may not be dangerous. Some potential complications of the disease are:\n1. Increase the possibility of HIV transmission\nHSV-2 infection triples the risk of HIV infection. Additionally, people infected with both HIV and HSV-2 are more likely to transmit HIV to others. HSV-2 infection is one of the most common infections in people with HIV.\n2. Serious complications\nIn immunocompromised people, including those with advanced HIV infection, herpes may have more severe symptoms and recur more often. Rare complications of HSV-2 include meningitis (brain infection) and disseminated infection. HSV-1 infection can lead to more severe complications such as encephalitis (brain infection) or keratitis (eye infection).\n3. Herpes in newborns\nHerpes in newborns can occur when a newborn is exposed to HSV in the womb. Herpes in newborns is rare, estimated to occur in 10 out of every 100 000 births globally. However, this is a serious condition that can lead to neurological disability or death. The risk of herpes in newborns is greatest when the mother is infected with HSV for the first time late in pregnancy.",
