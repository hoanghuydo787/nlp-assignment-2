People infected with the Herpes simplex virus can transmit the virus to others through blisters or sores after the blisters break.\nHowever, many people infected with the Herpes virus can still infect others even without symptoms. Experts call this asymptomatic viral shedding.\nRoutes of transmission of HSV-1 virus include:\nKissing.; Touch the skin near the patient's mouth; Sharing personal items such as razors, lip balm, and eating utensils; Have oral sex with the sick person.\nRoutes of transmission of HSV-2 virus include:\nIntercourse through the anus, vaginal-penis and vaginal-vaginal intercourse; Having oral sex with someone infected with the Herpes virus; Skin-to-skin contact; Touching the patient's open sores; Newborns whose mothers are or have been infected with the Herpes virus are at risk of being infected in the womb or while breastfeeding.; Herpes cannot be transmitted through sharing a toilet.
