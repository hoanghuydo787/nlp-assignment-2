The doctor will examine the blistered skin and ask the patient about some signs such as tingling, burning or flu-like symptoms.\nIn many cases, doctors prescribe specimen testing for a more accurate diagnosis. Specimens include fluid in connective tissue suspected of being infected such as the nose, mouth, throat, vagina, anus, rectum and fluid in blisters.\nIn case the patient has been exposed to HSV but has not yet detected symptoms, performing a blood test can help determine whether HSV antibodies exist in the body. However, it should be noted that blood tests may not accurately detect HSV antibodies during the first 12 weeks after a person is infected with the virus.\nNote: General STI screening usually does not include HSV testing. So if you suspect you have been infected with the virus, you need to talk to a dermatologist for advice about testing for HSV.",
