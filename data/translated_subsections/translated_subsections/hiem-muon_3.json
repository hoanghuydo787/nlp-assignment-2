    "subsection_content": "The fertility of men and women decreases with age. For women, fertility gradually decreases when they turn 30, and decreases rapidly after age 35. By age 40, a woman's chance of getting pregnant is reduced by half. The reason is that as women get older, the quantity and quality of eggs in both ovaries decrease significantly.\nAge affects fertility, partly because the quality of the released ovum declines. By age 40, about 75% of all oocytes have chromosomal abnormalities, which reduces the chance of pregnancy and increases the risk of miscarriage. Here are a few numbers that show the relationship between a woman's age and fertility:\nThe monthly chance of conceiving drops from 20% for women in their 30s to 5% for women in their 40s.; The risk of chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus increases from 1 in 385 for women in their 30s to 1 in 63 for women in their 40s; Miscarriage occurs in <10% of women in their 20s, while it occurs in >50% of women over 42 years of age.\nIn men, the decline in fertility begins later and is less noticeable but still occurs silently. A husband over 45 years old takes 5 times longer for his wife to get pregnant than a man in his 20s.\nTherefore, couples who are expecting children should not delay the examination for too long, avoid missing the golden time in treatment to achieve the best results. Couples under 35 years old who have been trying to have a baby for at least a year, or over 35 years old who have been trying for a baby for 6 months without results, should see a fertility specialist. receive infertility consultation and examination.",
