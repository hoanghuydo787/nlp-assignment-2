    "subsection_content": "Mitral valve regurgitation is a condition in which the valve leaflets do not close tightly, causing blood to reflux from the left ventricle to the left atrium when the heart contracts. Because the amount of blood refluxing into the left atrium plus the normal amount of blood returning from the lungs increases blood flow in the left heart, the result is enlargement of the left atrium and left ventricle if the valve regurgitation is severe and prolonged.\nNormally the human heart has 4 chambers, 2 atria above and 4 ventricles below, separated by the tricuspid valve (right) and mitral valve (left). The mitral valve is the valve connecting the left atrium and the left ventricle. The valve consists of an anterior leaflet and a posterior leaflet (2 leaflets) that press together to help the valve open and close, sending blood in one direction from the left atrium to the left ventricle.\nMitral valve regurgitation is a condition in which the valve leaflets do not close tightly, causing blood to reflux from the left ventricle to the left atrium when the heart contracts.",
