    "subsection_content": "Mitral valve regurgitation has many different degrees, assessed based on echocardiography and cardiac chamber contrast imaging (cardiac catheterization). The common way to evaluate the severity of mitral valve regurgitation is based on echocardiography, divided into 4 degrees:\nMitral regurgitation 1/4: mild or very mild degree of valve regurgitation; Mitral regurgitation 2/4: moderate level of valve regurgitation; 3/4 mitral regurgitation: severe valve regurgitation; Mitral regurgitation 4/4: very severe valve regurgitation.\nA famous American Framingham Heart Study showed that, in normal people, when doing echocardiography, 75 - 80% have mild valve regurgitation (1/4); About 19% are moderate to severe (2/4 - 3/4) and severe to very severe (3/4 - 4/4) is about 3.5%. The incidence of the disease increases as people get older.\nPatients with severe mitral valve regurgitation but without symptoms, according to disease progression, 50% will develop symptoms after 5 years.; Patients with severe mitral regurgitation who were indicated for surgery but did not perform it and only received medical treatment have a 5-year survival rate of only 30%.",
