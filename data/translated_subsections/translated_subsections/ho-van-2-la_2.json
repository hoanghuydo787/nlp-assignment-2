    "subsection_content": "The structure of the mitral valve apparatus includes the annulus, leaflets, ligaments, and ulnar muscle. Abnormalities that occur due to damage to any component of the valve apparatus can cause disease. Common causes of mitral valve regurgitation are:\nRheumatic mitral valve regurgitation: common in our country, caused by rheumatic heart disease in adolescents (5 - 15 years old) leaving sequelae of valve regurgitation that progresses later. Low posterior mitral regurgitation is often accompanied by mitral valve stenosis or other heart valve stenosis or regurgitation. Severe valve regurgitation usually occurs between 30 and 60 years old; Mucosal degeneration: common in middle-aged to elderly people, the valve leaflets become thickened and loose, causing valve leaflet prolapse or ligament rupture, causing the valve leaflet to flip into the left atrium, causing severe valve regurgitation.; Calcium degeneration: common in the elderly, with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The valve annulus and valve leaflets are calcified, restricting leaflet movement, causing the valve to not close tightly.; Congenital: due to congenital abnormalities of the mitral valve such as a prolapsed valve, a split valve between the valve leaflets, or an abnormally short valve ligament. The disease is common in children and adolescents.; Infection on the heart valve (also known as infective endocarditis): bacteria that attack the valve leaflet can puncture and tear the valve, break ligaments or create large warts on the valve leaflet, hindering the opening and closing of the valve.; Myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia: due to abnormal contraction of the heart wall, rupture of the ulnar muscle, ligament due to lack of blood supply, left ventricular dilatation after infarction.; Dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: due to dilated valve ring, abnormal left ventricular contraction or abnormal pressure in the heart chamber.\nMitral valve regurgitation due to valve prolapse",
