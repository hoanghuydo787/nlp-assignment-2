    "subsection_content": "There are 4 stages of the disease ranging from mild to severe:\nStage A: patients are at risk of mitral valve regurgitation, commonly found in people with mitral valve prolapse, hypertension, and chronic coronary artery disease. On echocardiography, there is mild mitral valve regurgitation, the heart chambers are not dilated, and heart function is good. Patients have almost no symptoms of the disease; Stage B: the disease progresses more rapidly, often occurring in people with rheumatic valve disease, cardiomyopathy, and mitral valve prolapse. On ultrasound, the valve regurgitation was found to be moderate or higher, the heart chambers were slightly dilated, heart function was good and the patient had no symptoms of mitral regurgitation.; Stage C: the disease is severe but the patient has no symptoms of the disease. On echocardiography, the valve regurgitation is 3/4 - 4/4, the left ventricle and left atrium are enlarged, the pulmonary artery pressure is normal or increased, and the heart function begins to change.; Stage D: severe mitral valve regurgitation and the patient has symptoms of heart failure, decreased ability to exercise and difficulty breathing. On echocardiography, valvular regurgitation is grade 3/4 or higher, dilation of the left ventricle and left atrium, pulmonary hypertension, and reduced left ventricular contractile function.",
