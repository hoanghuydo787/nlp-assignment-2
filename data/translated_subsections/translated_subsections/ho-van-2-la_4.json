    "subsection_content": "Symptoms of the disease depend on the severity of the valve regurgitation, the degree of progression and the cause of the valve regurgitation. Patients with mild to moderate disease usually do not cause symptoms.\nAcute mitral valve regurgitation due to acute myocardial infarction or ligament rupture often causes massive and severe symptoms. The patient suddenly has chest pain, severe difficulty breathing, and sometimes goes into cardiogenic shock. Symptoms of chronic mitral valve regurgitation often progress slowly. Common symptoms of severe valve regurgitation are:\nChronic fatigue, reduced ability to exercise;; Chest pain, nervousness, and shortness of breath are common in people with mitral valve regurgitation due to valve prolapse;; Angina if mitral regurgitation occurs due to myocardial ischemia;; Shortness of breath when doing light work, wheezing, gradually worsening to shortness of breath when lying with head down, paroxysmal shortness of breath at night when lying down, sudden difficulty breathing, having to sit up, open windows, walk around to breathe;; Dry cough, coughing up blood or sputum with pink foam;; Nervousness, rapid and irregular heartbeat due to atrial fibrillation;; Swollen feet.",
