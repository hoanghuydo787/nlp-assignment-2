Sometimes valve regurgitation does not progress after many years of monitoring, the disease progresses slowly, however there are also cases of sudden severe regurgitation causing symptoms similar to when a ligament rupture occurs.; Mitral valve regurgitation often progresses more rapidly in connective tissue diseases such as Marfan syndrome, compared with regurgitation due to mucus degeneration or rheumatism.; Patients with severe asymptomatic valve regurgitation progress to symptoms, left ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension and atrial fibrillation at a rate of 30% - 50% after 5 years.; Severe mitral regurgitation due to ligament rupture if treated medically, without surgery, the survival rate after 20 years is only 40%.",
