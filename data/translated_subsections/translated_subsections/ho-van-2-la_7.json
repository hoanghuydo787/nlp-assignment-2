    "subsection_content": "Severe mitral valve regurgitation, if not treated appropriately, will cause many life-threatening complications in the long term. Complications include:\nHeart failure is the final consequence of the disease. Long-term mitral valve regurgitation leads to dilatation of the left atrium and left ventricle. The left ventricle must work hard to pump nearly double the amount of blood than normal, and over time it will become exhausted. At some point, the blood pumping function is severely reduced and can no longer be compensated, and the patient will have symptoms of heart failure such as fatigue and shortness of breath. When the patient has severe left ventricular dysfunction, ejection fraction (blood pumping ability) < 20%, the prognosis is poor, survival time is short, surgery is almost impossible because of mortality and complications. Symptoms during surgery were high, after surgery cardiac function did not return to normal.; Atrial fibrillation is a very common complication. In severe mitral valve regurgitation, the left atrial leaflet is often greatly dilated due to the amount of blood refluxing. Over time, the normal contraction function of the atrium is lost. The patient's heart suffers from atrial fibrillation, which means that the patient's heart has atrial fibrillation. The normal function of the atria is to contract and bring blood from the atria to the ventricles. Now it only \"vibrates\" and can no longer \"contract\" regularly. The consequences of atrial fibrillation reduce the amount of blood going to the left ventricle, patients have more symptoms of heart failure; Atrial fibrillation causes the heart to beat irregularly, causing the patient to have additional symptoms of nervousness; Reduced blood flow from the atria to the ventricles increases blood stasis, easily creating blood clots in the atria. These blood clots drift through the bloodstream and can cause blood vessel blockages in many places, most commonly brain blood clots causing strokes, blood clots in the legs causing lack of blood supply to the legs, paralysis or necrosis of the legs, and blood clots in the legs. abdominal cavity causes intestinal necrosis...; Sudden death can occur in patients with severe heart failure and coronary artery disease. In addition, sudden death can occur in people with mitral valve prolapse at a very rare rate, 0.14% per year. The risk of sudden death in mitral valve prolapse increases when both valve leaflets prolapse, there is ventricular myocardial fibrosis, there are many ventricular extrasystoles and ST-T wave abnormalities on electrocardiography.; Death is the ultimate outcome due to severe irreversible heart failure or severe ischemic stroke.",
