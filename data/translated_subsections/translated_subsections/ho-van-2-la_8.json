    "subsection_content": "Treatment methods for mitral valve regurgitation are chosen depending on the severity of the disease.\nMild mitral valve regurgitation does not require specific treatment, just periodic ultrasound monitoring every year to monitor the progression of the disease.; Moderate or higher mitral regurgitation requires finding the cause to treat and intervene to prevent the progression of mitral regurgitation.; Cases of severe mitral valve regurgitation (3/4 - 4/4), with functional symptoms, enlarged heart chambers, reduced heart function require surgical treatment or heart valve replacement.\nMedical treatment (medication)\nUse antibiotics to prevent recurrent rheumatic heart disease long-term (up to age 40 or more) if mitral valve regurgitation is due to rheumatism.; Periodic dental examination and treatment every 6 months to prevent infection on the mitral valve. The cause of infection on the heart valve is that 75% of germs from the oropharynx and inflamed teeth enter the bloodstream and stick to the damaged heart valve, causing inflammation or valve abscess, causing more serious valve damage. .; Treatment of medical diseases with high risk of leading to heart valve regurgitation such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy...; Treat heart failure if the patient has symptoms or impaired heart function on echocardiography. Medications to treat heart failure include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or ARNI (Sacubitril + Valsartan), beta blockers, and diuretics. If the patient has atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, it is necessary to use antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, clopidogrel, ticagrelor, prasugrel) or cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins, ezetimibe).; Patients with atrial fibrillation need to use drugs to slow down the heart rate such as beta blockers and anticoagulants to prevent thrombosis causing embolism.; Vaccinate against influenza every year and against pneumococcal pneumonia every 5 years for all patients with severe valve regurgitation and heart failure.\nInterventional treatment\nWhen a patient with severe mitral regurgitation has symptoms of heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, early intervention is needed because if surgery is delayed, the disease will become more severe, surgical complications will be higher, and full recovery will not be possible. despite having heart valve surgery. Interventional treatment includes surgery (artificial valve repair or replacement) and percutaneous valve repair.\nValve repair surgery is preferred if the valve structure is suitable for repair. In cases where the valve is severely damaged or has too much calcification that cannot be repaired, an artificial valve must be replaced. After artificial valve replacement, the patient needs to take anticoagulants to prevent blood clots from blocking the valve. For biological valves, the duration of oral anticoagulation is 3 months if there is no atrial fibrillation. If the mechanical valve is replaced or the patient has atrial fibrillation, he or she should take anticoagulants for life.; Percutaneous mitral valve repair (MitraClip): The doctor inserts a catheter through a blood vessel in the thigh into the left atrium, down to the left ventricle, then inserts a metal clip between the two edges of the valve at the leak and clamps it. This method does not repair the valve as thoroughly as open heart surgery. It is only applied in cases where the patient is seriously ill and cannot have surgery. After receiving maximum medical treatment, heart failure symptoms do not decrease and must be hospitalized many times.\nPercutaneous mitral valve repair (MitraClip)\nMitral valve repair and valve ring placement through surgery\nCan a leaky mitral valve be cured with treatment?\nMild mitral regurgitation: may not progress further. Therefore, patients should not worry too much. They only need to be monitored annually, adjust their healthy lifestyle, and treat accompanying chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes to help prevent progressive valve regurgitation. .; Post-rheumatic moderate mitral regurgitation requires long-term rheumatism prevention to avoid rheumatism from recurring and the regurgitation does not progress further; coronary stent angioplasty if valve regurgitation is due to myocardial ischemia; Severe valve regurgitation can be cured by surgical repair or replacement of an artificial valve. After surgery, the function of the mitral valve recovers almost completely. However, patients still need to take medication and follow up regularly with a specialist. Proper treatment after heart abutment helps limit disease recurrence. Patients after surgery to repair or replace the mechanical mitral valve can live another 20 - 30 years or more depending on each person's health status and long-term care after heart surgery.",
