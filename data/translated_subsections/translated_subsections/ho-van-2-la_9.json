    "subsection_content": "Patients with mitral valve regurgitation will be monitored and treated with medication first. If severe valve regurgitation is accompanied by one of the following, surgical repair or valve replacement is required:\nSymptoms of heart failure: decreased ability to exercise, fatigue, shortness of breath when doing light work, shortness of breath when lying with head low, paroxysmal difficulty breathing at night;; There was an irregular heartbeat, an electrocardiogram detected atrial fibrillation;; On routine echocardiography, ejection fraction decreased < 50%, left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD) ≥ 40mm, and severe pulmonary hypertension. Patients can ask their doctor about these indicators if they are unclear or have questions.; Severe mitral valve regurgitation but no symptoms of heart failure or arrhythmia. Echocardiography every 6 months to 1 year shows that the heart chambers are gradually dilated and the ejection fraction is gradually decreasing. Surgery should also be considered with treatment. condition that the doctor's ability to repair the valve is > 95% and the risk of surgical complications is low < 1%.; Severe valve regurgitation, ejection fraction < 20%, left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD) ≤ 70mm almost no longer require surgery.\nTherefore, patients need to be monitored periodically and advise the doctor on when is the appropriate time for surgery. Surgery too early is not necessary, but too late and the results are not good.\nDepending on the severity of mitral valve regurgitation, the doctor will prescribe the appropriate treatment method and duration.\nIs it better to replace a mechanical valve or a biological valve?\nChoosing to replace a biological valve or a mechanical valve depends on the individual characteristics of each patient (age, comorbidities, contraindications to anticoagulants, etc.) and the patient's wishes after being informed by the doctor. Provide adequate information, exchange and share decisions with patients. Some points to note when choosing a biological valve or a mechanical valve:\nMechanical valve: valve made of metal, has a long lifespan (valve life), 20 years or more, but must take vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants (Sintrom, Coumadine) for life to prevent Thrombosis causes valve obstruction; Biological valve: made from pig heart valve, cow pericardium or autologous valve. Over time the valve will degenerate and lose function. The younger the person, the faster the valve degeneration. With current improvements, biological valves have a longer lifespan, on average 10-15 years, but not as long as mechanical valves. The advantage of a biological valve is that the patient does not need to take anticoagulants long-term, avoiding complications due to the use of anticoagulants, but the patient faces the risk of re-operation after 10-15 years of valve replacement.\nWho should prioritize choosing a biological valve?\nPatients ≥ 65 years old: the risk of valve degeneration requiring re-operation in people over 70 years old after 15 years is < 10%.; Patients with contraindications to using anticoagulants; or live in a place that is not qualified to monitor blood coagulation (remote areas, islands...) or the patient does not accept long-term anticoagulation.; Women who are still of childbearing age, want to have children, and do not want to take anticoagulants during pregnancy. After having a biological valve replaced, the patient gets pregnant and gives birth, then accepts surgery to replace the valve after 5-7 years if the valve is seriously damaged. Pregnancy often causes biological valves to degenerate and fail faster than usual.\nWho should prioritize mechanical valve replacement?\nPatients < 65 years old, with an estimated remaining life expectancy (over 20 years), without contraindications to using anticoagulants, should replace the mechanical valve for longer use.; Patients with other indications for anticoagulation treatment such as atrial fibrillation, cardiac thrombosis, etc.; Patients have the ability to self-monitor INR and adjust medications at home.\nHow should I monitor after mitral valve surgery?\nIssues that need to be monitored after mitral valve surgery include:\nAfter valve repair surgery: monitor for recurrent valve regurgitation and heart valve infection;; After biological valve replacement: monitor valve degeneration, recurrent valve regurgitation, heart valve infection;; After mechanical valve replacement: monitor valve jamming due to thrombosis, valve prolapse, and infection on the artificial valve.\nFor good monitoring, patients need:\nTake medicine regularly and have regular check-ups;; Echocardiogram: immediately after cardiac surgery, 3rd, 6th and 1st month after surgery, then every year or when symptoms of fatigue or shortness of breath appear;; Patients taking vitamin K antagonists need to periodically measure INR every 1-3 months and at follow-up visits to adjust the drug dose so that the INR is within the highest therapeutic range (target INR 2.5 - 3.5).; Patients suspected of having signs of valve obstruction need to have a transesophageal echocardiogram, cardiac CT scan or valve examination under a fluorescent screen to determine and find the cause.",
