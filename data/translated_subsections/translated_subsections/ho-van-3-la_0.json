    "subsection_content": "Tricuspid valve regurgitation is a condition that occurs when the valve does not close tightly. That is, after the right atrium pumps blood into the right ventricle, the valve leaflet does not close tightly, causing blood to flow back into the atrium - where it was just pumped. Over time, severe tricuspid valve regurgitation, if not treated properly, will lead to right ventricular dysfunction and then total heart failure. (first)",
