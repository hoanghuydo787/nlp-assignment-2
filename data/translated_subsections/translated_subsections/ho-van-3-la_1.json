    "subsection_content": "Depending on the severity of the condition, tricuspid valve regurgitation is divided into 4 levels:\nTricuspid regurgitation 1/4: This is the mildest level of the disease, has no obvious symptoms and is not dangerous, so no treatment is needed.; 2/4 tricuspid regurgitation: This condition does not necessarily need to be treated because it is of moderate severity. However, patients need to have follow-up examinations as advised by the doctor to monitor the progression of the disease. If symptoms of difficulty breathing, fatigue, rapid heartbeat, etc. appear, the patient needs to be treated according to the appropriate regimen.; 3/4 tricuspid regurgitation: At this stage, the patient will feel difficulty breathing and shortness of breath with increasing severity, causing difficulty in work and daily activities. 3/4 tricuspid regurgitation can still be treated medically, but doctors can consider appropriate surgical methods to prevent the disease from getting worse.; 4/4 tricuspid valve regurgitation: This is the most severe level of heart valve regurgitation with very serious symptoms and the patient is almost unable to work/live as usual. If the patient's symptoms do not improve after taking medication, the doctor will consider surgical heart valve repair or artificial heart valve replacement.",
