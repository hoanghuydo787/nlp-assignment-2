    "subsection_content": "There are many causes of tricuspid valve regurgitation, the most common of which is right ventricular dilation. The right ventricle is responsible for pumping blood from the heart to the lungs. When the right ventricle is forced to work harder, it needs to increase in size and increase its force of contraction, gradually causing the right heart chamber to dilate. As a result, the tissue ring that supports the tricuspid valve's ability to open and close is also dilated.
