    "subsection_content": "If you are experiencing any of the above symptoms, your doctor may suspect that you have tricuspid valve regurgitation, especially if you have other conditions or risk factors associated with the condition. . (4)\nDiagnosis of tricuspid valve regurgitation often begins with a comprehensive physical examination. The doctor will use a stethoscope to listen to your heart murmur. If you notice unusual sounds, it is most likely a sign that blood is flowing backward. At that time, you will be prescribed the following diagnostic imaging or methods to accurately determine the medical condition:\nElectrocardiogram: measures the electrical impulses of the heart;; Chest X-ray to evaluate the size and shape of the heart as well as the condition of the lungs;; Echocardiography: observe the structure of the heart;; Transesophageal echocardiography: For this method, the doctor will insert a tiny tube with an ultrasound emitter into the digestive tract running from the mouth to the esophagus (near the heart). Thanks to that, detailed images of the heart appear clearly, helping to accurately detect heart valve damage;; Cardiac catheterization: This method is used to determine the cause of tricuspid valve regurgitation. A (small) catheter is inserted into the groin, arm or neck and guided to the heart by X-ray imaging. Contrast dye injected through the catheter allows the doctor to see blood flow through the heart, vessels, and valves;; MRI scan: The magnetic field and radio waves from the MRI machine help create detailed images of the heart;; Exercise or stress tests: These tests help determine the heart's ability to withstand exercise as well as measure the heart's response to exertion;\nBicycle stress echocardiography can help detect abnormalities in the heart.",
