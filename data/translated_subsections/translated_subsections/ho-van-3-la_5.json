    "subsection_content": "Physiological tricuspid regurgitation and mild regurgitation are not life-threatening if well controlled. However, if the disease is not properly monitored and treated, it will prolong and progress to moderate and severe levels, causing serious complications such as:\nHeart failure: In severe cases of tricuspid regurgitation, blood flows backward into the right atrium and less blood flows forward through the right ventricle into the lungs. This increases pressure on the right ventricle, causing it to dilate (increase in size) and weaken over time, leading to heart failure.; Atrial fibrillation: Some severe patients may have a heart rhythm disorder, called atrial fibrillation.",
