    "subsection_content": "As mentioned above, there are cases of tricuspid valve regurgitation that do not require treatment (mild valve regurgitation). Instead, you need to check your heart health regularly to make sure the disease does not get worse. For people with severe symptoms, doctors will prescribe treatment with medication or surgery. Which treatment method to apply will depend on the cause and extent of the leak.\nSome special medications that doctors prescribe for patients with tricuspid valve regurgitation are:\nDiuretic; Antiarrhythmic drugs; Cardiac drugs; Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; Anticoagulants\nIf after a period of taking medication, the disease does not improve and tends to get worse, the doctor will consider one of the following surgical methods:\n1. Repair heart valves\nThe doctor will repair the heart valve by repairing the valve leaflets and sewing small valve rings so they can close tightly, preventing blood from flowing back.\n2. Replace heart valves\nThe damaged valve will be removed and replaced with a mechanical valve or biological valve (made from cow, pig or human heart tissue). Mechanical valves have the advantage of not degenerating, but they can easily form blood clots, causing blockages. Therefore, patients need to take anticoagulants for life to prevent blood clots from forming. Meanwhile, biological valves are susceptible to degeneration over time, meaning the valve's lifespan is shorter, in return there is less risk of blood clots forming.",
