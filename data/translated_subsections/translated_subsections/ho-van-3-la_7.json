    "subsection_content": "The most effective way to prevent tricuspid valve regurgitation is to manage potential risk factors, such as rheumatoid arthritis, infective endocarditis, and Marfan syndrome.\nIf you have strep throat, you also need thorough treatment. Because persistent sore throat can lead to rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease - a cause of this condition.\nAlso, talk to your doctor before you take any new medication. Some medications may increase the risk of tricuspid valve regurgitation.\nLifestyle and diet for patients with tricuspid valve regurgitation\nIn addition to complying with your doctor's treatment regimen, adjusting your diet, exercise, and scientific lifestyle also contributes to preventing tricuspid valve regurgitation from progressing. Specifically, patients need:\nMaintain a reasonable weight: Overweight and obesity increase the risk of hypertension and coronary artery disease. These are the reasons why your heart works harder, leading to weakness. Therefore, see if your body mass index (BMI) is within the allowable limit (18.5 - 22.9). If BMI is 23 or higher, you need to plan to lose weight as soon as possible.; Don't smoke: Nicotine and other chemicals in cigarettes (including e-cigarettes) are considered \"silent enemies\", causing damage to the lungs and heart. Quit smoking immediately if you have smoked for many years and avoid inhaling secondhand smoke (passive smoking).; Limit or avoid alcohol: Alcohol can increase the risk of high blood pressure, liver problems and coronary artery disease. Therefore, you need to ask your doctor whether you can drink alcohol or not, and how much alcohol to drink without affecting your health.; Add heart-healthy foods: This food group includes salmon, tuna, walnuts, whole-wheat bread, low-fat dairy products, legumes, olive oil or canola oil. At the same time, limit eating foods that can make your condition worse such as red meat (beef, goat meat, pork...), fast food (hamburgers, fried chicken, French fries, etc.). hotdog...), processed foods (sausages, ham, bacon...), drinks and foods high in sugar (carbonated soft drinks, cakes, ice cream, tea...), foods high in cholesterol ( margarine, nuts, shellfish, popcorn...).\nA heart-friendly diet is the key to improving cardiovascular disease symptoms\nLimit sodium (salt) in your diet: Consuming too much sodium will increase the risk of high blood pressure and cause tricuspid valve regurgitation to progress. Therefore, patients need to minimize the amount of salt in their daily diet. Some habits such as checking food labels (especially canned foods) before buying or prioritizing eating at home and minimizing the number of times you eat out also help control sodium intake effectively.; Exercise as directed: Regular exercise is a way to maintain heart health. However, before exercising, you need to consult your doctor to know which exercises are suitable and how long to practice. This helps prevent risks that may occur when practicing with incorrect technique, over-exercising, inappropriate movements...; If you have a procedure to treat a medical condition, ask your doctor whether you should take antibiotics before and after surgery. Some procedures have the potential to cause bacteria to enter the bloodstream and travel to the heart. This is very dangerous and can make the condition worse; Get vaccinated as recommended by your doctor: Diseases such as influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia, hepatitis B... can potentially threaten patients.
