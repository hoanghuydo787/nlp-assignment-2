Because Brugada syndrome is a genetic condition passed from generation to generation, if someone in your family has had Brugada, you should be screened to see if you have the disease (family includes parents, your siblings and children).\nIf someone in your family has been diagnosed with Brugada disease, you should see a doctor who specializes in arrhythmia for advice. You may have some screening tests to help your doctor assess your risk of the disease and advise on appropriate treatment.",
