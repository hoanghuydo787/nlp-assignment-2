This genetic test should also be offered to other family members of the patient.; Electrophysiological examination of the heart: a doctor specializing in arrhythmia will use electrodes inserted into the heart chambers to examine and check to see if any dangerous ventricular arrhythmias have been triggered. Depending on the survey results, your doctor will recommend the next appropriate treatment for you.\nCardiac electrophysiological testing is one of the methods to diagnose Brugada Syndrome.",
