    "subsection_content": "Fournier Syndrome also known as Fournier Gangrene (Perineal Diffuse Necrotizing Infection) is a rare but potentially life-threatening bacterial infection that requires urgent medical intervention. The disease tends to progress rapidly on the genitals and surrounding areas (penis, perineum...), causing tissue destruction, even leading to many other dangerous complications. (first)\nIn some severe cases, the infection can spread to the thighs, stomach, and chest. From there, muscles, nerves and arteries in these areas are at high risk of being destroyed. Many studies conclude that 3% of patients with Fournier are likely to die.\nMeanwhile, some other reports have determined that this number has reached 50%. Fournier is usually detected in men between the ages of 50 and 60 years old, with a small number of cases also occurring in women and children. However, this syndrome is very rare and can be proactively prevented from the beginning or monitored and detected early for effective treatment.",
