    "subsection_content": "1. Surgery\nThis is the treatment method that is always the number one priority for Fournier syndrome. In many cases, doctors will skip the diagnostic process and go straight to surgery. At this time, necrotic damaged tissues will be removed from the body to prevent bacteria from spreading. There are a few cases where the entire penis has to be removed, but it is very rare.\nAfter surgery, your doctor will prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics and other additional medications if you have sepsis to reduce the risk of blood clots. In addition, the patient also needs to undergo reconstructive surgery to shape the perineum, penis... back to their original shape as before Fournier's disease.\n2. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy\nWith hyperbaric oxygen therapy, the body will be exposed to 100% oxygen, while normally it is only about 21%. The additional oxygen prevents bacteria from growing, reduces blood vessel damage and speeds up the wound healing process. However, up to now, this therapy is still controversial so it is not recommended for widespread use.\n3. Antibiotics\nBroad-spectrum antibiotics are often prescribed for early use in patients with Fournier disease. Some typical types include: (4)\nVancomycin: This is a powerful antibiotic, effective against gram-positive bacteria and intestinal bacteria. Vancomycin is indicated for use in cases where Penicillin, Cephalosporin cannot be used or there is an infection with drug-resistant staphylococci.; Ampicillin-sulbactam sodium: This is a combination of drugs that use a Beta-lactamase inhibitor with Ampicillin. However, Ampicillin-sulbactam sodium needs to be used with caution in patients allergic to Cephalosporin and Carbapenem, and the dose needs to be adjusted accordingly in people with kidney failure.; Ticarcillin and clavulanate potassium: This is a Penicillin plus Beta-lactamase inhibitor, containing 4.7-5 mEq of sodium per gram, providing protection against most gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria; Piperacillin and tazobactam: This is a combination of Penicillin and Beta-lactamase, which inhibits Mucopeptide biosynthesis of bacterial cell walls.; Gentamicin: This is a form of Aminoglycoside antibiotic, effective against gram-positive bacteria and anaerobic bacteria.; Metronidazole (Flagyl): Metronidazole is an Imidazole ring antibiotic, active against anaerobic bacteria. The drug is often prescribed for use in combination with other antibacterial agents. Metronidazole  is normally absorbed into the cells of microorganisms containing Nitroreductase. Then, intermediate compounds are formed that bind DNA and destroy cells.; Clindamycin (Cleocin): Clindamycin is a form of Lincosamide that is effective in treating skin and soft tissue infections caused by aerobic and anaerobic staphylococci and streptococci. The drug will inhibit the protein synthesis process of bacteria, thereby preventing the growth of this group of microorganisms.",
