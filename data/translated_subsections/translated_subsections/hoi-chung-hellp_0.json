    "subsection_content": "HELLP syndrome is a disorder related to preeclampsia that, if not treated promptly, can cause death. HELLP is a common form of pregnancy toxemia in 5-8% of pregnant women, most commonly after week 20 of pregnancy. Symptoms of HELLP are often quite vague, broad and difficult to recognize and diagnose early.\nMany studies have long shown that preeclampsia may be associated with symptoms of hemolysis, increased liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia. Dr. Louis Weinstein considers those constituent signs and symptoms to constitute an entity separate from severe preeclampsia. In 1982 he named the condition HELLP syndrome after its characteristics: (1)\nH – Hemolysis (hemolysis); EL – Elevated liver enzymes (increased liver enzymes); LP – Low platelets (thrombocytopenia)\nThe syndrome can be difficult to diagnose, especially in the absence of high blood pressure and protein in the urine. Symptoms of HELLP are sometimes confused with gastritis, flu, acute hepatitis, gallbladder disease or other trimester conditions.\n70% of women with HELLP syndrome occur before giving birth and 30% occur within 48 hours to 7 days after birth. 20% of women with this syndrome after giving birth had no signs of eclampsia before giving birth. Recurrence rates in subsequent pregnancies are 3% for HELLP, 10-14% for IUGR (intrauterine growth retardation) and 18-20% for pre-eclampsia.\nMortality rates from this syndrome have been reported to be as high as 30%. That is why pregnant mothers need to be aware of the condition and its symptoms so they can intervene and treat it early.",
