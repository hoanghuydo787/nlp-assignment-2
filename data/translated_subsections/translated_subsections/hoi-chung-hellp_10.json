    "subsection_content": "1. How does HELLP syndrome affect newborns?\nSome studies show that newborn babies weighing less than 2,000 grams born to infected mothers need to stay in the hospital longer and may require ventilator care. In developed countries, the rate of stillbirth (baby death in the uterus after 20 weeks) is 51/1,000 pregnancies. This rate is higher than both severe preeclampsia and eclampsia.\nOverall perinatal mortality \\ (stillbirth plus neonatal death) ranges from 7.7% – 60%. Most of these deaths are believed to be due to placental abruption (the placenta separates prematurely from the uterus), placental abruption due to intrauterine asphyxia (the fetus does not receive enough oxygen), and premature birth.\n2. What is the risk of getting HELLP in the next pregnancy?\nThe risk of recurrence of all forms of preeclampsia is HIGHER in women with a history of the condition. The rate of preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancies ranges from 16 – 52%, with higher rates if HELLP syndrome develops in the second trimester. The HELLP recurrence rate ranges from 2 - 19% depending on the patient population studied.\nAccompanying mothers from pregnancy to labor, Tam Anh General Hospital provides comprehensive health care services such as full maternity, on-demand maternity, pre- and post-natal care,...
