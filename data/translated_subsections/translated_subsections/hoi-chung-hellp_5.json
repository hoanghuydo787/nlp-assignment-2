    "subsection_content": "Diagnosis of the disease can be based on 3 main characteristics (4), including:\nHemolysis: occurs due to the transport of red blood cells within damaged blood capillaries. Common symptoms are broken red blood cell fragments and deformed red blood cells (schistocytes) on blood smears. Haptoglobin, bilirubin, LDH increased; Increased liver enzymes: is anemia in the liver leading to infarction. These lesions have symptoms such as epigastric pain, vomiting, nausea or right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes. Severe complications (1%) that may occur are hematoma under the liver capsule, even rupture into the abdominal cavity.; Thrombocytopenia: Due to microvascular damage, mainly intravascular damage and vasospasm, the consequences of serotonin and thromboxane A2 increase platelet aggregation in the vascular lumen.\nHELLP can be difficult to diagnose clinically because it is easily confused with other diseases in pregnancy such as: acute fatty liver of pregnancy, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, appendicitis, gallbladder disease, ejaculation. thrombocytopenia, lupus flare, antiphospholipid syndrome, hemolytic uremic syndrome, thrombocytopenic purpura.\nAccording to one study, of 46 women who developed liver disease during pregnancy that required treatment, 70% of cases had acute fatty liver disease and 15% had HELLP pregnancy syndrome. This syndrome is difficult to distinguish from acute fatty liver disease based only on clinical symptoms because both have quite similar clinical symptoms and appear at the same time during pregnancy. Therefore, the doctor may prescribe some additional paraclinical tests to strengthen the basis of diagnosis.",
