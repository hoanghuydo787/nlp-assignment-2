The disease appears from birth, but is often diagnosed late when the child is 14-16 years old when parents realize that the child does not have pubertal characteristics. (first)\nOther names for this syndrome: (2)\nHypogonadism and anemia; Idiopathic hypogonadism; Hypogonadism partial or complete loss of smell  (anosmia); Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and partial or complete loss of smell (anosmia); Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism- partial or complete loss of smell (anosmia); Olfactory syndrome\nWhat is Kallmann syndrome? This is a rare syndrome, occurring more in men than women, with a rate of 1/30,000 men and 1/120,000 women. Due to genetic characteristics, Kallmann syndrome appears right from birth. Male patients often have an abnormally small penis and unenlarged testicles. During puberty, most patients do not develop sexual characteristics such as: No beard, high-pitched voice (in men), no menstruation, no breast development (in women), no hair armpit pubic hair or pubic hair and scanty. If not treated early, the patient will become infertile and have psychological abnormalities due to not developing normally like their peers, accompanied by metabolic disorders due to decreased sex hormones.",
