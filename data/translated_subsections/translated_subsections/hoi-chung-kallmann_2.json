    "subsection_content": "In people with Kallmann syndrome, genetic mutations change the movement or function of certain nerve cells in the brain. Before your baby is born, olfactory neurons (which are responsible for smell) and neurons that produce gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) are formed as the nose is developing. GnRH is a hormone in the hypothalamus that stimulates the pituitary gland to produce gonadotropins. Gonadotropin is a gonadotropin hormone in the pituitary gland, which has an effect on reproductive organs such as testicles in men and ovaries in women to secrete sex hormones,...\nNormally, when the fetus matures, nerve cells begin to move from the nose to the brain, to the hypothalamus (responsible for secreting the hormone GnRH, regulating body temperature and breathing rate). However, due to certain genetic mutations, these neurons do not move properly during development in patients with Kallmann syndrome.\nAs a result, after birth, people with Kallmann syndrome show signs of impaired olfactory function and difficulty recognizing scents. This also means that the brain does not release GnRH at normal levels.\nWhen GnRH from the hypothalamus is impaired, the pituitary gland will not adequately secrete gonadotropins such as FSH and LH. FSH is a hormone that stimulates ovarian follicle development and sperm production. LH is a hormone that releases eggs and stimulates the ovaries and testicles to create sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone.\nIn normal people, these hormones promote the gonads to produce testosterone and estrogen, thereby promoting the development of secondary sexual characteristics (such as breast development, pubic hair, facial hair). As for people with Kallmann syndrome, they may need the intervention of hormone replacement therapy to promote the release of these hormones.",
