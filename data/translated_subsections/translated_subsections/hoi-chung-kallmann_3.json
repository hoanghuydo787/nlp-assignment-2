Inherited by X-linked sex chromosomes\nMen only need to receive an X chromosome carrying the mutated gene from their mother to manifest the disease. For females (people with two X chromosomes), two mutated genes are needed. This type of inheritance also means that the father cannot transmit the disease to his son (because the son only receives the Y chromosome from the father). An example of Kallmann syndrome inherited in this manner is a mutation in the ANOS1 gene.\n2. Autosomal dominant inheritance\nOnly one parent needs to carry the mutated gene to pass it on to their children and cause the disease. A child only needs to carry one mutated gene to develop the disease. Kallmann syndrome is caused by the following gene mutations and has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, including: FGFR1, PROKR2, PROK2, CHD7, FGF8.\n3. Autosomal recessive inheritance\nBoth parents (usually asymptomatic) can have a child with Kallmann syndrome. In this case, the child must carry 2 disease-causing genes received from father and mother. The mutated genes in this case are PROKR and PROK2.",
