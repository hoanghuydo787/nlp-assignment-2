Diagnosis of the disease is based on clinical examination, endocrine tests, imaging and genetic tests. (4)\nClinical signs: Symptoms and signs of delayed puberty or loss of smell. This feature helps distinguish Kallmann syndrome from most other forms of hypogonadism, which do not affect the sense of smell.\nBiochemical testing: Is an important part in diagnosing Kallmann syndrome. The GnRH hormone cannot be measured directly in the body. Instead, it tests blood levels of hormones such as LH, FSH and sex hormones such as testosterone, estrogen and progesterone. These hormones will be low in Kallmann syndrome\nAt the same time, coordinate with doctors from the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Center to examine the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and nose to find the cause of abnormalities in hormone secretion and loss of function. smell.\nFinally genetic tests may be performed to confirm the diagnosis of the disease.\nGenetic testing, a genetic mutation that affects the development of certain nerve cells in the brain is the cause of Kallmann syndrome. There are about 25 different genes related to this syndrome, but the most common are mutations in 6 genes ANOS1, CHD7, FGF8, FGFR1, PROK2 and PROKR2. These gene mutations account for about 50% of cases of Kallmann syndrome. The remaining cases may have unknown causes or be due to new mutations that have not yet been discovered.",
