According to Dr. Dung, the main goal of treating Kallmann syndrome is to stimulate puberty and restore the patient's fertility.\nHormone replacement therapy helps restore male fertility\nHormone replacement treatment for Kallmann syndrome may begin with replacement of sex hormones such as testosterone for men; estrogen and progesterone for women. Testosterone and estrogen/progesterone replacement therapy by themselves will not restore fertility. The goal of this treatment is to stimulate puberty and the development of secondary sexual characteristics. Sex hormone treatment also plays an important role in maintaining bone density, which can decline due to lack of sex hormones.\nHowever, using injection therapy with hormones such as FSH or LH, as well as synthetic forms of GnRH, can help restore fertility as well as stimulate the ovaries and testicles to synthesize sex hormones.\nSome studies show that 10% - 20% of people with congenital hypogonadism regain their ability to produce these hormones. However, this recovery may not last.\nEstimated statistics show that fertility can be achieved in 75% - 80% of male patients. Therapies such as pulsatile GnRH may also help stimulate ovulation in women. Or assisted reproductive therapy is also an option for people with Kallmann syndrome who want to conceive.",
