    "subsection_content": "With Klinefelter, the most common karyotype is 47, XXY (accounting for 90%). Mosaic chromosomes such as 46, XY/47, XXY, and other aneuploidies such as 48, XXXY, and 49, XXXXY have also been described. The appearance of an extra X chromosome is random and due to nondisjunction during meiosis or postzygotic nondisjunction. The severity of the phenotype will often correlate with the number of X chromosomes added.\nAccording to studies, the origin of abnormal chromosomes from the father accounts for about 53%, 34% is due to meiosis I disorder in the mother, 9% is due to meiosis II disorder in the mother and the remaining 3% is due to zygote cleavage disorder. . Advanced maternal age increases abnormalities in meiosis I. Having an extra X chromosome leads to hyalineization and fibrosis of the testicles, reduces spermatogenesis, causes genital abnormalities and infertility. An increase in the number of X chromosomes leads to an increase in intellectual disability and deformities.",
