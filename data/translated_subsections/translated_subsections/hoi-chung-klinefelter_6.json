Prenatal diagnosis can be performed using the NIPT method to identify sex chromosome abnormalities; the published positive predictive value of this method for Klinefelter syndrome is 67%. Other prenatal and postnatal tests are performed for confirmation in suspected cases.\nAfter birth, the disease is diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and confirmed diagnosis by cytogenetic analysis of chromosomes, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, and/or chromosome microarray analysis.",
