Early diagnosis of Klinefelter in utero allows scientists to assess neuropsychological development and provide early intervention measures.\nThe rate of delayed speech and motor skills is present in 50-70% of patients, so early intervention to address these problems is recommended. If the problem of delayed speech is not addressed, it leads to limited self-expression, contributing to behavioral problems.\nBesides, mobility problems such as myasthenia gravis, hyperactivity, flat feet, knees touching each other... affect motor development... so it is necessary to apply physical therapy and speech therapy. , neuropsychological testing to learn more about language, oral reading, and cognition.\nMen with Klinefelter syndrome often have early onset of hypogonadism, with some cases of hypogonadism starting during pregnancy.

The use of androgen replacement is individualized and can be initiated at puberty or delayed until the patient has clear evidence of hypogonadism.\nIn the field of assisted reproduction, the introduction of advanced microsurgical techniques such as sperm extraction from testicles with the micro-TESE method has successfully brought the opportunity to become fathers for more than half of men with the syndrome.
