TOS occurs when nerves or blood vessels are compressed by the ribs, collarbone, or neck muscles at the exit end. A collection of ill-defined disorders characterized by pain and paresthesias in the hands, neck, shoulders, or arms. They involve compression of the brachial plexus (and possibly the supraclavicular vessels) as these structures pass through the thoracic outlet. (first)",
