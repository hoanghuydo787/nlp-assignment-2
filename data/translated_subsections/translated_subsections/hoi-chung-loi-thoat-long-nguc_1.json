    "subsection_content": "TOS syndrome is classified into 3 types based on the pathophysiology of symptoms including:\nNeurogenic TOS (nTOS): This is the most common type, characterized by compression of the brachial plexus, which is a network of nerves that come from the spinal cord and control movements and movements. muscle sensation in your shoulders, arms, and hands.\nnTOS (neurological TOS) accounts for 90%, occurs when the nerves in the plexus area are compressed, causing pain and weakness in the shoulders and arms.\nVenous TOS (vTOS): Occurs when one or more veins (venous thoracic outlet syndrome) or arteries (thoracic arterial outlet syndrome) under the collarbone (collarbone) are compressed.; Arterial TOS (aTOS) is also known as disputed thoracic outlet syndrome. Some doctors don't think it exists, while others think it's a common disorder. People with aTOS have chronic pain in the thoracic outlet area that worsens with activity, but the specific cause of the pain cannot be identified.\nSometimes, venous TOS and arterial TOS are collectively referred to as vascular thoracic outlet syndrome.",
