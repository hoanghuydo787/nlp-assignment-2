    "subsection_content": "Common diagnostic measures will include:\nClinical examination combined with imaging diagnostic methods such as vascular Doppler ultrasound, neck-thoracic X-ray, to evaluate anatomical variations of the bones in the neck base area.; CT scan with contrast injection to evaluate abnormalities of the thoracic skeleton and detect arterial and venous abnormalities such as stenosis/occlusion, thrombosis, aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm, and evaluate collaterals.; MRI is useful in patients with neurological TOS, especially in evaluating the brachial plexus and surrounding structures. MRI can evaluate bone and soft tissue abnormalities; brachial plexus edema when arms are raised high. In addition, CT or MRI scans also provide additional anatomical details necessary for surgical planning.; For vascular TOS, vascular Doppler ultrasound is highly sensitive and specific, noninvasive, and inexpensive, making it the initial imaging test of choice.; For patients with cervical ribs, treatment is reserved for symptomatic patients, as the presence of cervical ribs exists in 0.5% of the population but only a small fraction develop symptoms.",
