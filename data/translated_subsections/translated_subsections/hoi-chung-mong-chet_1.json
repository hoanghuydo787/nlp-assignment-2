    "subsection_content": "The leading cause of Dead Butt Syndrome is that sitting for too long causes the flexors around the hips to tighten and shorten, so the glutes have to lengthen to compensate. The gluteal flexors are a group of muscles that originate from the lower back, to the pelvis and the front of the thighs. This muscle group is responsible for moving your legs when you walk, run, and climb stairs.\nIf the hip flexors are not stretched, brisk walking can also cause dead butt syndrome. Tightening of the hip muscles and lengthening of the glutes can also cause gluteal tendonitis. Furthermore, the gluteal muscles are naturally thin and small, and the supporting tendons are also susceptible to damage, so injuries can easily occur.\nOne surprise is that people who run a lot and do high-intensity exercises for the front and back thighs (like squats...) are also at higher risk of DBS. The reason this group of people works their thigh muscles too much and forgets their buttock muscles. In addition, jogging or exercising too hard for a long time and in the same position can also put stress on the muscles and tendons. Athletes and ballet dancers are also at higher risk than others.\nSitting for too long also limits blood circulation, causing the buttocks to suddenly become \"forgetful\", leading to hip pain, lower back pain and problems with the ankles.",
