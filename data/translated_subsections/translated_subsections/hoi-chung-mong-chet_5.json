Physical activity will stimulate blood circulation and revive \"memory\" for the buttocks.\nIn addition, doing some simple dead butt exercises is also a way to prevent you from becoming a \"member\" of Dead Butt Syndrome. This helps maintain strength and flexibility in the glutes, hip flexors, and hip joints.\nSquat wide jump position: Legs shoulder-width apart. Squat at a 90-degree angle to the surface. Use your glutes and glutes to jump as high as possible. Fall down gently and return to a squat position.; Leg exercises with straps: Wear the straps on the top of your ankles. Bend your knees and start walking sideways to the left for 10 steps and repeat the same to the right. This move will strengthen the gluteus medius and gluteus medius while also activating the gluteus maximus.; Side lunge: This is a lower-body exercise that strengthens the glutes, glutes, and hamstrings while also working the inner and outer thighs. Stand with your feet together, then step as wide as possible to the left while bending your knees to a 90-degree angle. Keep your right leg straight. Repeat the same on the other leg.; Squats: You can do them with or without weights. Legs spread shoulder-width apart. Tighten your muscles and slowly bend your knees so that your thighs are almost parallel to the ground. Slowly return to the starting position. Perform 12 – 15 times. Repeat 3-4 times/week.; Leg raises: Exercise for the core and hip flexors. You lie on a firm, but comfortable surface. Keeping your legs straight, slowly raise them high enough, holding a bit as your legs rise. Then you will feel like your muscles are flexible.\nTO SCHEDULE AN EXAMINATION APPOINTMENT AND FIND INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT TAM ANH GENERAL HOSPITAL SYSTEM - Hanoi 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Bo De Ward, Long Bien District, Hanoi City Hotline: 024 3872 3872 – 024 7106 6858 – Ho Chi Minh City 2B Pho Quang, Ward 2, Tan Binh District, City.
