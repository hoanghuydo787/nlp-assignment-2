    "subsection_content": "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome in English) is the most common medical condition that compresses the peripheral nerves. This syndrome occurs when the median nerve is compressed as it passes through the carpal tunnel. The consequence of compression is inflammation, pain, numbness, reduced or loss of sensation in the skin of the hand under the influence of the median nerve, making the patient  uncomfortable.\nCurrently, the number of people with this syndrome is increasing due to the increasing demands of work that requires a lot of flexibility, meticulousness, and repetitive use of the wrist. In Vietnam, there are currently no official statistics on the incidence of this syndrome. Statistics in the US show that every year about 50/1000 people suffer from wrist disease, in high-risk groups this rate can be up to 500/1000. (first)",
