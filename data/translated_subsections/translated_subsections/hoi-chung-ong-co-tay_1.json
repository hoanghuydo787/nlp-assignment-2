    "subsection_content": "Carpal tunnel inflammation when using a computer mouse is very common\nSubjects susceptible to carpal tunnel disease are middle-aged women, mostly due to idiopathic causes (accounting for 70%), the rest may be due to endogenous or exogenous causes. (2)\n1. Idiopathic causes\nAbout 70% of patients with the disease have no clear cause found. There may be synovitis, increased pressure in the intercellular space in the carpal tunnel, causing compression of the median nerve. In fact, symptoms have been shown to decrease with oral anti-inflammatory drugs or injections into the carpal tunnel.\n2. Exogenous causes\nJoint deformities and injuries to the wrist: Fracture of the lower radius, fracture of the wrist, pseudoscaphoid joint, subluxation of the scaphoid, dislocation of the lunate bone, arthritis of the wrist causing compression of the median nerve in the cervical canal hand; Hemophilia, myeloma; Types of tumors: Giant cell tumors of bone and tendon sheaths, hemangiomas, synovial cysts, tophy granulomas... causing displacement of the carpal tunnel and leading to compression of the median nerve\n3. Endogenous causes\nFluid retention during pregnancy: During pregnancy, fluid retention increases the amount of fluid in the carpal tunnel, leading to increased interstitial pressure in the carpal tunnel, causing compression of the median nerve.; Gout: Due to the deposition of urate crystals in the flexor tendon causing tendon hypertrophy, or inflammation and hypertrophy of the flexor tendon sheath due to gout also causing compression of the median nerve.; Hypothyroidism: Caused by the accumulation of Myxedemateous tissue in the transverse carpal ligament; Rheumatoid arthritis: Causes inflammation of the tendon sheath/synovium leading to edema and fluid retention in the flexor tendon sheath.; Periodic hemodialysis: Peripheral neuropathy is common in patients with chronic kidney failure and is related to increased blood urea.",
