    "subsection_content": "Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (inflammation, pain, stenosis...) are quite diverse because the median nerve is a mixed nerve: sensory, motor and autonomic. Besides, because the median nerve comes from the cervical spinal nerve roots, sometimes the symptoms can be mixed or compressed together, leading to a condition of \"double compression\".\nUnderstanding clinical symptoms plays a very important role in coordinating with neuroimaging and electrophysiological investigations as a basis for diagnosis and treatment. The disease can cause the following signs:\n1. Sensory disorders\nPatients often have a feeling of numbness in the limbs, paresthesias, sharp pain from needles or burning in the skin area dominated by the median nerve (thumb, index finger, middle finger and half of the ring finger). These symptoms manifest from the wrist to the fingers. Sensory symptoms often increase at night, making the patient wake up and causing insomnia. Movements that bend or tilt the wrist too much or put pressure on the carpal tunnel area, such as riding a motorbike, also increase the feeling of numbness. Symptoms decrease when stopping movement, resting, and waving the hand.\n2. Movement disorders\nThis symptom appears in the late stages of the disease due to movement disorders in the median nerve. Some common symptoms include difficulty grasping, reduced hand dexterity, or dropping objects.",
