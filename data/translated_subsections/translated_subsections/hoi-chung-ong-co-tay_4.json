    "subsection_content": "To accurately diagnose whether a patient has the disease or not, the doctor will coordinate clinical and neuroelectrophysiological testing. Diagnosis of the disease is based on criteria including:\nHave at least one of the following physical symptoms including: carpal bone pain; hand paresthesia; numbness of the hands; decreased or lost sensation in the dominant median nerve area; Weakness in the neck and hands, which may occur during the day, at night, or continuously throughout the day.; There is at least one physical symptom including a positive Phalen, Tinel, Durkan test. Phalen test: Have the patient bend their wrists 90 degrees together for at least 60 seconds. The reverse Phalen test is replaced by stretching the wrists. The test is positive if the patient develops or increases sensory symptoms belonging to the median nerve in the hand. (3) Tinel test: Tap on the carpal tunnel area (you can use your hand or a reflex hammer), a positive test when tapping will cause a feeling of numbness or pain along the skin area distributed by the median nerve in the hand. . Durkan test: The examiner directly increases the pressure on the patient's wrist by using the thumb to press on the middle of the wrist crease. The test is considered positive when the patient feels numbness and pain increases along the nerve distribution when pressing and holding for more than 30 seconds.; Phalen test: Have the patient bend their wrists 90 degrees together for at least 60 seconds. The reverse Phalen test is replaced by stretching the wrists. The test is positive if the patient develops or increases sensory symptoms belonging to the median nerve in the hand. (3); Tinel test: Tap on the carpal tunnel area (you can use your hand or a reflex hammer), a positive test when tapping will cause a feeling of numbness or pain along the skin area dominated by the median nerve in the hand.; Durkan test: The examiner directly increases pressure on the patient's wrist by using the thumb to press on the position between the wrist crease. The test is considered positive when the patient feels numbness and pain increases along the nerve distribution when pressing and holding for more than 30 seconds.; At least 1 of the 2 motor and sensory potential signal indices of the median nerve and ulnar nerve is higher than the normal index.",
