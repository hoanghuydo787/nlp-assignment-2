Treatment methods include:\nMedical treatment: Indicated in the early stages of clinical carpal tunnel syndrome. Your doctor may prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or oral corticosteroids; At the same time, limit movements that cause excessive wrist flexion or pronation to reduce pressure in the carpal tunnel.; Using a wrist splint: This method can be done at night or continuously all day. Studies show that using a wrist brace can improve symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment.\nSurgical treatment: Applicable to patients in the severe stage, showing signs of sensory disorders, muscle atrophy, or who have had medical treatment for many months without improvement. Previously, classic open surgery with a longitudinal palmar incision or a small, minimally invasive open surgery were commonly used techniques. However, currently laparoscopic surgery is a more widely used treatment method. In particular, at the Center for Joint Surgery and Sports Medicine, Tam Anh General Hospital is applying the 1-hole endoscopic technique (1 entrance port) with a small incision of less than 1cm, bringing outstanding advantages: less invasive. , few complications, minimized risk of infection, guaranteed aesthetic factors, faster recovery time, patients can go home immediately after surgery.",
