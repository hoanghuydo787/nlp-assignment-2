    "subsection_content": "The cause of irritable bowel syndrome has not been clearly determined. However, experts point out that emotional factors, diet and medications have a direct impact on symptoms of digestive diseases.\nIt can be said that irritable bowel syndrome is a disease caused by a combination of physiological and psychosocial factors. These agents also stimulate the disease to relapse or become more severe.(3)\n1. Stress\nStress is a common cause of digestive diseases including irritable bowel syndrome. When a person is stressed, the central nervous system will use the autonomic nervous system to reduce stomach and intestinal function. Therefore, stress is considered a cause that increases your risk of irritable bowel syndrome.\n2. Hormones\nHormonal disorders are the cause of irritable bowel syndrome and are related to abnormal hormone changes. Hormones are the cause of the group of psychosocial factors, creating opportunities for patients to easily develop irritable bowel syndrome. Hormones are a collection of hormone-producing glands in humans, with the function of balancing metabolism, maintaining and developing sexual, reproductive, and tissue functions.\nHormonal disorders cause abnormal changes in hormones, thereby causing digestive system dysfunction, increasing the likelihood of changes in intestinal motility leading to irritable bowel syndrome.\n3. Food\nFood is considered the main cause of irritable bowel syndrome. Food that is spoiled or not suitable for the patient's body will irritate the stomach and large intestine. These stimuli will cause increased intestinal motility, causing irritable bowel syndrome.\n4. Family history of the disease\nA family history of digestive diseases is also a factor that increases the risk of intestinal sensitivity, making you more susceptible to irritable bowel syndrome than others.\nThis factor is not the direct cause of IBS, but if you have a family member with a history of irritable bowel syndrome, you need to be aware of protecting the health of your digestive system.",
