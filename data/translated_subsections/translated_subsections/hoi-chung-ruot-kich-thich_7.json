    "subsection_content": "Irritable bowel syndrome is not a dangerous disease. IBS cases are often detected at a mild level, patients have symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain and defecation disorders, in addition, there are very rare cases of serious physical effects.\nIn some mild cases, the disease can go away on its own without needing medical treatment, just adjusting the diet. Therefore, when you suspect you have irritable bowel syndrome or are diagnosed with the disease, you should not stress or worry because this will make your symptoms worse.\nHowever, patients should not be subjective and seriously treat the disease so as not to aggravate and prolong the symptoms, affecting other organs in the digestive system. Patients also need to be examined and consulted by a doctor to rule out dangerous physical diseases in the digestive tract, before being assured that it is irritable bowel syndrome - a benign disease.",
