The skin around the eyes, genitals and mouth are also affected. If unfortunately this condition occurs, in severe cases, the patient may have to be hospitalized for treatment. (first)\nMany people believe that SJS and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are two diseases, but others consider them to be one disease but with different levels of severity. Stevens Johnson syndrome causes less severe manifestations than TEN. For example, skin peeling in people with SJS can affect less than 10% of the body, while in people with TEN, the extent of the impact is up to more than 30% of the body. However, both of these conditions are potentially life-threatening.\nOther names for this syndrome include:\nLyell's syndrome; Stevens-Johnson/ toxic epidermal necrolysis; Stevens-Johnson spectrum toxic epidermal necrolysis; Stevens-Johnson due to medication; Stevens-Johnson caused by mycoplasma (if related to a specific cause)",
