    "subsection_content": "Risk factors for developing Stevens-Johnson syndrome may come from a combination of factors including environmental and genetics. While environmental factors can cause genes to be activated, the genetic cause comes from specific human leukocyte antigens (HLA), increasing a person's risk of developing SJS or TEN.\nMedicines are the main cause of this condition.\nIn addition, allergic reactions to drugs are a common cause of this syndrome. All drugs have the risk of causing allergies to varying degrees. Some drugs with a \"high\" risk of causing illness are: (2)\nAllopurinol; Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; Sulfonamide antibiotics; Aminopenicillin; Cephalosporin; Quinolone; Carbamazepine; Phenytoin; Phenobarbital and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) belong to the Oxicam family.\nOther less common causes include: viral infections (Herpes virus, HIV, hepatitis A), bacterial infections (encephalitis, meningitis, dental infections, pneumonia), parasitic diseases , immune diseases (lupus erythematosus...), endocrine disorders during pregnancy/menstrual disorders...\nThe duration of an allergic reaction also depends on the drug and the patient's reaction. Allergic reactions can occur immediately after taking the medicine, about 30 - 60 minutes, or after 3 - 14 days.",
