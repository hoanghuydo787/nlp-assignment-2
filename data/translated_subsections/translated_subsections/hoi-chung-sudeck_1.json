    "subsection_content": "Mechanism of dystrophic pain syndrome: When there are frequent, chronic painful stimuli from the peripheral area, sympathetic nerve reflexes in the spinal cord area are likely to be disturbed. Because this sympathetic nerve area is disturbed, it causes sympathetic disorders in the peripheral area.\nSudeck syndrome often occurs after a triggering cause. Common causes include:\nShoulder, hand, neck injuries; diseases of the shoulder joint; cervical spine degeneration; Knee injury or after arthroscopic knee surgery; After performing surgery.; Carpal tunnel syndrome, myocardial infarction, stroke and breast cancer; Are using tuberculosis treatment drugs and barbiturates.\nWhen a fracture of the lower end of the radius or a fracture of the lower 1/3 of the forearm is not treated and anatomically perfectly adjusted, the patient is likely to have a misaligned cal. The misaligned cal position causes compression of the neurovascular bundle in the wrist, stimulating chronic pain. This is the trigger for Sudeck syndrome.",
