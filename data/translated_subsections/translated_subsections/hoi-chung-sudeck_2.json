    "subsection_content": "The skin at the injury site will become smoother and lose wrinkles. When moving, the patient feels pain. The pain is not specific to a specific part but spreads almost throughout the injured limb. At that time, the joints are limited in movement. Due to movement, the limb will become swollen, hot, and red even though there are no signs of infection.\nThe pain appears continuously. This is considered a complication of a fracture or injury. However, the time this condition appeared was relatively late. Sudeck syndrome often occurs in a number of locations including the hands, fingers, feet and ankles, and shoulder area. Some other symptoms patients may face include:\nChanges in skin color: Sometimes dark red, sometimes pale or purple; Skin temperature is sometimes hotter and sometimes colder than the opposite side; Sweating is more than normal in the early stages, then it dries up again.; In the late stages, the body experiences problems such as muscle atrophy, dry rough nails, and brittle cracks; Hair grows strongly at first and then falls out.\nUpper limb dystrophic pain syndrome\nThis condition starts slowly and gradually increases. Some cases may have a sudden and rapid onset. Shoulder-hand syndrome goes through 2 stages:\nProlonged swelling phase: This phase lasts from several weeks to several months. The hand and part of the forearm hurt a lot and had many obstacles when moving. Swelling appears in the hand and part of the forearm. The skin is shiny, pinkish red, gradually turning purple, slightly wet, and hot to the touch. Joints and muscles are stiff and difficult to move. Shoulder pain, limited range of motion from mild to severe. The shoulder is completely immobilized; Atrophy phase: Pain gradually decreases, swelling decreases but atrophy gradually. The hands are atrophied, the skin is thin, smooth, purple in color, the hair falls out, the fingers curl up and are difficult to stretch, the wrists bend, and the hands are severely stiff. The shoulder is almost motionless, frozen but not painful. The above damage is likely to be permanent and irreversible.\nLower limb dystrophic pain syndrome\nAfter the trigger, the patient feels pain in his legs. The pain gradually increases, causing the patient to have to use a cane to move. The foot can be simply painful, or the entire foot can be paralyzed. X-ray results showed scattered osteoporosis.\nIn addition, patients may experience leg pain and swelling. The leg is paralyzed and cannot move, the whole foot is swollen, red and hot like inflammation, range of motion is limited due to pain and swelling. X-ray results showed total osteoporosis.\nAt the knee joint, there are many types of damage including severe swelling that is easily confused with knee arthritis, knee effusion, leg muscle atrophy, knee stiffness, thigh and leg muscle atrophy, and mild pain. At the hip joint, the patient feels pain, limited range of motion, and thigh muscle atrophy. X-ray results showed bone thinning and gradually increasing osteoporosis in the hip joint.\nDystrophic pain in the legs will be well controlled when treated promptly and properly, rarely leaving sequelae. The average time from the onset of the disease to good control of the disease condition for the foot is 12 months, 7 months for the knee joint and 5 months for the hip joint.",
