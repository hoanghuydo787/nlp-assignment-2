The doctor will rely on clinical signs and some imaging test results to determine the correct condition and provide appropriate treatment. Clinical signs include:\nPain at many different levels: Patients feel pain ranging from tingling to burning or electric shock.; The pain gradually increases, with episodes of intense pain like a burn, changing with the weather and emotions. If the patient passively or actively moves the joints, the pain will increase.; Initial loss of function leads to stiffness due to fibrosis in the joint.; The affected area is initially edematous and then gradually has muscle atrophy, with fibrous adhesion at the joints.; There are signs of vascular disorders.\nThere is no specific test to diagnose the condition. Doctors may prescribe patients:\nMRI scan: Scan results help doctors observe and identify abnormalities inside the body, especially changes in tissues; X-ray: The results of the scan help doctors determine mineral loss in the bones. X-rays are often indicated in the later stages of the disease.; Sweat test: The doctor will check to see if one side of the body sweats more than the other; Temperature check: The doctor will check the temperature or blood flow at the site of injury compared to other locations in the body.",
