    "subsection_content": "1. Primary immunodeficiency disease\nMany people are born with some immune defense system missing or an ineffective immune system that makes them susceptible to infection. This is primary immunodeficiency. (2)\nPatients with basic symptoms such as infections last longer and are more difficult to treat than some people with normal immune systems. They can also get infections that normal people don't get (opportunistic infections). However, signs and symptoms also vary depending on the type of immunodeficiency disorder and each person's constitution.\n2. Secondary immunodeficiency disease\nSecondary immunodeficiency is formed during development, symptoms are often easier to detect... There are many causes of secondary immunity including:\nChronic diseases (diabetes, kidney failure, cancer, etc.): chronic diseases cause the body to ineffectively synthesize nutrients that participate in the metabolic process to create antibodies against microorganisms. foreign bacteria. At the same time, chemotherapy and radiotherapy for cancer using corticosteroid drugs cause side effects that weaken the immune system.; In patients with injuries requiring spleen removal, the risk of infection is higher.; Drug addiction, HIV infection: lymphocytes are destroyed, reducing immunity, causing the body to increase the risk of infection, which can initially cause fever, then gradually worsen with damage to the brain and nervous system. genital, kidney, heart, cognitive impairment, etc. HIV infection can be diagnosed with antibody or antigen tests.; Staying in the hospital for a long time: physical inactivity, loss of appetite, worries about illness, hospital bills... are common problems when staying in the hospital for a long time. The combination of health problems and psychological fatigue causes cells to gradually become ineffective, leading to a weakened immune system.; Organ transplantation: in the postoperative period, immunosuppressive drugs play a key role in the success of organ transplantation. However, they inhibit all immune responses and contribute to post-transplant complications including: cancer cell growth, increased risk of cardiovascular disease and even death from uncontrolled infections. controllable.\nChronic disease is one of the causes of a weakened immune system\nMalnutrition: nutrition plays an important role for a healthy body. A long-term diet lacking nutrients, especially protein, can weaken the body's immune system.\nIn addition, aging cells over time lead to organ failure and synthesis of nutrients that do not meet the body's needs, making people susceptible to immunodeficiency. Especially in the elderly, the immune tissue system (such as the pituitary gland) shrinks, the number and white blood cells decrease, so the immune system is no longer effective, making it difficult to protect the body from pathogens. harmful.\n3. Common variegated immunodeficiency (CVID)\nIt is a basic immune system disorder, due to defects in a number of different but often unclear components, including humoral immunity. People with CVID have signs similar to agammaglobulinemia linked to genetic mutations on the X chromosome in developing infections, but onset tends to be later (usually between 20 and 40 years of age). (3)\n4. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)\nA primary disorder involving a combined deficiency of humoral and cellular immunity due to mutations in any one of many different genes. Most of these defects are autosomal recessive.\nMost children from birth to 6 years of age with combined immunodeficiency often have candida, persistent viral infections, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and diarrhea that slow growth. In addition, children may have exfoliative dermatitis, bone abnormalities, etc. If not detected early, SCID will cause death for the child.\n5. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD)\nThis is a primary immunodeficiency disorder associated with phagocytic cell defects. More than 50% of CGD cases occur in men due to X-linked recessive inheritance. In CGD, leukocytes do not produce hydrogen peroxide, superoxide and O2 complex activators because of the lack of NDAPH activity. oxidase causes the bactericidal function of phagocytic cells to fail. Therefore, bacteria and fungi do not die despite normal phagocytosis.\nChronic granulomatous disease often begins with recurrent abscesses during childhood. Many granulomatous lesions occur in the lungs, liver, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, and urinary tract. In addition, it also causes other problems such as pneumonia, lymphadenitis, anal abscess, stomatitis, and osteomyelitis.\nA weakened immune system makes you susceptible to bacterial and viral infections",
