    "subsection_content": "The body's immune system includes the following organs: spleen, tonsils, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. Proteins and blood cells are also part of the immune system, helping to protect the body from harmful agents. When detecting an attacking agent, the body will produce antibodies to destroy the pathogens. During this process, some white blood cells engulf and destroy bacteria and other foreign materials. Additional proteins also support this process.\nWhen the immune system is weakened, white blood cells and especially T and B lymphocytes function abnormally, the body does not produce enough antibodies, causing harmful agents such as cancer cells, bacteria, Viruses and parasites attack strongly, causing the body to gradually weaken.",
