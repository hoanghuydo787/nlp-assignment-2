    "subsection_content": "When you notice that you are susceptible to illness and require prolonged treatment, you should go to a reputable medical facility to check whether you have immunodeficiency syndrome or not. The doctor will ask about your medical history, perform a physical exam, determine the number of white blood cells, T cells and immune levels to make an accurate diagnosis. If a T-cell abnormality is suspected, doctors may perform a skin test. Through this, small amounts of proteins from common infectious organisms (yeast) are injected just under the skin. If there is no reaction (swelling or redness) within 2 days, this may be a sign of disease caused by T cell abnormalities.\nYour doctor may also perform blood tests to determine your risk of genetic mutations that cause immunodeficiency disorders.",
