    "subsection_content": "Amenorrhea since childhood, no menstruation at all since entering puberty, however by the age of 20, Ms. D.T.Q. (42 years old, Hanoi City) just went to the doctor and was diagnosed with anti-androgen syndrome at the age of 20 (1997), but has not been treated. About 2 years ago, Ms. Q. started a course of treatment with Marvelon, then had her period but it only lasted about 3 days. The endocrinologist and obstetrician diagnosed her with Swyer syndrome and prescribed surgery to remove both ovaries and fallopian tubes.\nThe patient was admitted to Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi in a state of consciousness and good communication; pink skin and mucous membranes; no edema, no subcutaneous bleeding; Thyroid gland is not enlarged, peripheral lymph nodes are not palpable; Abdomen is soft, no unusual lumps.\nThrough genital and urinary examination, it was discovered that the external genitals had a vulva, vagina, and long, sparse pubic hair. Paraclinically, chromosome testing: 46,XY. Test to detect the sex chromosome gene containing the testicular differentiation gene (TDF): SRY; At the same time, genes on the Y sex chromosome were detected: ZFY, AZFa, AZFb, AZFc, AZFd.\nAbdominal CT image noted right kidney cyst; The uterus and ovaries on both sides were atrophied. Other clinical tests were all within normal limits. The patient was scheduled for surgery under endotracheal anesthesia at 8:30 p.m. on July 12, 2019 with a preoperative diagnosis: Anti-Androgen Syndrome/Swyer Syndrome.\nThe surgery took place in a sterile operating room at Tam Anh General Hospital. The doctors discovered that the large omentum was sticking to the old appendicitis incision, and Douglas had some thin red-brown fluid. The uterus is small in size, the fallopian tubes are normal on both sides, and the 2 ovaries are atrophied close to the fallopian tubes. The ureters on both sides were not dilated and there was no mass. The biliary tract and gallbladder are not dilated. The stomach, pancreas, spleen, duodenum, colon, rectum, and small intestine were tumor-free and had no abnormalities. The appendix has been removed. The peritoneum is smooth. Surgical diagnosis: Complete anti-Androgen syndrome/Swyer syndrome/appendectomy.\n“Our treatment method is to remove the patient's old post-operative adhesions, cut the ovaries and fallopian tubes on both sides, carefully stop the bleeding, and install drainage. The patient's entire greater omentum was removed from the old incision to remove the appendix, the ovaries and fallopian tubes were removed on both sides with a Ligasure knife, specimens were taken through the umbilical trocar and sent for pathology, and a Douglas drain was placed. . The post-operative pathology of the ovarian tissue is the fibrotic fallopian tube and ovary tissue with Mullerian duct remnants\", People's Artist, Professor, Dr. Trinh Hong Son - In charge of Gastroenterology surgery department - General Hospital. Tam Anh, Hanoi said.\nAfter surgery, the patient progressed well. 6 hours after surgery, the patient could eat, her stomach was soft, no bloating, and no vomiting. On the second day after surgery, the patient had abdominal drainage removed. The following days, the patient progressed well and stabilized. 3 days later, the patient was discharged from the hospital.",
