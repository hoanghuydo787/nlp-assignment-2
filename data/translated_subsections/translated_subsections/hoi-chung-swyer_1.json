In 1955, author Swyer reported 2 female cases with unusual phenotypic manifestations and genotype 46,XY. Since then, this syndrome was named after the author with an incidence of about 1/80,000 births. (first)\nSexual development disorders are divided into 3 groups: 46,XX; 46,XY; and sex chromosome disorders. The 46,XY group can be divided into disorders of gonadal (testicular) development or disorders of androgen synthesis. Gonadal developmental disorders are divided into complete developmental disorders (Swyer syndrome), partial developmental disorders, gonadal degeneration, and testicular-ovarian developmental disorders.",
