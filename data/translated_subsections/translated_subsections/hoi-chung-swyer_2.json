    "subsection_content": "Normally, the development of testicles or ovaries from primitive gonads is governed by a molecular network specific to male and female sex, so the diagnosis of sexual development disorders must be based on on clinical findings, hormonal analysis, gonadal histology, chromosome analysis and genetic testing.\nDuring normal development, sex expression determines the Y region gene on the Y chromosome that initiates a genetic lineage that causes the primitive gonad to develop as a testis. In the developing testis secretion of anti-Mullerian hormone from sertoli cells causes degeneration of the mullerian duct. Testosterone secreted from Leydig cells promotes the differentiation of Wolffian ducts, vas deferens, and epididymis. In the absence of the Y chromosome, the testes do not develop and the Mullerian ducts survive to form the fallopian tubes, uterus, and upper vagina. If this developmental pathway is faulty, causing loss of gene function, the result will be sexual development disorders.\nTo date, a number of disease-causing genes have been identified in 46,XY sex development disorder syndrome such as: ARX, ATRX, CBX2, DHH, DMRT1, GATA4, MAMLD1, MAP3K1, NR0B1, NR5A1, SOX9, SRY , WNT4, WT1 and WWOX.\nIn 1990, a mutation in the Y chromosome testicular formation factor (SRY) gene was identified in a woman with 46,XY disorder of sexual development. In a subsequent study, it was shown that 10-20% of women with Swyer syndrome had a deletion in the DNA binding region of the SRY gene. In the remaining 80-90% of women, the SRY gene is normal and is associated with mutations in other testicular determinants.\nThe SOX9 gene is known as a core sex-determining gene across all vertebrates. In humans, mutations in the SOX9 gene cause campomelic dysplasia, characterized by skeletal malformations and 46,XY gender dysmorphia. The regulation of SOX9 expression in the gonads is tightly controlled, and the earliest development of sex determination was the activation of the SOX9 gene by transcription of SRY. SRY and SF-1 cooperate to activate the testicular differentiation of the respective SOX9 (hTES). This process depends on the phosphorylation of SF-1 factor. SOX9 also activates hTES, enhanced by SF1, which maintains SOX9 expression by an autoregulatory mechanism.",
