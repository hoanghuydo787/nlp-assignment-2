    "subsection_content": "People with Swyer syndrome are women with a typical female genital phenotype from birth, with a normal Mullerian duct structure, but the gonads have no hormonal ability, leading to infertility. Menstruation and delayed puberty. Prenatal screening when the family has factors such as having a sibling with this condition helps to diagnose Swyer syndrome early, but only 4% have family factors. Experts recommend specialized examination for girls with amenorrhea or puberty at age 14. However, this examination can affect the patient's psychology, so it is necessary to examine carefully. and under the advice of a specialist, a psychologist may be necessary.\nThe characteristic clinical feature of patients with this syndrome is a differential increase in adult height. In the study by Ogata et al., the average height of women with Swyer syndrome was 173cm compared with the average height of British women of 161cm. This increase in stature may be due to the influence of the Y chromosome in the genotype of women with Swyer syndrome or to a delay in the completion of the epiphysis of long bones due to lack of sex hormones.
