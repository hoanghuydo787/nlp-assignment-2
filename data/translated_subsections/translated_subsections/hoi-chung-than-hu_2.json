    "subsection_content": "The cause of nephrotic syndrome is inflammation and damage to the glomerular filtration membrane. The function of the glomerular filtration membrane is to filter blood in the body as it passes through the kidneys. Healthy glomeruli keep proteins in the blood (albumin) from passing through the filter membrane.\nWhen the glomerular filtration membrane becomes inflamed, too much protein in the blood will seep through the membrane, leading to nephrotic syndrome. Most cases of nephrotic syndrome in young people have no cause (primary nephrotic syndrome).",
