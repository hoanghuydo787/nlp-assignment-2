    "subsection_content": "Complications of nephrotic syndrome can be dangerous such as:\nHigh blood cholesterol and blood triglycerides: Reduced levels of albumin protein in the blood cause the liver to produce more albumin. At the same time, the liver releases more cholesterol and triglycerides; Malnutrition: When the body loses too much protein in the blood, it can become malnourished. This condition causes severe weight loss that is difficult to notice because the body is swollen. In addition, the body may also have a decrease in the number of red blood cells (anemia), vitamin D and calcium.; High blood pressure: A patient's blood pressure can increase due to excess salt and water retention in the body; Acute kidney failure: When the kidneys lose the ability to filter blood due to glomerular damage, waste can quickly accumulate in the blood. At that time, the patient may need urgent dialysis.; Chronic kidney disease: Nephrotic syndrome, when not treated promptly and the condition persists for a long time, can lead to chronic kidney function deterioration. When kidney function is greatly reduced, the patient may need hemodialysis or a kidney transplant.; Infection: People with nephrotic syndrome are at high risk of infection; Increases blood clotting, leading to the formation of venous thrombosis in the legs or elsewhere.\nNephrotic syndrome can cause high blood pressure",
