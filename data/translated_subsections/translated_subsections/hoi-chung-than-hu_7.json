Criteria for diagnosing nephrotic syndrome\nPhew.; Increased proteinuria of more than 3.5g in 24 hours; Reduced blood protein below 60g/liter, accompanied by decreased blood albumin below 30g/liter.; Blood cholesterol increased from 6.5mmol/liter or more; Appearance of birefringent fat granules and fat pillars in urine\nCriteria 2 and 3 are mandatory in diagnosing nephrotic syndrome. The remaining standards may not be complete.\n2. Clinical diagnosis\nSimple nephrotic syndrome: When fully determining the diagnostic criteria for nephrotic syndrome, there are no symptoms of hypertension, hematuria or kidney failure.; Nephrotic syndrome is not simple: In addition to the diagnostic criteria for nephrotic syndrome, there is also the presence of hypertension, gross or microscopic hematuria, or accompanied by kidney failure.\n3. Diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome according to cause\nCauses of primary nephrotic syndrome include:\nMinimal change glomerulopathy; Membranous glomerulonephritis: In some developing countries, membranous glomerulonephritis is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults; Focal sclerosing glomerulonephritis; Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; Mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis; Extravascular proliferative glomerulonephritis\nSecondary causes of nephrotic syndrome include drugs, toxins, autoimmune diseases, malignant diseases, genetic diseases, metabolic disorders, infections and parasites...\n4. Diagnosis through histopathology\nMinimal change glomerulopathy; Membranous glomerulonephritis; Focal sclerosing glomerulonephritis; Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; Mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis; Extravascular proliferative glomerulonephritis.\n5. Complications\nPeople with nephrotic syndrome may have complications such as:\nInfection: Acute or chronic infection occurs, most commonly cellulitis and peritonitis.; Embolism (thrombosis): Includes acute or chronic renal vein occlusion, limb vein and artery occlusion, iliac arteriovenous and splenic vein occlusion or, more rarely, pulmonary embolism.; Acute kidney failure.; Electrolyte disorders; Malnutrition; Complications due to medication use: Usually due to long-term use of corticosteroid drugs, or due to use of other immunosuppressants or diuretics.; Chronic renal failure.\nIf treatment is delayed, nephrotic syndrome can cause chronic kidney failure",
