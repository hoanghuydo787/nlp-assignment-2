    "subsection_content": "1. Treatment of secondary nephrotic syndrome:\nTreatment depends on the cause of nephrotic syndrome\n2. Specific treatment of primary nephrotic syndrome\nSpecific treatment is the use of corticosteroid therapy. During the first outbreak, in the attack phase, use prednisolone (corticoid group) for at least 4 weeks. If the patient responds well to treatment (24-hour urine test does not show proteinuria, or if it remains, it is only in trace form), the prednisolone dose will be gradually reduced.; However, patients need to continue taking prednisolone annually as prescribed by their doctor. If the patient does not respond to prednisolone, the doctor will instruct the patient to undergo a kidney biopsy, based on histopathology results to determine the next treatment direction.; In the treatment of relapses, for rare relapses (less than 1 time in 6 months), the doctor will apply the same treatment as the first phase. For frequent relapses (2 or more relapses in 6 months) or corticosteroid dependence, the doctor will use an attack dose similar to the first phase until the proteinuria stops. The patient must then use a prolonged maintenance dose, gradually reducing the dose until one year later.; Immunosuppressive drugs are used in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome or relapse, dependence, drug resistance or the appearance of serious side effects when using corticosteroids.\n3. Treat symptoms\nIn the early stages, patients with nephrotic syndrome do not respond to treatment, and symptomatic treatment measures may then be necessary. These are the only treatments for nephrotic syndrome for cases with persistent symptoms that do not respond to any specific treatment. Symptomatic treatment options for this condition include:\nReduce edema: In the stage of severe edema, patients need to eat absolutely bland food. During the mild edema stage, you only need to eat relatively light meals. On average every day, a normal person eats about 4 - 6g of sodium, equivalent to 15g of salt (3 teaspoons). Eating relatively bland means consuming about 5g of salt per day, including in fish sauce and MSG. Because they also contain a certain amount of salt.; Use diuretics as prescribed by your doctor; Reduce protein in the diet:; In addition, plasma and albumin infusion is also needed (albumin infusion is performed when the blood albumin test is below 10g/l).; Lowering blood pressure: Measures to reduce average blood pressure or at least reduce systolic blood pressure help protect the kidneys. The group of antihypertensive drugs often prescribed by doctors are ACE inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor inhibitors. Sometimes without hypertension, these two groups of drugs can still be used due to their effect in reducing proteinuria.; When there is an infection, use antibiotics; Other drugs include inhibition of gastric acid secretion, calcium, vitamin D2, trace elements... to limit side effects of corticosteroids and consequences from proteinuria.",
