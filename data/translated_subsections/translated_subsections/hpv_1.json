    "subsection_content": "Scientists have identified more than 100 different strains of HPV virus. Most of them are harmless, have no symptoms, and go away without treatment.\nThere are more than 40 strains of HPV virus that can cause genital and anal infections. Of these, 15 high-risk HPV strains are capable of causing various cancers, from cervical, anal to other genital cancers. Less dangerous strains can cause warts on the hands, feet (especially the soles), genital warts, etc. Some common HPV strains include:\nHPV 6 and HPV 11\nThese are low-risk HPV strains. They are involved in about 90% of genital warts. HPV 11 can also cause changes to the cervix.\nHPV vaccination is an effective way to prevent HPV 6 and HPV 11. Studies show the vaccine is 89-99% effective against HPV 6 and HPV 11 in people aged 9-26 years.\nIf you have HPV 6 or HPV 11, your doctor will prescribe medications such as imiquimod (Aldara, Zyclara) or podofilox (Condylox). These are topical medications that destroy genital wart tissue.\nHPV 16 and HPV 18\nHPV 16 is a high-risk HPV strain and usually does not cause any noticeable symptoms. This is the cause of cervical cancer - the most common cancer in women.\nHPV 18 is another high-risk HPV strain. Like HPV 16, it usually causes no symptoms but can lead to cervical cancer.\nHPV 16 and HPV 18 are the cause of about 70% of cervical cancer cases worldwide. HPV vaccination is a way to protect you against these two strains of HPV. (2)",
