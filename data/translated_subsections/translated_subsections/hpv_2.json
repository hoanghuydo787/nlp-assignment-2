    "subsection_content": "According to Dr. Vu Huu Khiem, human papilloma virus (HPV) is very contagious. However, HPV is not transmitted through bodily fluids such as semen or saliva, but rather through skin-to-skin contact. This is most likely to happen during sexual intercourse, such as vaginal, anal, and oral sex. Infection can also occur if HPV comes into contact with mucous membranes (in the mouth, lips, anus, parts of the genital organs) or breaks in the skin, such as vaginal tears.\nIt is estimated that most sexually active people will be infected with HPV at some point. Condoms, when used correctly, help reduce the risk of HPV infection.",
