    "subsection_content": "The following testing methods are often prescribed to diagnose HPV infection:\n1. Pap Smear test (also known as Pap test, cervical cancer smear test)\nThis is a cytological test to collect and analyze cells in the cervix, detecting structural and morphological abnormalities such as metaplasia, dysplasia, etc., which are the seeds of cancer cells, thereby helps detect disease early. Besides, some cervical cells are also used to test for HPV.\nTo perform this test, the doctor will use a speculum to gently insert it into the vagina, expanding and fixing the vaginal wall so that the cervix area can be clearly seen.\nNext, the doctor will use a wooden stick to take a sample from the cervix. These cells are spread onto half of the glass slide in the opaque part, spread thinly and in a single direction, gently and meticulously to avoid cell damage as well as cell clumping. Continue spreading cells on the remaining half of the slide, rotating the brush along the length of the slide. Place the second smear on top of the first smear, send to the laboratory to analyze the results.\nThis process lasts a few minutes and is usually painless. After taking the test sample, the woman may feel discomfort or light vaginal bleeding. This condition rarely occurs, but if it persists, you should immediately notify your doctor for timely intervention and treatment.\n2. Thinprep test\nThinprep is an improved cervical smear test compared to the Pap Smear test. To take a test sample, the doctor will use a cytology brush to take cell samples from the cervical area. Therefore, the amount of cells collected will be greater. The cells were washed in fixative and placed in Thinprep vials, then stored and brought to the laboratory. The specimen is processed completely automatically by extracting and spreading cells onto the glass slide. Finally, the Pathologist will conduct analysis and provide results.\n3. HPV DNA test\nHPV DNA testing uses an automatic DNA extraction system and modern technology to accurately analyze and determine the presence of HPV virus. This method does not confirm 100% whether women have cervical cancer or not, but based on the results obtained, it can detect the disease-causing virus existing in the body, thereby assessing the risk of disease. in the future to take effective preventive measures.\nUsually, the HPV DNA test is performed at the same time as the Pap Smear test or Thinprep test to detect and evaluate abnormal cells at risk of causing cancer early.\n4. Notes when performing HPV virus diagnostic testing\nIn order for the process of diagnosing HPV infection to yield accurate results, women need to remember important notes before performing the tests, including:\nDo not use vaginal lubricants within 24 hours before the test.; Do not perform the test during menstrual days because it may affect the quality of the sample collected. The most appropriate time for testing is at least 5 days after menstruation; Do not take the test within 48 - 72 hours after sexual intercourse.; Do not douche or affect the vaginal area within 2-3 days before the test.; You should immediately notify the doctor who ordered the test if you are taking medication or are in the process of treating a gynecological infection.",
