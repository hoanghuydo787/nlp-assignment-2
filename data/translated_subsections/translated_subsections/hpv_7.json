In fact, about 70 - 90% of people infected with HPV have their immune system clear the virus from their bodies.\nWhen treatment is needed, the goal is to relieve symptoms by removing warts as well as abnormal cells in the cervix. Treatment is usually:\nCryosurgery: Freeze the wart with liquid nitrogen.; Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP): Uses a special loop of wire to remove abnormal cells.; Electrocautery: Burning warts with electric current; Laser therapy: Uses high-intensity light to destroy warts and abnormal cells.; Topical medication: Apply medicated cream directly to the wart (be careful not to use non-prescribed wart treatments on the genitals).",
