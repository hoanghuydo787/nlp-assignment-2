    "subsection_content": "1. Is the HPV virus common?\nHPV is the name of a very common group of viruses. There are more than 100 strains of HPV. It is estimated that about 8 in 10 people will be infected with HPV at some point in their lives. However, it usually does not cause any symptoms and most people will never know they have it. HPV infection does not mean you will definitely get cancer.\n2. Does HPV infection during pregnancy affect the fetus?\nWomen who contract HPV during pregnancy may worry that the virus could harm the fetus, but in most cases it will not affect the developing baby. At the same time, no link was found between HPV and miscarriage, premature birth or other pregnancy complications.\nBesides, the risk of transmitting HPV to the baby during birth is very low. Most babies born to a woman with genital warts do not experience complications related to HPV. In rare cases, babies born to women with genital warts will develop throat warts. This serious condition is called respiratory papilloma, and your child may have laser surgery to prevent the warts from blocking their airways.\nIf the mother is infected with a strain of HPV virus that causes cervical cancer, the baby can still be born safely.\n3. Can HPV infection go away on its own?\nNot all human HPV infections are the same. It is necessary to distinguish between low-risk HPV leading to genital warts and high-risk HPV leading to pre-cancerous and cancerous cells. Usually, HPV goes away on its own without causing health problems. For most people with healthy immune systems, HPV will clear up on its own within 1-2 years. In the following cases, HPV may not go away on its own:\nYou are immunosuppressed - including people with HIV/AIDS or undergoing organ transplants using immunosuppressant drugs, with diseases requiring long-term high-dose corticosteroid treatment...; If you have low-risk HPV and the virus doesn't go away on its own, it can turn into genital warts. In that case, you need to be treated by cutting or burning them off.; If you have high-risk HPV, it will change the cells of the cervix, penis, anus or mouth, thereby developing pre-cancerous cells. If they are not controlled, monitored or treated, they will eventually lead to cancer several years later. This happens in about 10% of people infected with HPV.\n4. Does HPV cause cancer?\nCervical cancer is a common cancer in women related to the HPV virus. Most cases of cervical cancer are caused by this virus. In addition, vaginal cancer, vulvar cancer, penile cancer and anal cancer also originate from the HPV virus. HPV also increases the risk of oral and throat cancer. However, these types of cancer are less common.\n5. Who should get the HPV vaccine?\nHPV vaccination is recommended for ages 9-26. HPV vaccination in this age group offers more benefits, because many people have never been exposed to the HPV virus. To know whether you should get the HPV vaccine or not, you should consult your doctor for advice about the risk of new HPV infections as well as the benefits of getting vaccinated. (5)",
