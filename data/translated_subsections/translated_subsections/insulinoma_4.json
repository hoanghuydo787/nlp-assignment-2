(3)\nTesting techniques help diagnose Insulinoma\nDiagnostic tests and techniques include:\n1. Check blood sugar\nPatients need to do this test if they have symptoms of low blood sugar: tremors, sweating, fast heartbeat, dizziness, headache, feeling hungry, decreased vision, irritability and pale skin.\nIf the blood sugar test result is less than 3.0 mmol/L (symptomatic) or less than 2.2 mmol/L (asymptomatic), the patient needs to have a test and also check insulin levels (sometimes Measure blood levels of C peptide and blood proinsulin when suspected of taking drugs related to insulin) and other hormones in the blood or test for proteins that prevent the pancreas from producing insulin.\n2. Fasting method\nWhen the patient does not show signs of hypoglycemia or the test results at the time of evaluation are unclear.\nFasting helps doctors diagnose insulinoma through regular blood tests to check blood sugar levels.\nThe fasting test usually takes 72 hours (3 days). The patient does not eat or drink anything except water. Your doctor will monitor you regularly for signs of low blood sugar.\nThe test is positive when:\nBlood sugar < 2.5 mmol/l; Serum insulin > 10mmol/l; C-peptide > 2.5 nmol/l; Proinsulin > 0.5 mmol/l\n3. Imaging\nBecause tumors are usually small in size < 2cm, solitary and do not have a specific location on the pancreas, insulin-secreting pancreatic tumors are not easily detected. Abdominal ultrasound usually does not detect tumors.\nIn the past, angiography was considered the gold standard for diagnosing insulinoma with a strongly enhancing tumor in the arterial phase, however, this is an invasive examination and should be replaced by multi-scan computed tomography with contrast injection. X-ray or magnetic resonance imaging of the pancreas.\nEndoscopic ultrasound (EUS): A technique that combines ultrasound and endoscopy to observe inside the patient's food pipe, stomach, pancreas and biliary tract.\nThe doctor uses a long flexible tube (endoscope) with a small camera and light at the end. The hose also has an ultrasonic probe. Ultrasound helps doctors find areas that may be cancerous. They can then take samples (biopsies) of any abnormal areas.\nRadiation scan or octreotide (octreoscan)/PET gallium scan: performed by injecting a low dose of radioactive material into the body, which is absorbed by some neuroendocrine tumor cells and shows up on the scan.",
