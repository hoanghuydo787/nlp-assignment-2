Surgical options include:\nNucleectomy: Surgery is performed by removing the nucleus, like removing the yolk from a hard-boiled egg.; Partial pancreatectomy: This surgery involves removing part of the diseased pancreas.; Whipple surgery: The surgeon will remove part of the pancreas, gallbladder, nearby lymph nodes, and part of the stomach, small intestine, and bile duct if the pancreatic tumor is malignant, meaning the tumor has spread far from the gland. pancreas.\n2. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy\nThis treatment involves injecting a drug into the bloodstream. The drug, after combining with radioactive atoms and amino acids, can target and kill epithelial cells.\n3. Targeted therapy\nTargeted therapy uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells without damaging normal cells.\n4. Using drugs (chemotherapy)\nYour doctor may prescribe certain medications to kill cancer cells. Can be mentioned as:\nDiazoxide: Also known as az OXide dye, helps treat hypoglycemia.; Octreotide/Lanreotide: This is an analog (synthetic version) of somatostatin that helps control neuroendocrine tumor (NET) symptoms. This method treats patients with less predictable melanoma symptoms.; Verapamil and phenytoin: Some patients have reported positive symptoms after using these drugs.",
