    "subsection_content": "If endocrine pancreatic tumor develops early in infancy, the child will fall into a state of prolonged hypoglycemia. This is considered a serious endocrine disease. If not detected and treated early, prolonged hypoglycemia will cause negative effects including: permanent damage to the central nervous system, severe neuropsychiatric sequelae, and even disability in the child. children later.\nFor adults, prolonged and repeated hypoglycemia also leads to irreversible nerve damage. The reason is that the brain organization falls into a state of lack of energy to operate.\nInsulinomas can become a malignant condition but symptoms can develop very slowly and be difficult to detect. Insulinomas can also spread to other parts of the body (metastasize). However, less than 10% of patients develop metastatic endocrine pancreatic tumors. The most common locations that endocrine pancreatic tumors can spread to are the lymph nodes and liver.",
