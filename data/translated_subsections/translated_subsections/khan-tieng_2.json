    "subsection_content": "Some of the most common known causes of hoarseness include:(1)\nTalking too much and too loudly: If you talk too long, cheer too loudly, sing too much, or speak at a higher pitch than usual, you may develop a hoarse voice.; Talking too much and too loudly: If you talk too long, cheer too loudly, sing too much, or speak at a higher pitch than usual, you can develop a hoarse voice.\nPhoto: Singers and MCs are people who are prone to hoarseness.\nAge: As you get older, the structure of the vocal cords degenerates and becomes less elastic, reducing vocal cord vibrations, making your voice more hoarse. Drink alcohol: Drinking too much alcohol can also cause hoarseness. Cold, sore throat, cough, sinus infection: When you have the flu, cough, sore throat or sinus infection, hoarseness will occur but may go away after you recover. Laryngitis: Allergies, colds or upper respiratory infections can cause the vocal cords to become congested, swollen and cause hoarseness. Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD): When too much stomach acid goes up into the throat, it causes laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Laryngeal reflux will damage the larynx and make your voice hoarse. Cysts and polyps: If there are benign polyps and cysts on the vocal cords, they will make your voice hoarse. Vocal cord paralysis: Vocal cord paralysis can lead to hoarseness. Causes of vocal cord paralysis can be due to trauma, cancer of the thyroid gland and mediastinum, infection, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and Parkinson's disease. Laryngeal cancer: Hoarseness that lasts more than 3 weeks without improvement after drug treatment can be one of the symptoms of laryngeal cancer. Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP/laryngeal papillomatosis): This disease causes non-cancerous tumors in the airways that cause hoarseness, the tumors are benign but easily recur. Dyspnea and voice disorders due to muscle tension: Excessive muscle tension in and around the larynx will prevent the vocal cords from opening and closing effectively.; Age: As you get older, the structure of the vocal cords degenerates and becomes less elastic, reducing vocal cord vibrations, making your voice more hoarse.; Drinking alcohol: Drinking too much alcohol can also cause hoarseness; Cold, sore throat, cough, sinus infection: When you have the flu, cough, sore throat or sinus infection, hoarseness will occur but may go away after you recover.; Laryngitis: Allergies, colds or upper respiratory tract infections can cause the vocal cords to become congested, swollen and cause hoarseness.; Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD): When too much stomach acid goes up into the throat, it causes laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Laryngeal reflux will damage the larynx and make your voice hoarse.; Cysts and polyps: If there are benign polyps and cysts on the vocal cords, they will make your voice hoarse.; Vocal cord paralysis: Vocal cord paralysis can lead to hoarseness. Causes: vocal cord paralysis can be due to trauma, thyroid and mediastinal cancer, infection, multiple sclerosis, stroke, Parkinson's disease.; Laryngeal cancer: Hoarseness that lasts more than 3 weeks without improvement after drug treatment can be one of the symptoms of laryngeal cancer.; Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP/laryngeal papillomatosis): This disease causes non-cancerous tumors in the airways that cause hoarseness, the tumors are benign but easily recur.; Dyspnea and voice disorders due to muscle tension: Excessive muscle tension in and around the larynx will prevent the vocal cords from opening and closing effectively.",
