This method allows checking the vibration of the vocal cords and the opening and closing activity of the vocal cords, clearly showing vocal cord lesions suspected of tumors or benign vocal cord lesions.\nPhoto: Patients should see a doctor if hoarseness lasts for more than 2 weeks without improvement.",
