But for cancers that do not start on the vocal cords, hoarseness only occurs after these cancers have progressed to a later stage or have spread to the vocal cords.\nThus, laryngeal cancer progresses silently and has unclear manifestations, so regular cancer screening is very important in protecting health. In particular, if symptoms of hoarseness appear after 2-3 weeks of treatment but do not go away, you should immediately go to the hospital for examination to early detect potentially dangerous health conditions, especially vocal cancer. management – ​​Doctor Hang recommended.",
