    "subsection_content": "Emphysema or emphysema (English: Emphysema) is a disease of the lower respiratory tract, specifically a disease of the alveoli and bronchioles. The alveoli consist of many small sacs containing air. The disease occurs when the walls between these air sacs weaken and burst - creating large air spaces instead of many small ones. This reduces the surface area of ​​the lungs and, therefore, limits the amount of oxygen from the lungs to the blood. (first)\nWhen you exhale, the damaged alveoli do not function normally so old air is trapped, leaving no room for fresh, oxygen-rich air to enter. As a result, you feel short of breath, especially when running or exercising. The disease also causes the lungs to lose elasticity.\nMost patients will also have chronic bronchitis – the second most common form of COPD.",
