    "subsection_content": "There are two main causes of the condition:\n1. Smoking\nTobacco is the main culprit causing lung diseases in general and emphysema syndrome in particular (3). Cigarette smoke paralyzes cilia - which are responsible for sweeping germs, chemicals and irritants out of your airways. Instead, these agents enter the millions of air sacs in the lungs and eventually destroy them.\nStudies show that smokers are about 6 times more likely to develop the disease than non-smokers.\n2. Lack of AAT\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a naturally occurring protein that circulates in the blood. Its main function is to keep white blood cells from damaging normal tissues. These cells will help the body fight infection.\nWhen your body doesn't make enough AAT, normal white blood cells damage the lungs. This harm is worse than smoking. Over time, most people with severe AAT deficiency will develop the disease. Furthermore, patients may also experience liver problems.\nIn addition, there are a number of other causes that contribute to the disease such as:\nPassive smoking: Even if you don't smoke, inhaling cigarette smoke every day will damage your lungs over time. Some studies show that people exposed to large amounts of smoke every day have a higher risk of developing emphysema.; Passive smoking: Even if you don't smoke, inhaling cigarette smoke every day will damage your lungs over time. Some studies show that people exposed to large amounts of smoke every day have a higher risk of developing emphysema.\nAir pollution: People who live or work in areas with highly polluted air, toxic chemical fumes or lung irritants are at higher risk.
