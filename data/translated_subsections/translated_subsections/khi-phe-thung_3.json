The doctor will find out your medical history, ask if you smoke (actively and passively), and if you live/work near polluted areas.\nThen, the doctor assigns you to do paraclinical tests to accurately diagnose the condition of the disease. These tests include:\nImaging tests, such as lung X-rays and CT scans;; Blood test to determine how well the lungs are delivering oxygen to the blood;; Pulse oximetry to measure oxygen content in the blood;; Lung function tests: You will blow into a device called a spirometer to measure how much air your lungs can inhale and exhale. This test also helps determine how well the lungs are supplying oxygen to the blood;; Measure the amount of blood and carbon dioxide in the blood using an arterial blood gas test;; Check heart function and rule out heart disease using an electrocardiogram (ECG).\nImaging diagnostics helps doctors detect lung damage early",
