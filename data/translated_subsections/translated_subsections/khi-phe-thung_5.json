    "subsection_content": "There is no effective treatment for emphysema. All treatments, from medications to surgery, are aimed at minimizing symptoms and slowing the progression of the disease.\nIf you are a smoker, the first step in the treatment process is to quit smoking. Next, depending on the severity of the disease, the doctor may prescribe one of the following methods:\n1. Medicine\nSome medications that help treat emphysema are:\nBronchodilators: open the airways, help the patient breathe easier, and reduce cough;; Steroids: improve shortness of breath;; Mucolytics: thins mucus in the lungs so you can cough it up more easily;; Antibiotics: help fight infection.\nThese medications can be taken orally or inhaled.\n2. Therapy\nPulmonary therapy or moderate-intensity exercise such as light walking is effective in strengthening breathing muscles and reducing symptoms. Thanks to that, you will breathe easier and no longer feel tired. In addition, proper yoga, tai chi and deep breathing exercises also help improve the condition.\nFor people with moderate to severe disease, doctors will use oxygen therapy to help them breathe more easily. Some patients have to breathe oxygen 24 hours a day.\n3. Protein therapy\nSome people with a genetic disease caused by a lack of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein will be prescribed an AAT infusion to slow down the process of lung damage.\n4. Surgery\nWhen the above therapies do not bring the desired results, or when the disease is in a severe stage and the lungs are irreversibly damaged, the doctor will apply the last resort, which is surgery. There are several types of surgical treatment as follows:\nLung volume reduction surgery (LVRS): The doctor removes part or all of the damaged lung, with the goal of allowing the remaining lung to function more effectively. Note that the heart and the rest of the lungs must be really healthy before entering surgery. You will also need to quit smoking and complete a pulmonary rehabilitation program before surgery.; Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS): The doctor removes part or all of the damaged lung, with the goal of allowing the remaining lung to function more effectively.

Damaged parts of the lung will be removed and replaced with new parts. In particular, there are cases where the entire lung must be replaced. The two biggest risks of this type of surgery are infection and rejection of the transplanted organ.; Lung transplant: Patients with severe disease will be considered for lung transplant.
