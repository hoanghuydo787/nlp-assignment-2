(first)\nDoctor Nguyen Thi Quy Khoa said that the hormone Estrogen helps glandular cells develop, thickening the vaginal mucosa and secreting fluid to moisten the vagina. When Estrogen production is reduced, the vulvar vaginal mucosa becomes thinner and drier, less elastic and more vulnerable. This condition is quite common when women enter menopause, called vaginal atrophy.\nStatistics show that about 17% of women in the AFAB group aged 18-50 years old said they experienced vaginal dryness during sex, even before menopause. More than half of cases have vaginal dryness after menopause.",
