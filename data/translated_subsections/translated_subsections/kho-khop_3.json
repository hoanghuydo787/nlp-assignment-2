    "subsection_content": "When it first begins, dry joint disease is often difficult to detect. Because the symptoms are often unclear. However, if paying attention, patients can still notice some unusual signs such as:\n1. Joint pain\nAt the onset, the patient will have mild, transient pain in the affected joint every time they perform contractions, stretches, rotate the joint, or change posture suddenly. Over time, joint pain appears with more frequency. The level of joint pain is now more intense, every time you exercise heavily, walk, run, jump...\n2. Joint stiffness\nIn addition to pain, patients also experience joint stiffness. Especially in the morning, this symptom will be more serious, making it very difficult to stretch the joint.\n3. Joints make sounds\nWhen performing body movements, the joints that become dry are usually the knee and shoulder joints. These joints will make clicking, crunching or cracking sounds. This is the most recognizable symptom of dry joints that needs attention.\n4. Limit movement\nWhen joints are severely dry, the patient's activities are often greatly limited. Joint flexibility is then also reduced.\nIn addition to the above symptoms of dry joints, some cases also have symptoms related to arthritis such as swelling, heat, and redness in the skin around the joints.",
