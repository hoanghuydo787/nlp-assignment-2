This method helps check the presence of bacteria in the joint, blood sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein... to determine and assess the condition of arthritis.; Imaging diagnosis: X-rays, CT scans or MRI scans may be indicated to check for bone spurs, subchondral bone damage, evaluate the extent of soft tissue damage, cartilage wear and other abnormalities. Otherwise, joint fluid secretion does not occur.",
