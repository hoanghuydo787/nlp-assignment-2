    "subsection_content": "Depending on the severity and specific cause, the doctor will create a treatment regimen suitable for each patient. Commonly applied dry joint treatment methods include:\n1. Use medicine\nIn the case of dry joints with pain and arthritis, the doctor may prescribe the patient to use some pain relievers, reduce inflammation, and increase lubricant secretion to improve dryness in the joints. When using these medications, patients need to strictly follow the doctor's instructions, avoid arbitrarily increasing/decreasing the dose, changing the medication, and extending the duration of medication.\nWhen abusing anti-inflammatory drugs for a long time, patients may experience side effects including stomach pain, fluid retention causing edema, blood sugar disorders, and affecting liver and kidney function. Drug abuse and improper treatment can lead to joint stiffness, joint adhesion, and even more serious disability. Dependence on anti-inflammatory drugs can potentially lead to an increased risk of osteoporosis, hypertension, diabetes and other metabolic diseases.\n2. Inject lubricant into the joint\nDoctors often inject Hyaluronic Acid lubricant into joints to improve joint dryness, reduce friction on bone ends, thereby helping joints smooth and reduce pain. However, this type of lubricant is only effective for a short time. The patient is forced to repeat the procedure many times.\nIn addition, joint injections need to be prescribed and performed by an experienced bone and joint specialist. Because just a small mistake when doing it can easily cause joint infection, even joint adhesion and muscle atrophy.\n3. Physical therapy\nPhysical therapy exercises are designed specifically for each patient under the guidance of a doctor or physical therapist. Exercise helps increase strength and flexibility for musculoskeletal joints. When improving the mobility of bones and joints, the fluid regulation in the joints will be more regular, thereby effectively reducing joint dryness from the inside.\n4. Surgery\nThe most serious case of dry joints is complete joint damage, with almost no articular cartilage covering the bone surface. At that time, medical treatments were no longer effective. To restore the normal functioning of joint cartilage, your doctor may consider appointing an artificial joint replacement.",
