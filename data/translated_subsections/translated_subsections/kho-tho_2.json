    "subsection_content": "In some cases, difficulty breathing is considered a normal phenomenon. That's when you exercise too hard, climb mountains/stairs too much, or work hard for long periods of time without resting. This condition will go away on its own after you stop the above physical activities. However, if the condition occurs with continuous frequency and is not caused by strenuous exercise, you are likely suffering from a medical condition.\nIf symptoms appear suddenly, it is called acute dyspnea. The cause is usually:\nExcessive anxiety and stress; Pneumonia; Choking or inhaling foreign objects blocking the respiratory tract; Allergy; Anemia; Exposure to high concentrations of carbon monoxide; Hypotension (low blood pressure); Pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the artery to the lungs); Lung rupture; Hiatus hernia; End-stage incurable disease\nIf a person experiences difficulty breathing compared to normal for more than a month, the condition will be classified as chronic. Causes may be due to:\nAsthma; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); Cardiovascular problems; Overweight – obesity; Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis – a disease that causes scarring of lung tissue\nIn addition, some other lung and heart diseases can also lead to shortness of breath. These diseases include:\nCroup (acute croup); Lung injury; Lung cancer; Pulmonary tuberculosis; Pleurisy (inflammation of the tissues surrounding the lungs); Pulmonary edema (occurs when too much fluid builds up in the lungs); Pulmonary hypertension; Sarcoidosis (clusters of inflammatory cells develop in the lungs); Cardiomyopathy (myocarditis, myocardial dilatation...); Heart arrhythmia; Heart failure; Coronary artery disease; Pericarditis (condition in which the tissues surrounding the heart become inflamed).; Covid-19; Shortness of breath and difficulty breathing after Covid",
