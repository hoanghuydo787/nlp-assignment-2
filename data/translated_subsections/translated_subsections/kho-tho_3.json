Pregnant women\nMild shortness of breath is a very common symptom during pregnancy (2). There are many reasons leading to this phenomenon: pregnant women breathe faster due to an increase in the hormone progesterone (a hormone only secreted during pregnancy), the heart has to work harder, causing the mother to feel short of breath, tired, and hyperemic. Lungs decrease towards the end of pregnancy…\nPregnant women in the last months of pregnancy should rest a lot\n2. People with chronic diseases\nDyspnea can occur when the patient is experiencing the development of certain diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, liver and kidney diseases...\n3. Newborns\nUpper respiratory tract diseases causing acute dyspnea are a relatively common pediatric emergency. In addition, airway malformations, foreign body aspiration and epiglottitis are also common causes of difficulty breathing in newborns.\nNote: Babies' breathing rates are often faster than adults'. Normally, newborns breathe 30 - 60 times/minute, and slow down to 20 times/minute when sleeping. A 6-month-old baby's normal breathing rate will decrease to 25 - 40 times/minute. (3)",
