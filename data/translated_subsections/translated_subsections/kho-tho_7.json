Pulmonary rehabilitation\nIf you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other lung problems, you need care from a pulmonologist. You may have to breathe oxygen to improve; or conduct the \"Pulmonary Rehabilitation\" treatment. This is a \"lung exercise\" program, through which experts will guide you on breathing techniques to help your lungs work more effectively.\n3. Cardiac rehabilitation\nIf the cause of shortness of breath is related to the heart, it means your heart is too weak to pump enough oxygen-carrying blood to the body's organs. Cardiac rehabilitation can then help you manage heart failure and other cardiovascular conditions. In severe cases of heart failure, your doctor will prescribe an artificial pump to take over the task of pumping blood from the weakened heart.",
