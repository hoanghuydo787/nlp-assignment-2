    "subsection_content": "Diagnosis of azoospermia is difficult to detect through external symptoms. Therefore, to diagnose the disease, doctors will mainly rely on semen testing methods.\nThe man's semen sample will be examined by centrifuge or under a microscope. In cases where semen volume is low, doctors must search for more sperm in the urine after ejaculation. The absence of sperm and immature germ cells in the semen suggests complete blockage of the vas deferens.\nIn addition, doctors will prescribe a number of additional tests:\nTest sex hormones, especially testosterone; Chromosomal testing; Computed tomography (CT scan) or ultrasound to check the shape and abnormalities (if any) of the reproductive organs.",
