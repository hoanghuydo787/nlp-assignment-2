    "subsection_content": "A deviated nasal septum is a condition in which your nasal septum is moved significantly to one side, making the air passage on one side of the nose smaller than the other. Deviation occurs when the nasal septum dividing the wings of your nose is moved, causing your nose to become crooked and abnormally deformed. The normal rate of nasal septal stenosis does not affect health. However, if the misalignment is severe, it can cause health complications such as difficulty breathing or blocked nostrils.",
