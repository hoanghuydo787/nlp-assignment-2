    "subsection_content": "Deviated nasal septum has other names such as deviated nasal septum, narrowed nasal septum, nasal septal crest. To classify nasal septum deviation, doctors usually base on the degree of deviation as follows:\nDeviated septum on one side of the nose (C-shaped deviation): Often the nose is blocked on the side of the deviated septum.\nDeviation of nasal septum on one side\nDeviated septum on both sides of the nose (S-shaped): The deviated nasal septum is complex, it can be crooked to the left or to the right. If both sides of the nasal septum are crooked, the nose will be stuffy on both sides. .; Nasal septum spikes or crests: Commonly found at the junction of the bone and cartilage of the septum. Nasal septum spikes or crests can touch the nasal mucosa, causing bleeding and severe pain for the patient.; Septal thickening: This is a condition where the bone is thickened in the lower part of the septum.",
