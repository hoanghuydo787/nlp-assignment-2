In infants, this injury often occurs during childbirth. In children and adults, a variety of accidents can lead to nasal trauma and deviated septum. Being hit in the nose can cause a fracture of the main nasal bone with deformity of the nasal septum. Factors that increase the risk of nasal septum deviation include: Sports injuries, not wearing a seat belt when driving motor vehicles such as cars.\nDue to aging\nNormal aging of the human body can also change the structure of the nose and cause the nasal septum to curve to one side over time.\nDue to infection\nChronic inflammation of the nose, allergic rhinitis, and sinusitis make patients uncomfortable. Frequent nose wiping due to rhinitis at a young age, when the septum is not fully developed, can change the structure of the septum, leading to a crooked nasal septum.\nDue to failed rhinoplasty surgery\nMany failed beauty surgeries such as rhinoplasty and nose wing narrowing also push the nose to one side.",
