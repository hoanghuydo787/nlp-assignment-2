However, if there are symptoms such as nasal congestion, nosebleeds, or sinusitis, the patient needs to go to the hospital for timely examination and treatment by a doctor. Currently, there is no medication to straighten the septum. In most cases, deviated septum affects the function of the nose and sinuses, causes snoring, and frequent bleeding of the nasal vessels, requiring surgical intervention.\nDrug treatment\nDrug treatment mainly reduces symptoms of nasal congestion due to mucosal edema, rhinosinusitis, and allergic rhinitis.; Vasoconstrictor nasal drops: The drug's effect reduces nasal tissue swelling, helping the airways on both sides of the nose stay clear.; Nasal sprays containing corticosteroids: Nasal sprays can reduce swelling in the airways, limiting nasal discharge.; Antihistamines: Medications that help prevent allergy symptoms, including nasal congestion and runny nose.\nSurgical intervention\nSeptum correction surgery is a method often used by doctors when medical treatment with medication fails.\nThe patient is anesthetized, then the surgeon will separate the mucosa covering both sides of the nasal septum, then remove the deviated septum and restore the mucosa to its original position. When excess bone cartilage is removed, the septum and nasal passages will be straightened.\nWhen the surgery is over, the doctor places a soft sponge on one side of the nasal cavity to fix the septum. The patient will be taken to the recovery room until the patient regains consciousness. When the patient is awake, he or she can breathe through one nostril. The next morning, the soft sponge will be removed and breathe through both nostrils. Normally, patients are discharged from the hospital after 1 day and re-examined after 1 week. After septum surgery, patients may have mild nasal congestion, usually lasting 2 to 3 days. Avoid air-conditioning fans rotating directly on the face, gently spray nasal drops, and limit blowing the nose strongly.\nPatients should avoid running and jumping activities for 1 week after surgery. Patients can return to work or school within 2 to 3 days after surgery if they feel ready. (3)",
