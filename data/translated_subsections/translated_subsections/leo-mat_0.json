    "subsection_content": "A stye is an acute swelling of the eyelid margin, which can be on the outside or inside of the eyelid. Styees are caused by infection with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, leading to redness, swelling, pain... Internal styes look like lumps or pustules at the edge of the eyelid [1].

Eye styes are often divided into 3 types:\nMultiple styes: multiple styes on one eyelid, both eyelids, or both eyes; Stye in the eyelid: grows inside the eyelid, usually due to infection from the meibomian gland. Meibomian glands are found in the upper and lower eyelids of the eyes. The gland has the function of secreting a layer of fat to moisten and lubricate the eye surface.; External stye: a stye that grows outside the eyelid margin due to infection of the gland of Zeis.",
