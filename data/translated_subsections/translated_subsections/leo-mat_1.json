    "subsection_content": "Styes are often caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria (staphylococcus aureus bacteria) that infect eyelash follicles. Styes on the outer eyelids are often caused by blockage of sebaceous glands (Zeis) or sweat glands (Moll). The blockage occurs in the lash line and is red, swollen, painful, and develops into pustules. Styes on the inner eyelid are caused by blockage of the meibomian glands and pustules form on the inner surface of the eyelid. Styes can appear on the upper and lower eyelids.\nThe risk of eyelid margin infection causing styes is higher if the following factors are present:\nWearing contact lenses: While wearing and removing glasses, if your hands are not clean, you can easily transmit bacteria from your hands, causing eyelid infections and styes.; Poor hygiene: poor hygiene is a common cause of styes. The habit of rubbing your eyes can easily cause bacteria to come into contact with your eyes. Not washing your face or cleaning your eyes creates opportunities for bacteria that cause styes; Old or dirty eye makeup: Eye makeup tools left unsanitized for a long time can collect dust and bacteria. Makeup is a catalyst for dust and bacteria to come into contact with the eyes, causing swelling and infection, forming a stye.; Blepharitis, inflammation or infection of the eyelids: acute or chronic blepharitis. Blepharitis can cause swelling and pus under the eyelids; Rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis or diabetes.\nThe patient has a stye on the lower eyelid.",
