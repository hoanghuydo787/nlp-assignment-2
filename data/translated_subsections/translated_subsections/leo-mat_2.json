After 1-2 days, the eyes may become watery and a bit scratchy. The inflammation can be severe sometimes with fever or chills. Checking the conjunctiva will see a small yellow area protruding above the stye. Sometimes a stye can rupture  or dissolve on its own. Fluid from a burst stye needs to be cleaned.",
