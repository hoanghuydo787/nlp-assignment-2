    "subsection_content": "1. Is a stye the same as a chalazion?\nStye and chalazion are two different diseases that are often difficult to distinguish [6]. Chalazions form around the sebaceous glands and between the eyelids. Chalazion is caused by the breakdown of secretions in leaking or blocked oil glands, causing swelling but little pain. Chalazion often develops into a painless granuloma that is considered a chronic, sterile inflammatory condition. While styes form due to bacterial infection in oil glands or eyelid margins.\n2. Can a stye go away on its own?\nA stye can heal on its own if you know how to take care of your eyes properly [7]. Keep your eyes clean and your eyelids clear. Do not touch the stye in the eye. You should shield your eyes from dust and dirt with protective glasses. In addition, warm compresses also help styes disappear faster when self-treating at home.\n3. Are styes contagious?\nStyes are not contagious, so there is no need to be afraid when contacting and communicating with someone who has a stye.",
