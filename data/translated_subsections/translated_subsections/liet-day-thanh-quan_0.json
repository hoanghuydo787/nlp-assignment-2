    "subsection_content": "Vocal cord paralysis is a condition in which one or both vocal cords cannot perform their function, due to neurological or muscle paralysis. When breathing, the vocal cords open, and when swallowing, they close tightly. However, when speaking, air passing from the lungs causes the vocal cords to oscillate between open and closed positions. If the vocal cords are paralyzed in an open position, the airways and lungs are not protected.(1)\nVocal cord paralysis is divided into types including:\n1.1 Paralysis of the vocal cords on both sides\nBilateral vocal cord paralysis is one of the rare and life-threatening diseases. Usually, paralysis of both vocal cords occurs due to trauma during surgery in the neck and chest, endotracheal intubation, neurodegeneration, etc.\n1.2 Vocal cord paralysis on one side\nUnilateral vocal cord paralysis, also known as single vocal cord paralysis, is a common disease, often caused by brain damage such as brain tumors, strokes, damage to the nerves that control the larynx... All ages and genders are affected. It is possible to have this disease, but women have a higher incidence than men.\nThere are two types of unilateral vocal cord paralysis including left vocal cord paralysis and right vocal cord paralysis.\nLeft vocal cord paralysis: Most patients with vocal cord paralysis often have paralysis on the left side more than the right side. The reason is because the left vocal cord is more related to parts of the chest than the right vocal cord, such as the aortic arch, atrium...; Left vocal cord paralysis: Most patients with vocal cord paralysis often have paralysis on the left side more than the right side. The reason is because the left vocal cord is more related to parts of the chest than the right vocal cord, such as the aortic arch, atrium...\nRight vocal cord paralysis: There are few cases of right vocal cord paralysis because it only originates from the vagus nerve, bypasses the right subclavian artery and superior aortic arch and then reaches the larynx. This position usually has little injury, causing paralysis.; Right vocal cord paralysis: There are few cases of right vocal cord paralysis because it only originates from the vagus nerve, bypasses the right subclavian artery and superior aortic arch and then reaches the larynx.
