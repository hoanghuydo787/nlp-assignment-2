    "subsection_content": "To accurately assess vocal cord damage, doctors can perform the following methods:(4)\n5.1 Laryngoscopy\nThe doctor uses a small, soft endoscope with a camera attached to the end of the tube and inserts it into the patient's throat. Thereby, the doctor can directly view the vocal cords through the screen as well as determine the position and movement of the vocal cords to make the most accurate diagnosis.\n5.2 Laryngeal electromyography\nThis is a method of measuring the electrical current in the patient's laryngeal muscles. To perform this method, the doctor will use a small needle, piercing the skin of the neck to the muscle area of ​​the vocal cords to measure the force of nerve signals from the brain to the muscles that control the vocal cords.\n5.3 Blood tests and imaging tests\nBecause some diseases can cause damage to the nerves that control the vocal cords, it is necessary to perform additional tests to determine the exact cause of paralysis. These tests can be blood tests, lung function tests, X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT scans of the neck and chest area, etc.",
