Typically, patients will be treated with voice therapy, surgery, or even both.\n7.1 Speech therapy\nInclude exercises or activities that stimulate the vocal cords, improve breath control when speaking, and prevent abnormal tension of paralyzed vocal cords.\n7.2 Surgery\nWhen using voice therapy but the vocal cords cannot be restored, the patient needs surgery to improve speaking and swallowing abilities. Surgical methods include:\nFiller injections: vocal cord paralysis can cause the muscles to become thin and weak. To make the muscles thicker and stronger, the doctor can inject autologous fat, hyaluronic acid, collagen or some other fillers into the vocal cords; Filler injections: vocal cord paralysis can cause the muscles to become thin and weak. To make the muscles thicker and stronger, the doctor can inject autologous fat, hyaluronic acid, collagen or some other filler into the vocal cords.\nVocal cord transposition: the doctor will move the tissue window from the outside to the inside of the larynx, pushing the paralyzed vocal cords to the middle of the larynx, helping the vocal cords function better.; Vocal cord transposition: the doctor will move the tissue window from the outside to the inside of the larynx, pushing the paralyzed vocal cords to the middle of the larynx, helping the vocal cords function better.\nTracheostomy: if both vocal cords are completely paralyzed, airflow into the lungs will be reduced, making it difficult for the patient to breathe. Therefore, the doctor needs to perform a tracheostomy by making an incision in front of the tissue window, creating an opening into the trachea and then inserting a breathing tube. Then, air can follow the tube through the paralyzed vocal cords.; Tracheostomy: if both vocal cords are completely paralyzed, airflow into the lungs will be reduced, making it difficult for the patient to breathe.
