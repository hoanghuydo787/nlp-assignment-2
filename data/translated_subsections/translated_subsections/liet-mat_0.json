    "subsection_content": "Facial paralysis, also known as 7th nerve palsy or Bell's palsy, is a peripheral nerve disease of unknown cause. This is a condition in which one side of the facial muscles becomes weak or sagging due to damage or loss of function of the nerves controlling the facial muscles. Most patients with facial paralysis can recover completely, but some have lifelong sequelae. Bilateral facial paralysis is very rare with an incidence of only 0.3-2% of facial paralysis.",
