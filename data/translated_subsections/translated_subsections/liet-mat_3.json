Clinical manifestations\nObserve facial asymmetry; Closing the eyes on the paralyzed side is not tight, the wrinkles of the nose, cheeks, and corners of the mouth are lost compared to the healthy side; General examination, ear examination, palpation of tumors and tumors in the jaw area; Assess motor function, ask the patient to: Raise both eyebrows (frowse), close both eyes tightly, smile, puff cheeks, purse lips; Shows both upper and lower teeth (when frowning); Assessment of special sensory functions, if clinically indicated: Sensation of the face and ears, taste sensation of the anterior 2/3 of the tongue\n2. Imaging\nImaging is not recommended in the initial evaluation of Bell's palsy, unless symptoms such as contralateral hemiplegia, vertigo, associated unsteadiness and loss of limb coordination are present, or other paralytic cases are present. Facial paralysis caused by tumors (eg, facial neuroma, cholesteatoma, hemangioma, meningioma), progressive facial paralysis. Usually, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended in the above cases.\n3. Electrical neuromuscular measurement (EMG)\nEMG is often indicated in facial nerve palsy, it can help assess the extent of nerve damage and recovery, and is performed at least 1 week after symptom onset to avoid false negative results.\n4. Testing\nComplete analysis of blood cells to determine infection or leukemic disorders, fasting blood sugar - Hemoglobin A1c to find the cause of diabetes.\n5. Serum antibodies to herpes zoster\nCerebrospinal fluid analysis is indicated when bilateral facial paralysis occurs in the setting of acute demyelinating polyradiculoneuritis (also known as Guillain-Barré syndrome).",
