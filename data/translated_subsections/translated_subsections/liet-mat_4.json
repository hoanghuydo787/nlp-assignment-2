In diabetics and pregnant women, consideration should be given depending on the case.\nEye protection: One of the biggest problems with facial paralysis is eye damage due to poor eye closure and a slow eye closing reflex. Therefore, patients need to carefully protect and care for their eyes to avoid complications that can lead to impaired eye function. Patients should protect their corneas from dehydration, dryness or scratches with day and night eye ointment as prescribed by their doctor.
