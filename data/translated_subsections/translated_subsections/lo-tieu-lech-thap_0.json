    "subsection_content": "Hypospadias is a congenital malformation of the urinary tract in boys. The child's urinary opening is lower than the normal position. This condition occurs when the patient's urethra is too short, causing the urinary opening to lie far from the top of the glans.\nThe urethra normally opens at the tip of the penis. However, when a child has hypospadias, the urethra opens on the underside of the glans, shaft of the penis, scrotum or perineum. The disease becomes more serious when the distance between the urinary opening and the tip of the glans becomes larger, making treatment extremely difficult. (first)\nHypospadias is a common birth defect, with an incidence of 1/300 boys. Children with this malformation, if not treated early, may become infertile in the future, especially in cases of hypospadias in the middle of the shaft of the penis or at the base of the scrotum accompanied by curvature of the penis.",
