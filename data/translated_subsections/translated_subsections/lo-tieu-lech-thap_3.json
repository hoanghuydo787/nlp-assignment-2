In addition, some other causes of this defect include: (3)\nDefective epidermal growth factors on the ventral surface of the penis; Vascular defects in the penile area; Enzymes are also associated with neonatal hypospadias due to deficiencies in testosterone biosynthesis; In vitro fertilization (IVF) is one of the causes that increases the incidence of hypospadias in boys.\nIn vitro fertilization may increase the child's risk of hypospadias",
