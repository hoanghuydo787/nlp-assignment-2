    "subsection_content": "Hypospadias defects usually do not cause difficulty urinating. However, the urinary tract (urethra) is likely to be poorly developed. When hypospadias is severe, boys have to urinate sitting down like women. Therefore, the severity of the impact will depend on the location of the urinary tract.\nPeople with hypospadias may have a curved penis. Penile curvature in boys, if left untreated, can cause many difficulties during sexual intercourse in adulthood. For severe curvature of the penis, patients need to have multiple surgeries to correct it. In addition, hypospadias accompanied by penile curvature can lead to infertility in the future when there is no early intervention.",
