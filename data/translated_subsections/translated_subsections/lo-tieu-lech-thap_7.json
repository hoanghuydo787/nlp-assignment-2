    "subsection_content": "The main treatment for hypospadias is surgery. The doctor performing this technique must have experience in the field of disease treatment, understand microsurgery as well as grasp the baby's psychology.\nChildren with this defect should be treated surgically between 3 and 6 months of age. Note that late surgery should not be performed when the child is after 18 months of age. Early surgery will help increase the success rate of treatment, thereby avoiding guilt for the child later. However, children with small penises may need surgery later. Surgery is not contraindicated in adults.\n1. Purpose of surgery\nThe purpose of surgery is to bring the urinary opening to the top of the glans, creating a straight shape for the penis; Thanks to that, children can avoid feeling self-conscious when they grow up and minimize the risk of infertility in the future.\n2. Number of surgeries\nMost cases of hypospadias are corrected in just one surgery. Except for some severe cases, patients may need 2 surgeries.\n3. Postoperative complications\nUrethral fistula is the most common complication after surgery to treat hypospadias, about 10 - 20%. In addition, patients are also at risk of urethral strictures and urethral diverticula after surgery. To limit risks after surgery, patients should be treated at reputable medical facilities with a team of experienced doctors and modern medical equipment.",
