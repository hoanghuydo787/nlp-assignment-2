    "subsection_content": "Osteoporosis (osteoporosis, brittle bones) is a condition in which bones continuously thin. Bone density gradually decreases over time, making bones more brittle, easily damaged and broken even with minor trauma. Osteoporotic fractures can occur in any bone. Among them, the most common are fractures of the spine, femur and forearm. Some bones, when broken, will not be able to heal, such as the spine and femur. These cases often require expensive surgical treatment. (first)\nThe disease often progresses silently. Patients may feel unclear pain, height loss, and hunchback and curvature of the spine. These are symptoms that are only discovered after a long period of time. In some cases, the disease is only discovered when there are signs of bone fracture.\nThe older you get, the more severe osteoporosis will become. As we get older, bone metabolism changes, causing disorders in bone formation and bone destruction, leading to reduced bone density.",
