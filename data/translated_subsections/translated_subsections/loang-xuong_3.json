    "subsection_content": "Osteoporosis is classified based on the cause of the disease. Based on bone density measurement results, doctors divide the disease into many different levels. Each classification will show the progression and severity of each patient.\nAccording to the cause of the disease, osteoporosis is divided into 2 types:\nPrimary osteoporosis\nIn this case, the development of the disease is directly related to age or menopause in middle-aged women. The disease mechanism begins with aging from osteoblasts.\nThis condition causes an imbalance between the number of newly regenerated bone cells and destroyed bone tissue, leading to reduced bone density. Primary osteoporosis includes:\nPostmenopausal (osteoporosis type 1)\nThe cause of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women is a decrease in the hormone estrogen. In addition, decreased parathyroid hormone production and increased urinary calcium excretion also contribute to bone density becoming thinner.\nType 1 osteoporosis mainly affects women between the ages of 50 and 55 and postmenopausal. Typical symptoms include:\nMineral loss of spongy bone; Fracture; Subsidence of vertebrae\nOld age (osteoporosis type 2)\nAs you get older, the risk of osteoporosis increases. Because of the calcium metabolism function, the nutrients needed for bones were gradually weakened, causing an imbalance in bone formation and bone destruction. The disease affects both men and women, especially people aged 70 and over. Type 2 osteoporosis has the following characteristics:\nGlobal demineralization: This condition occurs in both spongy and compact bones; Older people with osteoporosis are more likely to have complications than younger people, the most common being femoral neck fractures.\nSecondary osteoporosis\nSecondary osteoporosis often has a clearly identifiable cause. The onset of this osteoporosis condition is mainly related to chronic diseases in the body or incorrect medication use habits. Common causes of secondary osteoporosis include:\nHyperthyroidism; Diabetes; Acromegaly; Chronic liver disease; Have a history of gastric bypass; Hemochromatosis and other genetic diseases; The body is deficient in nutrients; Using diuretics for a long time or overusing drugs such as corticosteroids or heparin; Suffering from spinal diseases; Rheumatoid arthritis; Suffering from multiple myeloma (Kahler) and other cancers",
