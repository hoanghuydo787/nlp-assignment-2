    "subsection_content": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has established standards for determining osteoporosis through bone density measurement (BMD) results. First, your BMD results will be compared with the BMD results of a healthy 25 - 35 year old person of the same gender and ethnicity as you. Standard deviation (SD) is the difference between your BMD and a healthy 25 - 35 year old person, called the T score.\nT-score within 1 SD (+1 or -1): Normal bone density.; T-score about 1 – 2.5 SD below average (-1 to 2.5 SD): Osteopenia; T-score about 2.5 SD or more below the average (more than -2.5 SD): Osteoporosis\nIn addition to the T-score, your BMD is also compared to the BMD of a healthy person of the same age (Z-score). The Z-score shows whether your bone density is lower or higher than that of healthy people of the same age, gender, height, weight and race. The Z score is evaluated as follows:\nZ score above -2.0: Normal; Z score = +0.5, -0.5 or -1.5: Popular with premenopausal women; Z score ≤ -2.0: Bone density is lower than the age group standard",
