Common areas where bone density measurements are performed are the spine, hips or forearm bones. The purpose of this diagnostic method is to detect problems with osteoporosis (thin, weak bones) and bone loss (reduced bone mass).\nCurrently, Tam Anh General Hospital system is a reliable address for you to feel secure in performing osteoporosis measurements. All machine systems at the hospital are new generation and advanced. Therefore, patients will receive results very quickly and with high accuracy. In addition, the hospital also has a team of experienced doctors with high expertise in the field of image diagnosis, who will provide accurate diagnoses through the results obtained.\nProdigi bone mineral density measuring machine (GE/Mexico) at Tam Anh General Hospital System\nThe osteoporosis machine system at Tam Anh General Hospital system not only has the function of measuring bone density to diagnose osteoporosis, but also integrates many important functions such as assessing the risk of bone fractures and calcification. ... The outstanding advantages of the machine compared to previous generations are the high-frequency dual-energy X-ray source, the OnePass one-time scanning feature that helps eliminate image distortion errors, and high resolution, thereby exporting images. High quality, clear.\nBlood and urine tests\nIn addition to measuring osteoporosis, your doctor may also recommend blood and urine tests. These tests will help check hormone levels and look for risks that increase bone loss such as vitamin or mineral deficiencies in the body.",
