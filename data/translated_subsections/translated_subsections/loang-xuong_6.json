    "subsection_content": "When patients do not receive timely treatment or are treated improperly, complications of osteoporosis may appear such as: (4)\nFractures: Osteoporosis reduces bone density, making bones weak, brittle, and prone to breaking. In some cases, just a slight collision, bending over, coughing or sneezing can cause bone fractures. Because the spine, femur, forearm, arm, and leg bones are the bones that bear the most impact in the body. Therefore, when osteoporosis occurs, these are the bones that are most commonly affected. Femoral neck fractures, forearm fractures, and hip fractures are common conditions in elderly osteoporosis patients.; Vertebrae collapse: Vertebrae collapse due to osteoporosis can lead to permanent disability. In addition, this complication can cause nerve roots to be compressed, causing lasting pain. A large number of damaged vertebrae can cause spinal degeneration to progress faster.; Impaired mobility: People with osteoporosis may be permanently disabled. This condition reduces quality of life, especially in older adults. Patients often have to lie motionless in one place for long periods of time. This can lead to other complications such as pneumonia, necrosis, limb embolism...",
