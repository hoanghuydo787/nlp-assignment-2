    "subsection_content": "The simplest way to diagnose breast dents is to check the shape of the chest to see if there are dents or not. Besides, the doctor may recommend some paraclinical tests, the purpose of which is to check for problems related to the heart and lungs. This paraclinical indication includes:\nChest X-ray: gives an image of the concave part of the sternum and whether the heart is compressed, leading to displacement to the left side of the chest; CT or MRI scan: helps determine the severity of the chest dent and whether the heart or lungs are compressed. Chest CT helps measure the Haller index (Haller index – HI). The normal index is 2.5. If it is greater than 3.2, it is a condition of severe chest depression; Electrocardiogram: shows whether the heart beats normally or irregularly, whether the electrical signals that control the heart rate are generated properly or not; Echocardiogram: helps doctors see how the chest wall affects heart function and blood flow through the heart. Echocardiography also helps check for other defects such as mitral valve prolapse, and evaluate the aortic root and valve in Marfan syndrome.; Respiratory function test: is a measure of air flows when inhaling/exhaling, thereby calculating important lung function indicators such as the amount of air the lungs can hold and the speed of lung emptying. ; Strenuous exercise: tracks how your heart and lungs work when you exercise, usually on a stationary bike or treadmill.",
