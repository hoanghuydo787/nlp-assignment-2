    "subsection_content": "Chest depression can be completely cured if detected early and with a suitable treatment regimen. The two most popular sternotomy methods are Ravitch and Nuss: (4)\nRavitch surgery: The doctor removes the excessive costal cartilage but retains the perichondrium and fixes the sternum in its normal position. The costal cartilage will then grow along the perichondrium left behind and create a new framework, holding the sternum in a corrected and fixed position.\nThe Ravitch method has the disadvantage of leaving large scars, causing the chest after surgery to no longer be concave, but long, unsightly scars appear.\nNuss surgery: This is a minimally invasive surgical method that has been widely applied recently. The doctor only opened small incisions on both sides of the chest to insert the camera into the chest, thereby clearly observing the heart and large blood vessels, helping the surgery to take place safely and minimize complications. Thus, compared to the Ravitch method, which requires cutting the sternum and rib cartilage, the Nuss surgery limits bleeding, reduces pain and ensures aesthetics for the patient.\nDoctor Nguyen Do Trong said, depending on the degree of concavity and the shape of the concave chest, whether it affects the function of the heart and lungs, whether it is combined with other congenital defects, etc., the doctor will decide when for surgery to treat sunken breasts.\nCases of severe chest indentation, affecting cardiopulmonary function or combined with congenital heart defects should be treated early. In case of simple and moderate chest depression, the appropriate age for treatment is 6-18 years old. If surgery is performed too early, the bones will not be fully developed; On the contrary, if treatment is too late when the skeleton has formed, the patient will be very painful.\nAfter breast augmentation surgery, patients often have pain when breathing (because breathing affects the entire rib cage and chest). The older the patient is or has a lower pain threshold, the less pain they can tolerate. Therefore, how to reduce pain to a minimum while still ensuring maximum safety for the patient is the top priority in surgery to treat pectus excavatum.\nAt the Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, Tam Anh General Hospital, doctors apply the method of anesthesia of the erector spinae plane. Accordingly, the catheter is placed into the erector spinae muscle space next to the spine. When injecting anesthetic into this cavity, it will have the effect of blocking pain signals, minimizing the use of morphine after surgery. Thanks to that, patients have less pain, can move normally after surgery, recover quickly and leave the hospital early.\nChest concavity surgery combined with endoscopy was performed by doctors from the Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City.\nFor children with mild to moderate pectus excavatum and no indication for surgery, Dr. Trong suggests some exercises that can help improve breast shape as well as reduce uncomfortable symptoms, such as:\nStraight back exercise: Stand as straight as possible, pull your shoulders back. Take a deep breath and hold for 10 seconds, then exhale. Repeat 20 times.; Chest expansion exercise: Stand straight, interlace your fingers and place them behind your head. Pull your elbows back slightly to open up your chest more. Bend your hips slightly forward, keeping your back straight. Hold the position for up to 3 seconds, then repeat 25 times.\nRegular physical activity can also be helpful with mild cases of pectus excavatum. Note that children need to choose a sport appropriate to their age and should not exercise too much.",
