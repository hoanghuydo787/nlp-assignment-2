    "subsection_content": "Like other major surgeries, surgery to repair pectus excavatum also carries risks. Possible complications are:\nPneumothorax; Pleural effusion; Heavy bleeding; Infection; Recurrence of pectus excavatum after removal of the lift; Damage to nearby organs such as the heart, lungs, large blood vessels...; Preventing recurrence of sunken breasts\nThe recurrence rate of pectus excavatum after surgery using the Ravitch and Nuss method is less than 1%. To prevent this situation from happening, after discharge from the hospital, the child needs to maintain a straight chest position, avoid twisting, hunching, or misaligning the breast augmentation bar. At the same time, children should limit practicing contact sports and strenuous activities to minimize the risk of collapsed lung.\nAfter surgery, parents need to take their children for scheduled follow-up visits. About 2 years after surgery, when the sternum is stable and firm in a flat position, the child will have a second surgery to remove the breast augmentation bar, completing the treatment process. In cases where children have surgery after the age of 18, it usually takes 3-4 years before the breast augmentation bar can be removed.\nThe Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery at Tam Anh General Hospital brings together a team of experienced doctors in diagnosing and treating cardiovascular, thoracic, and vascular diseases. It is equipped with advanced machinery systems to help accurately diagnose diseases and support doctors in conducting minimally invasive surgeries such as coronary artery bypass surgery without using cardiopulmonary bypass, heart valve replacement surgery. Small incisions, minimally invasive vascular surgery, endoscopic surgery to correct thoracic defects, thoracoscopic surgery to remove lung tumors, hybrid technique - combining surgery and intervention..., thereby improving effective treatment and shorten recovery time for patients.\nTo schedule an examination, consultation and treatment at the Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital System, you can contact:\nPectus excavatum is a congenital disease that can be detected after a child is born and appears clearly during puberty.
