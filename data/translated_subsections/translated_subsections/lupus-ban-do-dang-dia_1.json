    "subsection_content": "Based on many factors such as manifestations, characteristics, severity, distribution... discoid lupus erythematosus is divided into 2 main types as follows: (2)\nBasic disc format\nIn basic discoid lupus erythematosus, there are also 3 subtypes below:\nLocalized discoid lupus erythematosus\nCharacteristic of this type of lupus erythematosus is the concentration of lesions. Most lesions are localized in the neck area. With this type of lupus, the damage is usually not too serious and is relatively easier to control than with other types.\nSystemic discoid lupus erythematosus\nContrary to the type above, this condition is not fixed in one area but causes damage in many different locations on the body. In particular, commonly damaged locations include: neck, arms, chest, head...\nDiscoid lupus erythematosus in childhood\nAs the name suggests, this is a form of lupus erythematosus that often appears in young children, with no difference between men and women. Having this type of lupus can lead to serious damage and progression of other organ damage of systemic lupus erythematosus.\nSpecial disc format\nAccording to morphological characteristics, discoid lupus erythematosus is divided into 2 subtypes including:\nHypertrophic lupus erythematosus\nThis type of lupus has the basic characteristics of spreading with a thick layer of scales covering it. Beneath the surface of the lesion there is a thick layer of keratin.\nLupus erythematosus and panniculitis (lupus profundus)\nLupus erythematosus panniculitis often appears concurrently with dermatitis caused by lupus panniculitis - a form of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus, accompanied by discoid lupus erythematosus or other manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus. Characteristics of lupus erythematosus with panniculitis are that the lesions are hard, nodular nodules with surrounding borders.",
