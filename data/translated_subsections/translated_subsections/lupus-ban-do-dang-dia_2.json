The total score of the CLASI index is calculated on the basis of 12 anatomical locations, based on 2 parameters: activity score and total damage score. (3)\nTotal performance score is based on:\nDegree of skin redness (0–3); Mucosal lesions (0–1); Current hair loss (0–1), intermittent hair loss (0–3)\nTotal injury score is based on:\nDegree of skin pigmentation disorder (0–2). The condition of dyspigmentation lasting more than 12 months doubles the number of dyspigmentation points.; Skin scars (0-2), for scalp scars (0, 3, 4, 5, 6)",
