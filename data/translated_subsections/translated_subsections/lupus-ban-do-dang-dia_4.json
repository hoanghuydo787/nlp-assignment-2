    "subsection_content": "Clinical symptoms\nDiscoid lupus erythematosus manifests itself as lesions on the skin, from an initial pale pink patch, becoming red and rough. This condition can occur anywhere on your body, especially the neck, palms, soles of the feet and the area below the elbows, and more rarely it can affect the ear canal.\nSymptomatic features include:\nCircular lesions leave scars; Thick scales appear on the skin and scalp; The damaged area blisters and peels, especially around the elbow and fingertips; Thin skin; Skin pigmentation becomes lighter or darker and may not fade; Scalp thickening, hair loss and may not grow back; Nails are brittle and break easily; There are ulcers inside the lips; Some people experience itchy skin; Usually, symptoms may flare up for a certain period of time and then subside.\nSubclinical symptoms\nBesides observing clinical symptoms, doctors need to prescribe some additional paraclinical methods to identify discoid lupus erythematosus as follows:\nSerum testing\nPatients will usually have blood tests at the time of diagnosis and afterward to check for:\nAntinuclear antibodies (ANA, ANF; if present, they are usually of low titer); Extractable anti-nuclear antibody (ENA).; Anti-annexin 1 antibodies – this may be a diagnostic sign; Antiphospholipid antibodies (APLs); Antibodies to Sm – a protein found in cell nuclei; Anti-dsDNA antibody – a protein directed against double-stranded DNA; Antibodies to Ro(SSA) and La(SSB) – two antibodies often found together.; Kidney function to evaluate kidney damage; CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (VS); Complete blood count to identify abnormalities in white and red blood cell counts.\nUrine test\nIn addition to blood tests, doctors may also order urine tests to evaluate the effects of systemic lupus erythematosus on the kidneys. Test indicators often include:\nUrinary protein (albumin)/creatinine is intended to estimate protein (or albumin) in urine.; Urine analysis test to initially evaluate proteinuria and hematuria.\nSkin biopsy\nBiopsies of the skin, kidneys, and joint synovium are also one of the ways to diagnose and evaluate the condition of discoid lupus erythematosus. The tissue will be removed through minor surgery and examined under a microscope to detect IgM, IgG and complement immunoglobulin deposits in the glomeruli to identify signs of systemic lupus erythematosus.\nSkin biopsy helps diagnose discoid lupus erythematosus",
