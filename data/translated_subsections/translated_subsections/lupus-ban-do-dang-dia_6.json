    "subsection_content": "Once it is determined that you have discoid lupus erythematosus, doctors will develop a treatment regimen in the following order:\nTopical therapy; Topical Steroids; Steroids are used to help reduce inflammation. You can apply corticosteroid ointment, cream, or your doctor will inject it; Steroids directly into damaged skin. Oral prednisone can help reduce damage by reducing the production of antibodies and anti-inflammatory cells. However, steroids easily cause thinning of the skin, so you need to use the correct dosage and have medical supervision.\nNon-Steroid Topical\nNonsteroidal ointments and creams, such as Calcineurin inhibitors like topical tacrolimus, can also help reduce inflammation. This is a group of drugs prescribed to adults alone or in combination with Methotrexate. Particularly for children, this medicine needs to be used sparingly.\nPimecrolimus\nThis is a drug prepared in the form of a topical cream, does not contain steroids, has anti-inflammatory effects, and regulates the immune system. Medicines can be used for short or long term treatment, depending on the condition and often have some side effects such as: pain and increased risk of infections...\nAnti-malaria medication\nAnother way to reduce systemic inflammation in patients is to use antimalarial drugs. These oral medications include hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine and quinacrine... which have the ability to reduce lymphocyte proliferation, reduce the production of autoantibodies, create a physical photoprotective barrier and reduce inflammation. Normally, when using these drugs, patients should have their eyes checked periodically every year to screen for side effects on the eyes of the drugs.\nSystemic corticosteroids\nSystemic corticosteroids such as Prednisolone and Prednisone can also be used in the treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus to fight inflammation, suppress the immune system, and keep the lesions from spreading. Common side effects of this drug are quite many, typically glaucoma, cataracts, osteoporosis, stomach ulcers, mental disorders...\nImmunosuppressive drugs\nImmunosuppressive drugs such as mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, tacrolimus... have the ability to reduce the production of inflammatory cells, reduce the body's excessive immune response, helping to relieve itching, inflammation, and edema of the patient. improved.",
