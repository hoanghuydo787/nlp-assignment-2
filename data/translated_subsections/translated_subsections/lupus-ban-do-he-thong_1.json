This period is called remission, but this does not mean the patient is cured. sick.\nLupus is a chronic autoimmune disease that can cause inflammation and pain in any part of the body. Lupus often affects the skin, joints, and internal organs such as the kidneys or lungs. There are 4 forms of lupus including:\nWhole body lupus (systemic lupus) accounts for about 70% of all lupus cases. In about half of these cases, a major organ or organs in the body, such as the heart, lungs, kidneys or brain, will be affected. Some dangerous complications can occur such as lupus nephritis, affecting glomerular filtration rate, and in severe cases, kidney damage may require dialysis or kidney transplant.; Cutaneous lupus (affecting only the skin) accounts for about 10% of all lupus cases. Cutaneous lupus can manifest with cutaneous erythema or discoid erythema. The rash may be raised, scaly, and usually does not itch. Skin rashes or sores often appear on the face, neck, scalp (where the skin is exposed to sunlight or fluorescent light) or the lining of the nose, mouth or vagina.
