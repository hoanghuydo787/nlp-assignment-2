If the immune system is \"faulty\", instead of creating disease-fighting antibodies, it attacks itself. healthy tissues of the body. Over time, other immune cells will also participate in this \"civil war\", leading to inflammation and damage to tissues in the system.\nUp to now, researchers have not yet been able to explain the reason why these reactions occur. According to many studies, it may be due to a combination of genetic, hormonal and environmental factors. These environmental factors can include viruses, sunlight and allergies, and agents such as pollution or dust. People with lupus may also have an impaired ability to clear old and damaged cells from the body, which leads to abnormal immune responses. (2)\n1. Hormones\nHormones are considered the body's messengers because they participate in regulating many body functions. Because 9 out of 10 cases of lupus are in women, researchers have looked at the relationship between estrogen and lupus.\nWhile men and women both produce estrogen, women produce more estrogen. Many women have additional lupus symptoms before their period or during pregnancy when estrogen production is high. This may suggest that estrogen somehow affects the severity of lupus.\nResearchers have long been concerned that the female hormone estrogen or estrogen treatment could cause lupus or make it worse. However, based on recent studies, the results show that the use of estrogen in therapy can lead to the activation of some mild or moderate lupus exacerbations, but this does not relieve symptoms. The disease becomes more severe or causes severe flare-ups.\n2. Genetics\nCurrently, more than 50 genes have been identified that are linked to lupus. These genes are more commonly found in people with lupus than in people without the disease. Most of these genes have not been shown to directly cause lupus, but they are believed to contribute to the disease.\nIn most cases genetic determination is not enough. This is especially evident with twins who are raised in the same environment and have similar genetic characteristics but only one develops lupus. However, when one identical twin has lupus, the chance that the other twin is at risk also increases (30% risk in identical twins; 5-10% risk in monozygotic twins). muscle for fraternal twins).\nLupus can develop in people who have no family history of the disease, but do have other autoimmune diseases in some family members.\nCertain ethnic groups such as people of African descent, Asians, Hispanics, Latinos, Native Americans, Native Hawaiians, or Pacific Islanders have an increased risk of developing lupus. This explanation may be related to the common genetic code.\n3. Environment\nMost researchers today think that an environmental agent such as a virus or some chemical that randomly affects a genetically susceptible individual is likely to cause disease. Currently, the specific environmental factor has not been identified, but hypotheses are still being raised.\nThe environmental factors that can trigger lupus and cause flare-ups are not fully known, but the most common factors studied are ultraviolet rays (UVA and UVB); infection and exposure to silica dust in agricultural or industrial environments.\nOther examples of potential environmental triggers include:\nUltraviolet rays from the sun and/or fluorescent lights; Sulfamide drugs make a person more sensitive to sunlight.; Infection, cold or viral illness; Prolonged fatigue and exhaustion; Emotional stress, experiencing some events in life.",
