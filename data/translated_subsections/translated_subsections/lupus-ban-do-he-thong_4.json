    "subsection_content": "Currently, there is no single test that gives doctors a “yes” or “no” answer when diagnosing lupus erythematosus. Sometimes it can take months or even years to gather all the right information.\nDiagnosing lupus is like piecing together a puzzle. Your doctor will look at several different pieces of the puzzle: your symptoms, medical history, family history, and tests. If enough pieces come together, you may be diagnosed with lupus.\nIf your doctor thinks you might have lupus, he or she will ask you questions about your symptoms, such as:\nWhat are the symptoms you are experiencing?; When and where do these symptoms appear mainly?; Does anything make your symptoms better or worse?; Do these symptoms occur regularly? Do these symptoms ever come and go over a period of time?; Do your symptoms get worse at certain times of the day?; Do these symptoms seriously affect your daily activities and disrupt your routine?\nYour doctor may also ask if anyone in your family has lupus or another autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, reactive arthritis, etc. Because people who have family members with autoimmune diseases may be more susceptible to lupus.\nAccording to the American College of Rheumatology, there is a list of symptoms and other indicators that doctors can use as a guide to determine whether a patient has lupus. If your doctor finds that you have these symptoms, and finds no other cause, you may have lupus:\nRash: A butterfly-shaped rash appears on the cheeks. A papular or discoid rash appears (discoid lupus erythematosus). A rash appears on the skin when exposed to sunlight; A butterfly-shaped rash appears on the cheeks; Appearance of papular or discoid erythema (discoid lupus erythematosus); A rash appears on the skin when exposed to sunlight; Mouth ulcers: ulcers in the mouth or nose that last from a few days to more than a month; Arthritis: Joints are susceptible to damage and swelling and pain lasting several weeks in two or more joints; Pleural effusion or pericardial effusion: pleurisy, or pericarditis appears. Patients may feel chest pain and difficulty breathing when taking deep breaths.; Kidney problems: Urine tests show blood or protein mixed in, reduced kidney function; Neurological problems: Seizures, strokes or mental disorders; Tests show abnormal blood conditions: Cytopenia: results show that the patient has anemia, leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) give positive results: most patients with lupus erythematosus give positive results when doing this test. Certain antibodies that indicate an immune system problem: anti-double-stranded DNA (called anti-dsDNA), anti-Smith antibodies (called anti-Sm) or antiphospholipid antibodies, blood tests may give false positive results for syphilis.; Cytopenia: results show that the patient has anemia, leukopenia or thrombocytopenia.; Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) give positive results: most patients with lupus erythematosus give positive results when doing this test.; Certain antibodies that indicate an immune system problem: anti-double-stranded DNA (called anti-dsDNA), anti-Smith antibodies (called anti-Sm) or antiphospholipid antibodies, blood tests May give false positive results for syphilis.",
