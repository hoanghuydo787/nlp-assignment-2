    "subsection_content": "Currently, there is still no cure for lupus. However, due to improved diagnosis and management of the disease, most people with the disease will continue to live a normal life. The main treatment today is to treat symptoms, severity, and complications of the disease. Patients with muscle or joint pain, fatigue, rashes and other problems that are not dangerous can be treated with conventional treatment options such as:\n1. Use anti-inflammatory drugs and pain relievers\nAnti-inflammatory medications help relieve many of the symptoms of lupus by reducing inflammation and pain. These are the most common medications used to treat lupus symptoms such as fever, arthritis, or pleurisy. These symptoms usually improve within a few days after starting treatment. For many people with lupus, anti-inflammatory drugs may be the only medications they need to control their lupus. Some anti-inflammatory drugs include:\nAspirin\nHelps relieve pain with anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet properties. Some lupus symptoms can be controlled. However, the medicine can cause stomach irritation. Rarely used now.\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol®)\nUsed in pain relief treatment. Less stomach irritation than aspirin. Medications do not help reduce inflammation and cannot control lupus disease activity. Most people have no side effects from taking Tylenol. But, in some rare cases, liver problems have occurred.\n2. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\nIbuprofen (Motrin®), naproxen (Naprosyn®), indomethacin (Indocin®), nabumetone (Relafen®), and celecoxib (Celebrex®)\nHelps reduce inflammation, especially helpful for joint pain and stiffness. Like aspirin, NSAIDs can cause stomach irritation. NSAIDs can also cause serious gastrointestinal problems such as bleeding ulcers. To reduce the risk of these problems, the medication is often taken with food, milk, or antacids. They may also come with other medications such as misoprostol (Cytotec®), omeprazole (Prilosec®), lanzoprazole (Prevacid®), and others. You may need a prescription for these medications. You should always be careful when taking too much NSAID. This can reduce blood flow to your kidneys and may interfere with their ability to remove waste from your body.\nCorticosteroids\nCorticosteroids are medications that work like cortisol, a natural hormone produced by the adrenal glands. Cortisol helps regulate blood pressure and the immune system. It is also the body's most powerful anti-inflammatory hormone. Corticosteroids prescribed for autoimmune diseases are different from anabolic steroids.\nSteroid medications work quickly to reduce swelling, heat, tenderness, and pain associated with inflammation by dampening the immune system's response. Prednisone is the most commonly prescribed steroid for lupus. Your doctor will prescribe Prednisolone and methylprednisolone if you have liver problems.\n3. Anti-malarial drugs\nAntimalarials are prescription medications used along with steroids and other medications. They are used partly to reduce the required dosage of other medications. Anti-malarial drugs are often prescribed for fatigue, rash, joint pain or mouth ulcers. They may also help prevent abnormal blood clotting.\nAntimalarial drugs improve lupus by reducing antibody production. This protects against UV damage from the sun and other sources and improves skin damage.\nTwo antimalarial drugs commonly prescribed today for lupus are hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil®) and chloroquine (Aralen®).\nUnlike the quick response to taking steroids, it may take several months before malaria medications improve your lupus symptoms. Side effects from antimalarial drugs are rare and usually mild. These include abdominal pain and changes in skin color. Side effects usually disappear after the body adapts to the medication.\n4. Immunosuppressive drugs\nImmunosuppressants are prescription medications used to control inflammation and an overactive immune system. They are especially used when steroids cannot control lupus symptoms, or when a person cannot take high doses of steroids. However, there can be serious side effects from these medications.\nIf you are being treated with immunosuppressants, you should visit regularly for careful monitoring by your doctor. Immunosuppressants reduce the body's ability to fight infection. Therefore, they increase your chances of getting a viral infection like chickenpox… It is extremely important that you pay attention to even the smallest cut or wound and let your doctor know if there are any signs of infection what starts, such as redness, swelling or pain. These drugs may also increase your risk of developing certain types of cancer. Each immunosuppressant drug has unique side effects. Therefore, it is important that only doctors who have experience with these medications prescribe them. Because this disease affects so many parts of the body, some doctors who may be involved in its care and treatment include:\nRheumatologist, a specialist in the treatment of joint diseases and autoimmune diseases in general; Dermatologist.; Cardiologist.; Nephrologist.\nThe progression of lupus is different for each person. Today, with appropriate treatment, most people with lupus can live longer and have a much improved quality of life. Following your treatment plan and taking your medications as prescribed can help prevent symptoms from recurring.",
