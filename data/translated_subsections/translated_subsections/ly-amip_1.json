In other words, this is an important part of their life cycle.(2)\nThe main cause of amoebic dysentery is the parasite Entamoeba histolytica. This type of protozoa forms cysts and passes out into the environment in feces. When food or water containing Entamoeba histolytica cysts enters the digestive tract, the amoeba is immediately released and the infection begins. During the active phase, Entamoeba histolytica exists only in the host and fresh feces. On the contrary, cysts are always present in water, soil, and food, especially in humid conditions.\nWith a tough outer protective layer, this bacterial cyst can survive continuously for weeks, withstanding heat levels of up to 68 degrees Celsius for 5 minutes. In addition, Entamoeba histolytica is also resistant to certain chemicals. That is why amoebic dysentery is relatively difficult to control. Bacteria that attack the intestinal wall have the risk of causing serious damage. In many cases, it also enters the bloodstream, causing damage to the liver, lungs, brain and spleen.\nAnatomy of the bacterium Entamoeba histolytica",
