Patients may notice some of the following typical signs within 4 weeks of infection:\nStomach-ache; Diarrhea; Rectal bleeding; Fever; Loose stools; Nausea\nEntamoeba histolytica can exist in the intestine for a long time, even without showing obvious symptoms. Therefore, immediately after living or moving to an area with unsanitary conditions, the best solution is to get examined and tested for timely detection.\nTime to onset varies widely between cases, and asymptomatic infection lasts on average more than a year. The study hypothesized that this change in intensity could be due to the amoeba strain, the host's immune response, or the bacteria or viruses involved.\nDiarrhea is one of the common symptoms of amoebic dysentery",
