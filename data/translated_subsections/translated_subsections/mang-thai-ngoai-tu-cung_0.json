This condition can cause massive bleeding in the abdominal cavity and even threaten the life of the pregnant woman if not treated promptly.\nIn a normal pregnancy, fertilization occurs inside the fallopian tubes. The fertilized egg then enters the uterus and nests within the uterine lining. The embryo develops into a fetus and will remain inside the uterus until birth.\nIn cases where women have an ectopic pregnancy, the embryo will not be able to survive and develop normally, potentially leading to many serious consequences. Statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that this is the cause of 3-4% of pregnancy-related deaths. (first)",
