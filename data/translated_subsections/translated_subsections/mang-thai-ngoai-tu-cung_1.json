    "subsection_content": "In the early stages, pregnant women with ectopic pregnancies may have symptoms similar to normal pregnancy such as missed periods, breast tenderness, nausea or abdominal pain.\nHowever, an ectopic pregnancy will not be able to continue to develop like a normal pregnancy. Pregnant women may still have a positive result on a pregnancy test, but will experience some strange signs such as:\nAbnormal vaginal bleeding: Pregnant women may bleed before menstruation and last for many days (spotting). Bleeding is light, usually brown or black. In case blood leaks from the fallopian tubes (fallopian tubes), the pregnant woman may feel shoulder pain or have the urge to have a bowel movement. More specific symptoms will depend on the location of the hematoma and which nerves are irritated.; Pelvic pain: Ectopic pregnancy can cause lower abdominal pain and one-sided abdominal pain. The pain is usually dull, sometimes sharp.\n“If the fetus continues to grow, it can rupture, causing massive bleeding inside the pregnant woman's abdomen. In this case, pregnant women may experience sudden, severe abdominal pain, accompanied by dangerous symptoms such as shock, dizziness or fainting. This is an emergency and life-threatening condition, so pregnant women need to be taken to the hospital for immediate emergency treatment,\" Dr. Cao Thi Thuy Ha recommended.",
