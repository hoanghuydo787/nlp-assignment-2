In particular, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and salpingitis are two inflammatory conditions that greatly impact the risk of ectopic pregnancy in women.; Having sexually transmitted diseases: Some sexually transmitted infections (STDs) such as gonorrhea, chlamydia,...; Smoking: Smoking habits are also associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.; Being treated for infertility: Using ovulation stimulating drugs during infertility treatment can make you more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy.; Abnormalities in the fallopian tubes: These abnormalities can be congenital or surgical and will increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy.; Previous pelvic surgery: Caesarean section or fibroid removal surgery are also risk factors for this condition.; Using birth control pills or an intrauterine device (IUD): Using birth control methods may increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy.; Tubal ligation: Tubal ligation is a surgery performed to help women prevent unwanted pregnancy. However, this will also increase the rate of ectopic pregnancy if the woman later becomes pregnant.\nMisuse of birth control pills can increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy\nHowever, it should be noted that pregnant women can still have an ectopic pregnancy even though they do not have any of the above risk factors.
