It can be treated with medication, laparoscopic surgery or open abdominal surgery. (3)\nDrug treatment\nFor ectopic pregnancies that are detected early, are small in size (no more than 3cm in diameter) and have not ruptured, they are often treated with medication.\nThe most commonly used drug in this case is Methotrexate, which prevents cell division and growth, helping the fetus to self-dissolve after 4-6 weeks of treatment. Methotrexate will be administered by injection. After injection, pregnant women need to be monitored and HCG tested to determine the effectiveness of treatment. If the HCG test index is not as expected, the doctor may change the medication dose or perform surgical intervention depending on the specific case.\nDuring treatment, pregnant women may experience some side effects of the drug such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, depression, mouth ulcers, hair loss, diarrhea, vision problems... Some side effects Other rare side effects include pancreatic failure, liver failure, and kidney failure.\nAfter treatment, pregnant women need to avoid getting pregnant again for at least 3 months or longer according to the doctor's instructions and advice.\nSurgical treatment\nDepending on the specific case, the doctor will advise and instruct the pregnant woman to choose laparoscopic or open surgery to remove the ectopic pregnancy.\nEndoscopic surgery\nLaparoscopic surgery is applied in cases where the fetus is large in size but has not ruptured.

In salpingectomy, both the fetus and the fallopian tubes are removed.\nIt should be noted that women can still get pregnant even after having their fallopian tubes removed. In case both fallopian tubes are removed, in vitro fertilization (IVF) is the first choice to help women get pregnant and have children.\nOpen abdominal surgery\nIn cases where the ectopic pregnancy grows large and ruptures, causing serious internal bleeding, laparotomy surgery is required for treatment.
