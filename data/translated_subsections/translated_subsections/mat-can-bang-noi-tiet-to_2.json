In addition, living habits and environmental conditions also cause female hormone imbalance. Endocrine glands include cells located throughout the body that create, store, and release hormones into the blood. Different endocrine glands regulate different organs in the body. There are many causes of hormonal imbalance in women such as: (2)\nUnhealthy diet.; Too much stress causes stress; The body accumulates a lot of fat.; The pituitary gland has a tumor.; Diabetes.; Prader-Willi syndrome (rare disorder after birth, frequent feeling of hunger, this sign begins around 2 years of age).; Hereditary pancreatitis; Endocrine gland damage; Severe infection.; Toxins, pollutants, herbicides, pesticides.; Serious allergic reactions; Abuse of anabolic steroid drugs (increases protein in cells, stimulates muscle growth).; Only one active X chromosome (Turner syndrome causes heart and ovarian defects).; An overactive or ineffective thyroid gland; Phytoestrogen, estrogen from foods such as soybeans (too much estrogen can easily cause breast cancer, ovarian cancer, infertility, autoimmune disorders).; High glucagon levels (leading to diabetes-like symptoms).; High insulin levels in the body; Too much or too little parathyroid hormone to balance the amount of calcium in the blood).; Birth control pill.; Hormone replacement drugs.; Tumors or cysts are benign but also affect the endocrine glands.; Cancer.; Chemotherapy or radiotherapy.; Solitary thyroid nodules (non-fatal, including signs of nasopharyngeal cancer).; High levels of the hormone cortisol; Too little cortisol and aldosterone hormones (Addison's disease has many symptoms of female hormone imbalance such as: fatigue, sexual dysfunction).; Iodine deficiency.; Anorexia.; Medicine.; Ovarian cancer, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), premature menopause, hormone replacement drugs, birth control pills, premature ovarian insufficiency (POI – occurs when a woman's ovaries stop functioning normally before age 40, causing the body does not produce normal amounts of estrogen hormone or release eggs regularly, easily leading to infertility).",
