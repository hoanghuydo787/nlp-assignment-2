Therefore, endocrine disorders are difficult to diagnose, so doctors will ask patients to perform a number of tests such as:\nThe test evaluates the amount of hormones in the urine or blood, to determine whether the hormone level is increased or decreased. Depending on the type of hormone, the time of taking the test is very important to avoid falsifying the results.; Diagnostic imaging tests such as ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging will be prescribed by the doctor when there are hormone abnormalities. In some cases, no visual abnormalities are detected in the endocrine glands, but the amount of hormones secreted is greatly disturbed.",
