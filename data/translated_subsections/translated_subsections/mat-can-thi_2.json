    "subsection_content": "The eye acts as a converging lens. All images entering the eye will be presented in the retina. Finally, through receptor cells and optic nerves, it will help the brain recognize images similar to the outside world. However, in nearsighted people, the image of an object entering the eye will lie in front of the retina instead of on the retina, so distant objects will no longer be seen clearly.\nRisk factors and causes of myopia in the eyes:\nGenetics: children whose parents have astigmatism are more likely to be nearsighted. There are some cases where children whose parents are not nearsighted still become nearsighted. Doctors still don't understand why. Therefore, myopia has many causes and genetics is only one part.; Environment: lack of time participating in outdoor activities can increase the risk of myopia.; Prolonged close-up activities: prolonged reading or other close-up activities are associated with an increased risk of nearsightedness.; Prolonged use of electronic screens: children who use computers or smart devices for long periods of time have a higher risk of developing myopia.",
