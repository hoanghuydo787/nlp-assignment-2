This is when the tissue lining the back of the eye lifts or separates from the eye wall. Retinal detachment is a serious problem that can cause blindness. Therefore, patients must regularly go to the doctor to have their retinas checked. The more severe myopia, the higher the risk of retinal detachment. You need to see a doctor for early detection of warning signs of retinal detachment.; Glaucoma: disease that damages the eye's optic nerve. It usually occurs when fluid accumulates in the front part of the eye. This excess fluid increases pressure in the eye and damages the optic nerve. Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness in people over 60 years old. However, blindness from glaucoma can often be prevented with early treatment.; Cataract: when the eye's natural lens becomes cloudy. Proteins in the lens break down and cause things to look blurry or less colorful.",
