    "subsection_content": "Myopia treatment helps improve vision by focusing light on the retina through corrective glasses or refractive surgery. Management of myopia includes: regular monitoring for complications, glaucoma, cataracts and retinal detachment.\nEyeglasses: this is a simple, safe way to improve vision caused by nearsightedness. Spectacle lenses can also be designed to correct a combination of refractive errors such as nearsightedness, astigmatism and farsightedness.; Contact lenses: are small plastic discs placed directly on the cornea. One contact lens corrects many refractive errors. Glass comes in a variety of materials and requires careful maintenance. The doctor can recommend the most suitable contact lenses based on the examined condition and the patient's lifestyle.; Surgery: this method reduces the need to wear eyeglasses and contact lenses. Doctors use lasers to reshape the cornea. LASIK: the doctor creates a thin hinged flap into the cornea and uses a laser to remove corneal tissue to flatten the dome shape. Recovery from LASIK surgery is usually faster and less uncomfortable than other corneal surgeries. LASEK: the doctor only creates an ultra-thin flap in the outer protective layer of the cornea (epithelium). The doctor then uses a laser to reshape and flatten the curve of the cornea and replace the epithelium. PRK: This procedure is similar to LASEK, except the surgeon completely removes the epithelium, then uses a laser to reshape the cornea. Contact lenses temporarily cover the cornea to protect the eye until the epithelium grows back naturally and conforms to the cornea's new shape. SMILE: this method does not involve flaps or epithelial removal. Instead, the doctor uses a laser to cut a small disc-shaped piece of cornea. It is then removed through a small corneal incision.; LASIK: the doctor creates a thin hinged flap into the cornea and uses a laser to remove corneal tissue to flatten the dome shape.

Furthermore, atropine eye drops may also help slow the progression of myopia.; Increase time spent outdoors: Spending time outdoors during childhood, adolescence and early adulthood may reduce the risk of developing nearsightedness.; Dual focus contact lenses: a type of dual focus contact lens that has shown some effect in slowing the progression of myopia.; Corneal reshaping: hard contact lenses worn at night temporarily reshape the cornea. Glasses should not be worn during the day. Studies have shown that this therapy can slow the progression of myopia.\nEat healthy foods to protect your eyes and prevent nearsightedness.",
