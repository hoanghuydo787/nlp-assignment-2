    "subsection_content": "The parts of the eye work together like a relay team to transmit light into the eye. Light passes through the cornea, the cornea focuses the light through the lens into a signal that is transmitted to the retina - the layer at the back of the eyeball. The retina converts that light into electrical signals that the optic nerve sends to the brain. The brain uses those signals to create images for humans to see.\nHowever, in people with astigmatism, light entering the eye is bent more than normal. Light cannot focus properly on the retina. Uneven focus makes objects look blurry or wavy. Patients may experience eye strain as if their eyes are working too hard to see the surrounding images. Therefore, astigmatism can affect vision at any distance, including near and far.",
