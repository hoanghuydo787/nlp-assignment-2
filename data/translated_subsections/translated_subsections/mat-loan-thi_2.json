Diopters are a unit of measurement for the optical power of a lens. A higher number of diopters means the patient's vision is poorer or needs more correction.\nThe severity of astigmatism correlates with the number of diopters [2]:\nMild astigmatism: less than 1.00 diopters; Moderate astigmatism: 1.00 – 2.00 diopters; Severe astigmatism: 2.00 – 3.00 diopters; Very severe astigmatism: more than 3.00 diopters.\nTo determine whether the patient has astigmatism or not, the doctor will conduct a comprehensive eye examination. The doctor will also ask the person about any changes in vision. This can help your doctor see if your symptoms are related to astigmatism.",
