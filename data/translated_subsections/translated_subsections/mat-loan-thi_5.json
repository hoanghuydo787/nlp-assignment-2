    "subsection_content": "Astigmatism can cause complications if left untreated. For example, strabismus occurs when a patient has astigmatism in one eye or the astigmatism in one eye is worse than the other eye and this condition persists without treatment. Furthermore, astigmatism causes eye strain and headaches.\nSurgery to treat astigmatism also has risks. Side effects from surgery are usually temporary and improve within a few weeks. The condition often causes dry eyes, sensitivity to light, and problems with night vision.\nIn addition, other and more long-term complications can also occur such as loss of vision or vision returning to its pre-operative state.",
