Vision correction surgery includes LASIK eye surgery, photokeratectomy or PRK eye surgery using lasers to correct vision problems. A specialist will perform procedures to change the shape of the cornea, helping light shine properly on the retina.\nIn addition, patients with cataracts and astigmatism are also treated at the same time during cataract surgery.",
