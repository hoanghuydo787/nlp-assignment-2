Doctors diagnose astigmatism through an eye exam by looking into the eye (including inside the eye).\nDoctors use a number of tests to diagnose astigmatism, including:\nVision test: this is an eye test; The patient performs the test by looking at a wall chart of letters or symbols.; Refraction test: the doctor will measure the amount of light focused and bent when entering the eye.; Corneal map: the doctor will measure the patient's corneal curve. This technology provides the most detailed information about the patient's cornea shape. The doctor tells the patient to look at a specific spot and the device collects thousands of tiny measurements. Computer constructs corneal color map from data.; Slit lamp: is a special type of microscope that shines bright light into the eye. The doctor adjusts the brightness and thickness of the light beam to see different layers and parts of the eye.",
