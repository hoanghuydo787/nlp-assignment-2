    "subsection_content": "Eyeglasses or contact lenses correct most cases of astigmatism.\nIf the patient has very mild astigmatism (does not affect vision), there is no need to wear glasses or contact lenses. Your doctor will measure any changes in your eyes at each visit.; If the patient has a normal level of astigmatism, the patient must have lens correction such as glasses, contact lenses or surgery.\nAstigmatism changes over time and gets worse. Therefore, patients need to wear glasses or contact lenses even when they do not need them.\n1. Eyeglasses\nThe doctor will carefully examine the eyes to find the right type of eyeglasses for the patient. These can be bifocals or progressive lenses, depending on the patient's vision problem. Eyeglass lenses are curved to counteract the shape of the cornea or lens that causes blurred vision. Eyeglass lenses work well when looking straight ahead.\nBut depending on the level of the patient, the glasses need to be adjusted because sometimes the eyes feel that the floor or wall is tilted. This effect will disappear once the eyes have adapted to the glasses. The patient starts wearing glasses in the morning, for a few hours at a time, and adjusts slowly. If your vision does not improve, see your doctor for adjustment.\nAdvantages: cheaper cost than other treatment methods; Disadvantages: can be lost or damaged, broken and broken.\n2. Contact lenses\nThese are thin plastic or glass lenses that fit over the eye's cornea and correct vision.\nSoft contact lenses: Soft lenses used for astigmatism are toric lenses.; Rigid contact lenses: Rigid gas-permeable contact lenses are a good choice when the patient's astigmatism is severe. Doctors use this type for certain procedures called orthokeratology.\nPatients wearing glasses while sleeping will reshape the cornea. Patients need to wear contact lenses to maintain this new shape but do not need to wear them regularly.\nAdvantages: Choice of soft or hard lenses. Good choice for active people; Choose from soft or hard lenses.; Good choice for active people; Disadvantages: Maybe not suitable for everyone.

Surgery\nIncludes LASIK eye surgery, photokeratectomy, and PRK eye surgery. PRK removes tissue from the outer and inner layers of the cornea. LASIK only removes tissue from the inner layer of the cornea. If a patient has astigmatism, there are many options to correct the vision problem. You should consult your doctor to choose the treatment method that best meets your visual needs and lifestyle.\nAdvantage:; The effect is sometimes permanent.
