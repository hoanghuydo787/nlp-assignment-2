Because the blue light from these devices can make it harder for you to sleep.; Avoid caffeine, nicotine and alcohol late in the day.; Exercise regularly; Do not eat too many meals at the end of the day or overeat in the evening.; Make the bedroom space comfortable: Dark, quiet and not too warm or too cold.; Practice a relaxing routine before going to bed such as reading a book, listening to music, taking a bath, or meditating, etc.; The bed should not be used for anything other than sleep and sex.; If you can't fall asleep and aren't sleepy, get up and do something calming, such as reading a book until you feel sleepy.; If you tend to lie awake and worry about things, make a to-do list before bed. This can help you put your concerns aside and relax before bed.",
