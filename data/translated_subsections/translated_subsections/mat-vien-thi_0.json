Patients with farsightedness will often have an easier time seeing objects that are farther away (at least 6 meters or nearly 20 steps) but have difficulty seeing objects that are close. People with severe farsightedness may have blurred vision when seeing things around them, even at any distance.\nFarsightedness tends to run in families. Doctors can help patients correct the condition by measuring and recommending appropriate eyeglasses, contact lenses or surgery.",
