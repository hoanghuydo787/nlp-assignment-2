    "subsection_content": "To see clearly, light rays must pass through the front of the eye (cornea and lens). Then, the cornea and lens work together to bring light into the retina (back layer of the eye). The retina sends signals to the brain allowing people to see.\nHowever, for people with farsightedness, light entering the eye will shine behind the retina instead of entering the correct retina. This causes light rays to focus behind the retina, or in other words, distant objects appear clearly while near objects appear blurry.\nMost children are farsighted but their vision is not blurry. With mild farsightedness, most children see clearly both near and far. As you grow older, your eyes will develop and mild farsightedness will decrease or disappear completely.",
