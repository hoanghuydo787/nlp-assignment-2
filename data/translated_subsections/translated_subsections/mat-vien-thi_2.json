But if the parents are not farsighted, the child is still likely to be farsighted. Common causes of farsightedness in the eyes include:\nShort eyeballs: patients have relatively short eyeballs (from front to back). Doctors often call this condition “decreased axial length”; Flat cornea: the patient has a flatter cornea than expected.\nThe cornea is the transparent outer layer of the eye that bends light entering the eye and helps it reach the retina - a thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye. A slightly curved cornea bends light entering the eye at the right angle to reach the retina.\nBut if the cornea is too flat or the distance between the front and back eyes is too short, it will be imbalanced. As a result, light enters the eye but does not reach the target of the retina. The light rays are not focused but stay behind the retina, making nearby objects look blurry. Sometimes, other parts of the eye can be adjusted to help see clearly, but with higher levels of farsightedness, the eye needs the help of glasses or other methods to focus.\nEye anatomy",
