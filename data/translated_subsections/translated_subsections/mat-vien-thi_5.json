    "subsection_content": "Farsightedness is diagnosed with a basic eye exam that includes:\nVision test: the doctor asks to read a chart in the room. If the test shows farsightedness, the doctor uses a retinoscope to see the light reflected from the patient's retina. In addition, doctors also use a phoropter – a testing device to help decide the best prescription for glasses or contact lenses.; Refraction test: to determine whether the patient has vision problems such as nearsightedness, farsightedness or astigmatism. The doctor uses different instruments and asks the patient to look through several lenses to test near and far vision. In addition, the doctor will put drops in the eyes, dilating the pupils to check eye health. This makes the patient's eyes more sensitive to light for several hours after the examination, allowing the doctor to see wider angles inside the patient's eyes.; Keratometry: This method supports the diagnosis and treatment regimen for corneal diseases such as refractive errors and keratoconus. This is a useful method for planning appropriate treatments such as eyeglasses, contact lenses, and surgery. In addition, this is also a way to evaluate changes over time in the corneal surface.; Slit lamp: this is a comprehensive eye exam. The patient sits in a chair facing the light slit, with his chin and forehead resting on the support column. The doctor will use this instrument to observe details of the eye and determine if there are any abnormalities. The doctor can discuss the results with the patient immediately.",
