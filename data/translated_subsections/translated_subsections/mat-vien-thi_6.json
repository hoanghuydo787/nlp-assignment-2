    "subsection_content": "1. Eyeglasses\nThe lenses in eyeglasses help correct presbyopia by changing the way light focuses on the retina. This helps improve vision caused by farsightedness. There are a variety of lens types including monofocal, bifocal, trifocal and progressive multifocal. The degree of farsightedness determines the type of lenses the patient needs and how often they should wear them. [3]\n2. Contact lenses\nContact lenses work like eyeglasses. Glasses will correct the bending of light as it enters the eye. But the contact points are smaller than the lenses in glasses and are located right on the surface of the eyeball. The glasses come in a variety of materials and styles including soft and hard, gas permeable, combined with spherical, toric, multifocal and single-angle designs. Contact lenses are safe, comfortable and convenient but can cause dry eyes and eye infections.\n3. Surgery\nThese surgical procedures correct farsightedness by reshaping the curvature of the cornea. Surgical methods include [4]:\nLaser assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK): the doctor creates a thin, hinged flap into the cornea. Then, a laser is used to correct the curves of the cornea to help correct presbyopia. Recovery from LASIK surgery is usually faster and less difficult than other corneal surgeries.; Laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK): the doctor creates an ultrathin flap in just the outer protective layer of the cornea (the epithelium). The doctor then uses a laser to reshape the outer layers of the cornea, changing its curve and then replacing the epithelium.; Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK): This procedure is similar to LASEK, except the surgeon completely removes the epithelium and then uses a laser to reshape the cornea. The epithelium is not replaced but grows back naturally, conforming to the new shape of the cornea.\nThe lenses in eyeglasses help correct farsightedness.",
