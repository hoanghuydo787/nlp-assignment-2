    "subsection_content": "There are 2 types of hives:\n1. Acute urticaria:\nThe rash lasts less than 6 weeks. The disease appears suddenly, the nodules can concentrate in some areas of the skin or spread throughout the body. 10% of cases of acute urticaria cause angioedema (swelling deep inside the skin in the skin mucosa, causing the skin to turn red and swollen) causing itching and pain. If treated properly, angioedema will improve after 72 hours.; In general, people with acute urticaria, if treated and cared for properly, will soon improve. However, many patients subjectively do not seek treatment, allowing the damage to persist and turn into a chronic stage.\n2. Chronic urticaria:\nSkin damage lasting more than 6 weeks, characterized by rash, itchy pink, red or pale white papules on the skin. Patients experience itching, burning, and discomfort. Chronic urticaria, in addition to causing damage to the skin, also seriously affects health, spirit and quality of life.; However, chronic urticaria persists and recurs continuously, causing changes in skin color (pigmented urticaria), affecting daily activities, sleep, and appearance, causing patients to have low self-esteem. next.; Chronic urticaria often responds poorly to treatment solutions. Although the disease is not immediately dangerous, if not properly cared for and treated, it can easily cause complications: eczema, increased skin pigmentation (darkening of the skin) and increases the risk of other allergic diseases. In addition, chronic urticaria can affect the respiratory and digestive organs leading to difficulty breathing, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea...\nUrticaria is a skin rash, characterized by itchy bumps.",
