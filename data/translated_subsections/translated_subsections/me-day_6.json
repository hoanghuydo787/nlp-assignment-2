    "subsection_content": "Urticaria can be diagnosed through common symptoms. When admitting the patient, the doctor will ask about medical history, examine symptoms to find the cause of hives. In many cases, doctors prescribe some skin tests and blood tests to determine what the patient is allergic to; In addition, during the process of reviewing the medical history, the doctor will determine whether the patient has acute or chronic urticaria to order appropriate tests.; In particular, at Tam Anh General Hospital Testing Center in Ho Chi Minh City, there is a testing service for 60 allergens to help patients find the cause of hives. IgE antibodies in the blood will determine the level and severity of urticaria. Quantitative testing of IgE levels helps monitor treatment progress (Immunoglobulin E is one of five types of immunoglobulins: IgM, IgG, IgD, IgA and IgE).\nWith chronic urticaria, testing procedures are performed to find the cause. This is very important because eliminating the cause is a prerequisite for treatment. 80% of people with chronic urticaria find common causes such as: autonomic reactions, infections, and intolerance. Patients with chronic urticaria have a major impact on their quality of life, with a 20%-30% reduction in work performance.\n1. Clinical diagnosis\nIn clinical diagnosis, the doctor directly examines the patient by asking questions related to health status, family factors, lifestyle, home environment, and work environment. The doctor also performs basic activities of looking, touching... thereby detecting abnormalities. The eyelids, genitals, lips... are sensitive so hives easily appear. Red spots can cause swelling of the entire skin area (angioedema). If there is angioedema in the larynx or digestive tract, the patient will have difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, diarrhea...\n2. Paraclinical diagnosis\nMost urticaria is diagnosed through a clinical examination. Paraclinical help find the cause of urticaria. In particular, the blood test is to determine the amount of eosinophils (related to parasitic infection and allergy level). In case, if the doctor suspects it is due to pollen, dust mites... he will do a test to find allergens.\nThis is the basic technique of diagnosing allergens that cause allergies by searching for IgE (one of 5 types of immunoglobulins: hIgM, IgG, IgD, IgA and IgE) specifically on the skin through an antigen-antibody reaction that resolves the problem. release mast cells (immune cells found in the space between mucosal tissues, epithelium and the external environment).",
