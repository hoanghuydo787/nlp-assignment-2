Doctors prescribe histamine to reduce the symptoms of inflammation. With chronic urticaria, patients are treated with antihistamines or a combination of drugs.\nIf antihistamines do not help the patient reduce pain and itching, the doctor will prescribe oral/injectable steroids. In cases where the above medications are not effective, biological medications may be used to control urticaria.\nThe biologic drug approved for the treatment of urticaria is omalizumab, which blocks immunoglobulin E. It can reduce symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria, a type of urticaria of unknown cause.
