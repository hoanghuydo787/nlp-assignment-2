However, high liver enzyme levels do not always indicate liver damage or serious disease.\nElevated liver enzymes are often a warning sign of liver inflammation or damage\nSometimes, factors such as hormonal changes or reactions to medications can temporarily increase liver enzyme levels. Elevated levels caused by these factors will usually return to normal in about 2 to 4 weeks without treatment.\nCommon liver enzymes include:\n–  Alanine transaminase (ALT)\n– Aspartate transaminase (AST)\n– Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)\n– Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)\nElevated liver enzymes are often a warning sign of inflammation or damage to liver cells such as: Hepatitis or liver diseases. Accordingly,  when liver cells are inflamed or damaged, they release liver enzymes into the blood, at higher levels than normal, increasing liver enzymes in blood tests.\nHigh liver enzymes can be detected during routine blood tests. In most cases, liver enzyme levels are only slightly and temporarily increased. Elevated liver enzymes are also not a sign of a serious, chronic liver problem.",
