Accordingly, normal indexes are determined as follows:\n– ALT (or GPT) less than or equal to 35 UI/l (for men) and less than or equal to 25 UI/l (for women)\n– AST (or GOT) less than or equal to 35 UI/l (for men) and less than or equal to 25 UI/l (for women)\n– GGT from 5-60 UI/l\n– ALP from 35-115 UI/l\nIncreased liver enzymes more or less do not reflect the severity of liver damage, but increased liver enzymes mean our liver is having problems. Therefore, when someone takes a test and finds high liver enzymes, they should see a doctor and promptly get advice on examination and treatment.",
