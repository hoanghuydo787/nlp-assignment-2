    "subsection_content": "1. Itchy skin\nItching is a symptom of chronic liver disease, which can be caused by elevated liver enzymes, but not everyone with elevated liver enzymes develops this disease. It must be distinguished from itching due to allergic mechanisms, which are very common in people without liver disease. (3)\nYou may have itching in your lower arms or it may be itchy all over your body. If it itches a little and goes away soon, there's no need to worry. However, constant itching can interfere with sleep and lead to a variety of other problems. When itching occurs, it is also a serious health concern.\nItching is one of the symptoms of high liver enzymes.\n2. Digestive disorders\nPeople with high liver enzymes leading to cirrhosis often have some characteristics of digestive dysfunction, causing serious impacts on the patient's nutritional status, quality of life and health.\nCommon symptoms of digestive disorders in people with high liver enzymes may be related to factors and severity of liver disease, leading to a decrease in daily food intake, contributing to the deterioration of nutritional status in the patient. cirrhosis.\n3. Jaundice\nJaundice occurs when there is too much bilirubin (a yellow pigment) in the blood – a condition called hyperbilirubinemia. In patients with hyperbilirubinemia, abnormally high liver enzyme levels must be differentiated from liver damage due to cholestasis. Jaundice can indicate a serious underlying condition so prompt diagnosis is essential. Rapid determination of the cause relies on taking an appropriate history, physical examination, and interpretation of serum and biochemical tests. Liver biochemical results will indicate whether jaundice is related to elevated liver enzymes and intrinsic liver diseases.\n4. Stool is light yellow\nLight yellow stools can be a sign of liver problems, related to elevated liver enzymes. Normal stools vary in brown color, mainly due to your diet. If your stool is pale yellow or clay-colored, we are likely having problems with the biliary system, including: gallbladder, liver and pancreas.\nThe liver releases bile salts into the stool, making the stool brown. In cases where the liver does not produce enough bile, or the flow of bile is obstructed and cannot exit the liver, the stool color may become pale.\nOccasional light yellow stools may not be a cause for concern. But if it happens often, you could have a dangerous liver disease. At this time, you need to see a specialist for advice and treatment.",
