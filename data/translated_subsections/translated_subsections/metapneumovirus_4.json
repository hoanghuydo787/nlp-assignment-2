Your doctor may then order tests to determine the specific cause of your condition. Performing testing will help detect the virus early, thereby supporting the process of diagnosis, prognosis and establishing appropriate and effective treatment regimens.\nTo perform this method, the doctor may perform a bronchoscopy and take a sample of secretions from the patient's nose or throat. The fluid sample will be tested for rapid antigen or PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing.\n“Currently, at Tam Anh General Hospital, Panel 2 testing for respiratory allergens is often performed to detect viruses that cause respiratory diseases, including Metapneumovirus.
