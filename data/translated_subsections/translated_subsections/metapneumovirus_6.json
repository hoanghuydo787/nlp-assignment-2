However, in some severe cases the disease can cause complications such as:\nBronchopneumonia;; Severe pneumonia causing respiratory failure;; Bronchiolitis.\nThese complications are often at higher risk in people with underlying medical conditions. For example, in patients with underlying bronchial asthma, when infected with Metapneumovirus, the disease can trigger acute asthma attacks of varying severity, threatening the patient's life.",
