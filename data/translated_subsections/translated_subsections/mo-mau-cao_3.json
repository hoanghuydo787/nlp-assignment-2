    "subsection_content": "According to Dr. Anh Thu, high blood fat will lead to the accumulation and formation of plaque inside blood vessels over time, called atherosclerosis. The longer it is left untreated, the larger the plaque will become, leading to narrowed or clogged blood vessels. People with atherosclerosis face a higher risk of developing a variety of conditions, depending on which blood vessels are blocked.\n1. Coronary artery disease\nCoronary artery disease, also known as ischemic heart disease or ischemic heart disease, can lead to a heart attack or heart failure. Coronary artery disease is the most common form of heart disease in the United States and the leading cause of death. Coronary arteries are blood vessels that supply blood to the heart and when the heart does not receive enough blood due to atherosclerosis, the heart will weaken and stop working.\nCoronary artery disease can affect even young people. In fact, about one-fifth of people who die from coronary heart disease are under the age of 65. That's why cholesterol testing should start at a young age and is considered so important. Because plaque can silently build up in the coronary arteries over time, many young people don't realize it's happening until they have chest pain (angina) or another sign of a heart attack. .\n2. Carotid artery disease\nThe carotid arteries carry blood from the heart to the brain. Carotid artery disease occurs when plaque narrows these arteries, preventing the brain from receiving enough oxygen-rich blood, which can lead to a transient ischemic attack or stroke.\n3. Peripheral artery disease\nWhen atherosclerosis affects the arteries in the legs or arms, it is called peripheral artery disease (PAD). The arteries in the legs and arms are called “peripheral” because they are far from the heart and center of the body. PAD is more common in the legs but can also occur in the arms.\nPAD is usually asymptomatic and symptoms may only begin to appear when the peripheral arteries are at least 60% blocked. The patient feels pain, fatigue or weakness in the legs, which occurs when moving and reduces when resting (also known as intermittent claudication). It's a sign of reduced blood flow due to growing plaque in the arteries.\nPAD can cause serious problems in the legs and feet as well as elsewhere in the body. That's because all the blood vessels are connected through the cardiovascular system and so plaque builds up in one area but slows down the entire network of blood vessels.\n4. Increased blood pressure\nHigh blood pressure and high blood fat are related to each other. Cholesterol and calcium plaque cause the arteries to become stiff and narrow. Therefore, the heart has to endure high pressure to pump blood through the arteries, resulting in blood pressure rising too high.\nThese are two of the biggest causes of heart disease.\nIn the United States, about 1 in 3 adults has high blood pressure and about 1 in 3 adults has high blood fats. More than half of the adults in each group had no control over their condition. This means the treatment is not thorough or the patient does not use any treatment.",
