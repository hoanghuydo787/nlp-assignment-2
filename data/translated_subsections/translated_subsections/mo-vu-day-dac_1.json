Dense breast tissue makes it difficult to see cancer on mammograms\nDense breast tissue (fibrous and glandular) appears white on a mammogram. Tumors and cancers are also white. So, dense tissues can make them more difficult to see. In contrast, fatty tissue looks almost black on a mammogram, so it's easier to see a white lump if most of the breast is fatty tissue. [first]\n2. Women with dense breast tissue have a higher risk of breast cancer\nIt is still unclear why breast tissue thickening is associated with breast cancer risk. It may be because dense breast tissue has more cells, which develop into abnormal cells. [2]\nDense breast tissue appears white on a mammogram.",
