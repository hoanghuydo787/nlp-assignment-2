    "subsection_content": "The doctor analyzing your mammogram will determine the ratio of non-dense tissue to dense tissue and prescribe the degree of breast density.\nThe degree of attenuation was described using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). The degree of breast tissue density is often recorded by letters:\nA – Almost entirely adipose tissue: the breast is almost entirely adipose tissue. About 1 in 10 women have this result.; B – Scattered fibrous breast tissue: scattered areas of fibroglandular density but most of the breast tissue is not dense. About 4 in 10 women have this result.; C – Heterogeneous dense breast tissue: density is not uniform, most breast tissue is dense. About 4 in 10 women have this result.; D – Extremely dense breast tissue: extremely dense indicates that nearly all of the breast tissue is dense. About 1 in 10 women have this result.\nIn short, women with breasts classified as type C or D are considered to have dense breast tissue. Half of women who have mammograms have dense breasts.\nDense breast tissue increases the risk of breast cancer.",
