    "subsection_content": "There is some evidence that additional tests may increase the likelihood of detecting cancer in dense breast tissue [3]. Additional breast cancer screening tests include:\n3-D mammogram: Tomosynthesis uses X-rays to collect multiple images of the breast from many angles. The images are synthesized by a computer into a 3-dimensional image. Mammography centers are transitioning to incorporate 3D mammography as part of standard mammography technology.\nAdvantage:; It is estimated that about 1 additional cancer per 1,000 women is detected.; Done at the same time as a standard mammogram.; Reduces the need for additional examination of non-cancerous areas of concern.; Useful in evaluating dense breast tissue.; Cons: Exposure to additional radiation, although levels are still low.\nBreast MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): uses magnets to create images of the breast. MRI does not use radiation. Women at high risk of breast cancer, who have genetic mutations that increase the risk of cancer, are recommended to have a breast MRI.\nAdvantages: An estimated 14 additional cancers are detected per 1,000 women. No additional radiation exposure. Popular.; An estimated 14 additional cancers per 1,000 women were detected.; No additional radiation exposure.; Popular.; Cons: Likely to find areas of concern that aren't cancerous, but require additional imaging or a biopsy. Request contrast injection. The test is expensive and may not be covered by insurance unless there is a high risk of cancer.; Potentially finding areas of concern that are not cancerous, but require additional imaging or a biopsy.; Request injection of contrast material.; The test is expensive and may not be covered by insurance unless there is a high risk of cancer.\nBreast ultrasound: uses sound waves to analyze tissue in suspicious areas on a mammogram.\nAdvantages: Estimated to detect 2 - 4 more cancers per 1,000 women. No additional radiation exposure. Popular.; It is estimated that 2 - 4 more cancers will be detected per 1,000 women.; No additional radiation exposure.; Popular.\nCons: Likely to find areas of concern that aren't cancerous, but require additional scans or biopsies.
