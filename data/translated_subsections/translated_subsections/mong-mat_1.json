According to the World Health Organization (WHO)\nGrade 1 – Pterygium extends to the edge of the cornea.; Grade 2 – Pterygium extends to between the edge of the cornea and the edge of the pupil.; Grade 3 – Pterygium invades the pupil edge; Grade 4 – Pterygium invades and covers the pupil.\n2. According to the degree of invasion into the cornea\nRelative to the center of the cornea, pterygium in the eye has 3 levels:\nGrade 1 (<2mm),.; Grade 2 (2 – 4mm).; Grade 3 (> 4mm).\n3. According to anatomy\nBased on the radius of the cornea, pterygium in the eye has the following 4 levels:\nGrade 1 – The pterygoid tip extends through the corneal limbus.; Grade 2 – The pterygoid tip is less than 1/2 of the corneal radius.; Grade 3 – The pterygoid tip extends beyond 1/2 of the corneal radius.; Grade 4 – The pterygium encroaches on the pupil.\n4. According to the level of prognosis\nBased on prognosis, pterygium in the eye has 2 types:\nProgressive pterygium has a serrated head, thick body, many blood vessels and easily recurs after surgery.; Fibrous pterygium has a round head, solid white color, does not progress and rarely recurs.",
