    "subsection_content": "Pterygium in the eye in the early stages does not affect vision but is not aesthetically pleasing. Symptoms in the early stages may include irritation, itching or burning, which patients can use eye drops to treat. Patients should avoid exposure to sunlight and wind to reduce stimulation of larger pterygium development. Small pterygium that stops growing is relatively harmless and may not require further treatment. [4]\nHowever, in some cases, pterygium can develop and obstruct vision or distort the shape of the cornea and cause blurred vision (astigmatism). In this case, surgery is recommended.\nPterygium is not cancerous – a benign tumor. Therefore, pterygium only develops locally, only affects vision and does not spread to other parts of the body. However, go to the hospital for an examination to rule out serious diseases, such as conjunctival or iris tumors.",
