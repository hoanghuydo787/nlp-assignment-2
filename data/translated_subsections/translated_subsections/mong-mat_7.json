Additionally, your doctor may need additional tests such as:\nVision test: Check the patient's vision to see whether the letters or symbols on the chart are 6 meters away; Evaluate corneal shape: Use a computer to create a 3D map to take a panoramic view of the cornea to detect abnormalities.\nThe doctor may take pictures of the patient's eyes to monitor changes in the development of the pterygium over time. Additionally, other tests may be ordered to rule out other conditions, such as cancers affecting the eyes.\nMaster Doctor Pham Huy Vu Tung, Ophthalmology specialist, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City",
