    "subsection_content": "Treatment will depend on the severity of the individual condition. Treatment methods for pterygium in the eye (cloud pulling) include:\n1. Eye drops\nEye drops are often used to treat mild irritation and soothe the cornea. For severe conditions, an ophthalmologist may prescribe steroid eye drops for a short time and must be prescribed in small doses and frequency by the doctor. This medication only relieves symptoms and is not a cure.\n2. Surgery\nSurgery is the only treatment that can remove pterygium. Pterygium should be removed before the disease develops on the cornea. Pterygium in the eye, when spreading to the cornea, can cause corneal scarring and permanently affect vision.\n3. Protection against ultraviolet radiation\nIf the pterygium is small, painless and does not cause vision problems, the patient should wear a hat and sunglasses when exposed to outdoor sunlight. Protecting the eyes from UV radiation will prevent the development of pterygium. In addition, patients can use sunglasses to help shield their eyes from ultraviolet rays entering the eyes.",
