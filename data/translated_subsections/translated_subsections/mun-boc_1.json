    "subsection_content": "Cystic acne is manifested as red, hard, swollen pimples around the pimples, with yellow or white fluid and pus inside the pimples, painful to the touch, easy to break and leave long-lasting dark spots.\nAcne is classified according to mild, moderate or severe severity. In addition, acne is also classified according to the nature and morphology of acne, including:\n1. Acne has a nucleus\nCystic acne often appears in large clumps, without white heads; feels hard and painful to the touch. Acne is located deep in the skin and hair follicles, so treatment time is longer than other acne. If treated incorrectly, acne will spread to the surrounding skin and easily recur.\n2. Cysts without cores\nIn contrast to cystic acne, cystic acne without a nucleus has the shape of a large lump, without a white tip; hard, rough and painful to the touch, especially when the acne is swollen. In fact, this type of acne has a core but is located deep under the skin and hair follicles, making it difficult to treat.\n3. Acne is calloused\nWhen acne is not completely removed, it will hide deep under the skin, causing hardened acne. Easily visible signs are dry, hard acne cores and black pimples; causes uneven skin tone and loss of aesthetics.\n4. Acne with pus\nThe cause is due to bacterial colonies forming on skin that is in a state of severe inflammation. At first it was just a hard nodule, then it swelled with pain. When a pimple bursts, the secretions include pus and blood. This type of acne easily leaves dark spots and pitted scars.\n5. Acne has fluid\nAcne is characterized by the presence of fluid inside, including pus and blood. Vesicles often appear on the eyelids, around the mouth, lips, lips, etc., causing redness, swelling, pain, and itching.\n6. Acne with blood\nThe easily recognizable shape is large round pimples, containing pus and blood inside, with a round white pus tip. Acne with blood is common during puberty. When acne bursts, if not treated properly, it can spread to the surrounding skin, causing new acne to grow, and the acne skin condition becomes even more serious.\n7. Whitehead acne\nWhitehead acne is quite similar to milk acne in young children, often growing in T-zone locations such as the forehead, nose, cheeks, chin; back, shoulders... Acne forms from a reaction between bacteria and immune cells surrounded by red, inflamed tissue. Occurs at all ages. Acne that lasts for a long time will form acne.",
