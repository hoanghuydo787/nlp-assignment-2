Just like squeezing acne, peeling acne helps remove acne from the surface of the skin. You can peel off pimples, but you need to use safe acne peeling gel products, clean your skin, and manipulate gently so that your skin is not damaged. However, with this method of removing bran acne, it is difficult to remove deep acne cores. At the same time, any impact on the skin will make acne worse. Popping pimples can cause a number of problems:\nDamaged skin: due to too strong force of peeling acne, sometimes leaving pitted scars; Skin irritation: some ingredients in acne peeling gels and acne peeling pads cause itching, burning, and swelling of the skin. The force of pulling the peel off the skin causes the acne to pop out and also causes damage to the skin surface.; Enlarged pores: Frequently peeling acne causes pores to continuously expand, with poor elasticity, leaving large pores, causing acne to recur and become more serious. Peeling acne also makes the skin dark and less sharp.; Dermatitis: peeling acne causes large pores, which is an opportunity for bacteria to attack, not only making the skin dark and less sharp, but also causing skin inflammation, leading to pustules.\n3. What should I do after squeezing acne?\nSqueezing pimples is to remove the pimples from the skin but at the same time create an open wound; If not cared for properly, the skin will be seriously damaged. Therefore, skin care regimen after squeezing acne is very important. To quickly recover your skin and prevent acne from returning, you should:\nDisinfect skin before and after squeezing acne; Use rose water to apply on the skin, massage gently to tighten pores, provide nutrients to the skin.; Using a mask helps the skin recover and heal damage quickly.; Apply acne medications as prescribed by a dermatologist.; Use sunscreen and protect your skin thoroughly when going out.\n4. Will acne go away on its own?\nAcne is unsightly but is usually benign and will mostly go away on its own if you know how to care for your skin properly. You should clean your skin and regularly exfoliate with safe products. However, in many cases, despite proper skin care and scientific diet, the skin still secretes a lot of oil, causing acne. Therefore, you should see a dermatologist for advice and appropriate treatment.\nProper skin care helps prevent acne effectively.",
