    "subsection_content": "There are many causes of warts on feet.\n1. Through scratches\nFalling, cutting, or accidentally scratching the skin leads to open wounds, creating conditions for the HPV virus to penetrate, spread, and form warts on the skin. Cases of scratch infection mainly occur when children are hyperactive, play with sand, and are not conscious of keeping their body clean.\n2. Metabolic disorders\nWarts on the soles of the feet are common in people with metabolic disorders such as diabetes, high blood fat... or weakened immune systems, such as infants and pregnant women, people with tuberculosis, HIV. …\n3. Contact with patients\nWarts can be transmitted directly from person to person through direct contact with an infected person. Once infected, warts can appear and spread anywhere on the body from the face to the feet. The disease is also commonly seen in nail workers, due to contact with many customers with skin diseases and not being equipped with protective equipment.\nWarts can also be transmitted sexually. Depending on the exposed skin area, acne can develop in the genital area, face, neck, legs, oral mucosa...\n4. Self-infection\nFrom a few initial warts, they will spread to neighboring skin areas or areas of skin with direct contact and form many tiny warts around them.\nWarts on the feet can make the patient feel very painful because they are often located in places that are compressed when walking or running. Some cases of warts on the feet disappear on their own after 3-6 months, but most persist and cause pain if the patient does not apply supportive treatment measures.\nWarts on the feet create discomfort for the patient when moving\nDepending on each person's immune system, warts are likely to develop or not, so not everyone exposed to the HPV virus will get warts. Warts can appear anywhere on the skin but are most common on the hands or feet. Each type of wart appears on a different body part and has a different shape. (2)",
