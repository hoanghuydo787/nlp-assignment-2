    "subsection_content": "Warts on the soles of the feet or legs can go away on their own, but there are many cases where warts gradually get bigger over time, causing pain and difficulty walking, so they need to be detected and treated promptly. Some suitable, safe and effective wart treatments used by doctors to treat foot warts include:\nUse salicylic acid: This acid will slowly destroy keratin cells, helping to peel off the cells. This method will work more effectively in conjunction with cryotherapy.; Cryotherapy: Freezing a foot wart with liquid nitrogen will form a blister under and around the wart. The recovery process will take a week or more for the wart to peel off. In addition, cryotherapy can also be combined with salicylic acid to increase treatment effectiveness. However, this method only erodes the upper part of the wart, so you need to repeat the process until the wart is completely removed. Patients may experience side effects from this therapy such as pain, blistering, and skin discoloration in the treatment area.\nCryotherapy is one of the effective wart treatment methods\nElectrocautery: Doctors will perform electrocautery in areas that are difficult to operate on for foot warts smaller than 1cm in size. Electrocautery uses high-frequency electric current with powerful destructive power to destroy warts. Note that the wound after electrocautery needs to be carefully cared for and cleaned to avoid infection.; Minor surgery: After anesthesia, doctors will remove the warts on the legs from the body with a knife. However, surgery carries the risk of scarring so it is not commonly used to treat plantar warts unless other treatments have failed. A scar located on the sole of the foot can cause pain for many years.; Laser: Using laser to vaporize tissue and photocoagulate blood vessels, at this time the damaged tissue will be necrotic, peel off and the wart on the foot will be removed. Because of the possibility of recurrence after treatment, this procedure may need to be repeated.; Vaccine: Although the original purpose was not to remove warts on the feet, the HPV vaccine has been used successfully to prevent and treat warts.",
