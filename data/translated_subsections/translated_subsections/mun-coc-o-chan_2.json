    "subsection_content": "Warts can appear anywhere on the legs. Common wart locations on the legs include:\nSoles of the feet: Unlike other types of warts, warts on the soles of the feet tend to have a flat texture and blend closer to the skin, rather than bulging like other warts because the feet are where we often walk. Body weight and pressure from daily travel make acne scars appear flatter. They appear in the form of a small hole, surrounded by a hard horny layer. Warts on the soles of the feet can also grow in clusters, making walking uncomfortable.; Heel: Warts on the heel are often warts, existing independently or singly. They are usually round in shape, surrounded by a thick horny layer, with a black spot in the middle due to capillary proliferation and blockage.; Toes: These are skin-colored or brown papules, their surface often has small black dots and just like warts on hands, after a while warts on feet will develop and gradually increase in size.; Between the toes: Warts on the feet can grow singly or in clusters. They are thick and rough in shape, like calluses on the soles of the feet or have many black dots made up of small blood vessels on the surface.; Toenails: Warts around the nails can be painful and can also affect nail growth. Initially the pimples are small in size but over time they gradually grow larger and spread to neighboring areas. They are shaped like rough broccoli, appear in the skin around the toenails, and sometimes cause cracking and pain as they grow. (3)",
