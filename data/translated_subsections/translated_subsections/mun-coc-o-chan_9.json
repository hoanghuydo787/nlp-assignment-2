Common warts can be diagnosed using one or more of the following techniques:\nCheck for warts.; Scrape the top layer of the wart to check for signs of small, dark dots (proliferating blood vessels).; Removing a small portion of the wart (scrape biopsy) and testing it for analysis in case there are other types of growths on the skin.\nDifferential diagnosis of warts includes:\nKeratosis and calluses (Clavi): are keratinizations that obscure skin lines but do not have many small black dots when shaved.; Lichen planus: Characterized by small, scattered red papules that may combine to form rough scaly plaques that may accompany lesions.; Seborrheic keratosis: are lesions on the skin surface, hyperpigmented skin, can appear as smooth or rough papules.; Achrocordon: small, smooth surface, pedunculated, more skin-colored than warts.; Squamous cell carcinoma: Can have warts, ulcers, bleeding, persistence, and irregular edges and colors.",
