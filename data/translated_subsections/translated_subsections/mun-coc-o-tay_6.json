    "subsection_content": "Hand warts are common in children and teenagers but can still appear at any age in the following cases:\n1. Skin damage\nThe HPV virus enters the body when the hands are scratched or cut. Here, the humid environment creates opportunities for them to grow and form warts. Therefore, people who often bite or pick their nails increase the risk of infection, making it easier for the HPV virus to attack.\n2. Direct contact\nWhen your hands touch an area of ​​the body that has warts, the risk of spreading it is very high. In addition, people who often share personal items such as towels, clothes, and nail clippers with people who have warts are very susceptible to infection.\n3. Weakened immune system\nPeople with weak resistance, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, eczema, etc. are at risk of getting warts on their hands and other parts of the body. Because the immune system is weakened, it is difficult to fight the invasion of HPV virus and develop into warts.\nHand warts are common in children and teenagers",
