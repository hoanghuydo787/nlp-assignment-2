    "subsection_content": "Patients do not need to worry too much about warts on their hands because there are many treatment methods available today. The following are common methods of treating hand warts:\n1. Treatment at home\nMany patients with warts often self-treat at home with garlic, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, tape... which is very dangerous and can make the disease worse. Although treating warts at home requires scientifically proven methods.\n1.1 Medicines containing salicylic acid\nThe medicine contains salicylic acid to help penetrate deep inside the wart to eliminate the HPV virus. To be effective, it is necessary to first remove the dead skin with a nail file or pumice stone. Next apply the medicine directly to the wart, according to your doctor's instructions or the instructions on the packaging. It takes several weeks for hand warts to fall off on their own. Discontinue  use if the medication causes irritation, swelling or pain.\nMedicines containing salicylic acid are prepared into preparations such as liquid, gel, and patch. Before treatment, patients should ask their doctor about the appropriate salicylic acid concentration for them.\n1.2 Imiquimod topical\nImiquimod when treating warts on the hands must be prescribed by a specialist. Imiquimod topical medication helps warts on hands fall off, but can easily cause pain and redness during treatment. This medicine combined with the cold spray method will bring better results.\n1.3 Podofilox topical\nLike topical imiquimod, podofilox helps warts fall off on their own. But in the area where the skin is applied, the patient will feel a burning sensation and slight itching.\n1.4 Topical 5-fluorouracil\nThis medicine is often used to treat warts on the hands of children. 5-fluorouracil topical should not be used without a doctor's prescription.\n2. Hospital treatment\n2.1 Lasers\nLaser therapy uses wavelengths of light that shine directly on the skin, helping to destroy wart cells. Among them, there are 2 main laser methods:\n2.2 Pulsed dye laser\nUsing light with a wavelength of 582nm, breaks down the blood vessels inside hand warts. The advantage is that it is highly effective and does not leave scars. This method does not require sedation or anesthesia for the patient.\n2.3 Carbon dioxide (CO2) laser\nThe laser vaporizes and destroys the wart tissue. Before using a laser beam on the wart on the hand, a local anesthetic is needed to reduce pain. This method does not leave extensive scars if the doctor is highly skilled.\n2.4 Cooling method\nFreezing helps freeze the warts on your hands and causes them to fall off on their own. There are 2 main cooling therapies:\n2.5 Cold spray\nThe cold spray method uses a mixture of dimethyl ether and propane (DMEP), often used to treat warts on the palms and feet. The drug is sold without a prescription, so you should read the instructions carefully before using.\nThe downside of this method is that a large damp sponge is not suitable for small warts. Patients need to use a moderate dose to avoid spreading it to normal skin areas, because the drug easily causes blistering.\n2.6 Liquid nitrogen\nLiquid nitrogen therapy is divided into several treatment sessions, each session spaced 1-2 weeks apart until completely cured. Nitrogen gas lowered to a temperature of – 196 degrees Celsius helps freeze the warts and causes them to fall off. Disadvantages can leave scars and change skin pigmentation.\n2.7 Electrocautery\nThe areas between the fingers are often difficult to operate on, or warts on the hands under 1cm are often treated with electrocautery. Using high-frequency current helps remove warts on hands quickly, simply and at low cost. But wound care must be careful to avoid infection and healing time is longer than with other methods.\n2.8 Minor surgery\nMinor surgical excision is usually applied to warts on the hand with a diameter of over 2cm, growing in a flat location. Advantages: faster than electrocautery, easier wound care and less infection. However, warts on the hands easily recur because the nucleus cannot be completely removed and can leave scars.",
