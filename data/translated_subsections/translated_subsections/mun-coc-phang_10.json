    "subsection_content": "1. Medicines\nThe medicine treats flat warts with a mechanism to make the warts peel off on their own. This method is safe and rarely causes dangerous complications, but patients need to persevere in doing it to see results. Medications commonly used to treat flat warts include:\n1.1 Salicylic acid:\nThis is the main ingredient in aspirin, often the first choice for treating flat warts. This method has low cost, few side effects and has many different preparations such as liquids, gels, patches,... and salicylic acid concentrations from 17% to 40%.\nFirst, the patient needs to wet the flat wart in water for 10-15 minutes, then remove the dead skin layer of the flat wart, then apply salicylic acid. Need to do it 1-2 times in 12 weeks to see results.\nSalicylic acid is suitable for areas with thick skin, such as the soles of the feet, because acidic drugs can easily damage areas of thin skin. Flat warts on the soles of the feet, using salicylic acid patches will see results within a few days.\n1.2 Imiquimod topical\nThis medicine is very suitable for flat warts. When applied to the area where flat warts appear, it will cause the warts to fall off on their own. However, during treatment, imiquimod makes the skin area painful, red and swollen. Topical imiquimod combined with cryotherapy will be more effective. When used, Imiquimod must be prescribed by doctors.\n1.3 Podofilox topical\nApply podofilox directly to the flat wart to let it fall off on its own. Symptoms when applying the medicine include itching, a slight numbness like a burn, etc.\n1.4 Topical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)\nTopical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is commonly used to treat flat warts in children. Parents should not arbitrarily buy it to apply to their children but need to get a prescription from a specialist.\n1.5 Inject bleomycin\nBleomycin is a chemotherapy drug that treats cancer. When injected directly into warts, it is also effective in treatment. This method is only for cases where flat warts are not effective with other methods.\n2. Cooling therapy\nThere are two main ways of cooling therapy:\n2.1 Liquid nitrogen\nDoctors will spray liquid nitrogen at a temperature of -196 degrees Celsius onto the area where the flat wart appears. Liquid nitrogen causes tissue damage, consequent blood vessel stasis, freezing of extracellular spaces, and destruction of warts. Each treatment session is 1-2 weeks apart and takes about 3-4 months to completely heal.\n2.2 Dimethyl ether and propane mixture (DMEP)\nCold spray with DMEP is suitable for flat warts on the palms and soles of the feet. The drug is available without a prescription, but you should read the instructions carefully before using. If excess dosage is used, it can easily cause blistering to surrounding skin areas.\n3. Lasers\n3.1 CO2 Laser\nActive lasers selectively absorb water molecules. Before the procedure, the patient is given local anesthesia by the doctor to reduce pain. The CO2 Laser shines on flat warts, vaporizing and destroying tissue and skin. If the doctor is highly skilled, the patient does not have to worry about leaving extensive scars.\n3.2 Pulsed dye laser\nPulsed dye lasers are directed at the flat wart, burning the small blood vessels inside. The infected tissue is then destroyed and the flat wart falls off. During treatment there is no need to use sedatives or local anesthesia. The advantage of pulsed dye laser is that it helps remove flat warts quickly, leaving little scarring.\n4. Electrocautery\nThe electrocautery method uses an electric current to help remove flat warts and is performed quickly and simply. Electrocautery is suitable for flat warts in difficult-to-surgical locations, with a diameter of less than 1cm. Because digging deeply to remove the core of flat warts often leaves scars and careless wound care can easily cause infection...\n5. Minor surgery\nMinor surgery is suitable for flat warts less than 2cm in diameter and growing in a flat position. This therapy is faster than electrocautery, easier to care for incisions, and lowers the risk of infection. However, minor surgery can leave scars and flat warts will recur if all the warts are not removed.\nActively vaccinate against HPV to prevent flat warts from appearing",
