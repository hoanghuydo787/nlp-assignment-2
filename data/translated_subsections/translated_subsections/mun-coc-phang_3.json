Once it enters the host's body, the virus begins to thicken the top layer of skin and  forms a flat wart.\nHPV virus enters the body through cases such as: scratches on the body, sharing personal items with a person with flat warts, spreading from one part of the body to another, direct contact contact with the patient. In addition, people with weakened immune systems are susceptible to HPV virus.",
