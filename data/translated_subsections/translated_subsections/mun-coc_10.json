    "subsection_content": "When suffering from warts, patients should go to medical facilities to receive advice on appropriate treatment methods. Sometimes, warts can disappear on their own, but this is very rare. There are cases where patients self-treat at home and suffer serious complications. Below are methods to treat warts:\n1. Treat warts with topical medication\n1.1 Salicylic acid\nSalicylic acid is a popular treatment choice. Before applying salicylic acid, you should soak the wart in warm water, then apply the medicine directly to the damaged area. Use regularly for 2 - 3 months to achieve treatment effectiveness.\nAbsolutely do not let the acid spread to surrounding skin and cover tightly after use, store in a cool place. Do not use salicylic acid for patients with diabetes, heart disease or infected warts, etc. If the medicine gets into your eyes, rinse with clean water for 15 minutes, then quickly see an eye specialist for treatment. take timely remedial measures.\n1.2 Cantharidin\nCantharidin is an odorless, colorless fat derived from beetles. The ingredients in Cantharidin can cause the damaged skin around the wart to blister, then the wart will peel off. In fact, this product only works on the surface of the skin so it leaves no scars.\nCantharidin should only be performed by a dermatologist, as it may cause skin irritation. In addition, Cantharidin also causes pain and discomfort for patients. With plantar warts, using Cantharidin can cause infection or cellulitis if not cleaned thoroughly.\n2. Wart treatment methods at the hospital\n2.1 Cryotherapy\nCryotherapy in wart treatment is divided into several sessions. Each time, the doctor will spray liquid nitrogen into the wart, at which point a blister will form. After a while, the blisters and warts will peel off on their own.\nCryotherapy with liquid nitrogen can cause scarring, numbness, temporary loss of sensation or permanent loss of skin pigmentation. Patients with skin that is too light or too dark should not be treated with cryotherapy, especially those with warts on the face. This technique can be painful so it should not be used to treat warts in young children.\n2.2 Electrosurgery/curettage\nThe method combines electric burning and manual curettage, applied to warts in flat positions, less than 2cm in size. Before acne removal surgery, the patient will be given local anesthesia. This is a method that causes less infection and heals the wound quickly. However, the disease easily recurs because the acne's core and roots are not completely removed.\n2.3 Excision\nThis technique is indicated to remove filiform warts. The doctor will use a scalpel to shave or remove the wart.\n2.4 Lasers\nThe doctor will use light from the Fractional CO2 Laser machine to heat and destroy small blood vessels inside the wart. This method is applied to patients with severe warts to completely remove rough warts on the skin and prevent their spread to surrounding skin. However, this technique can cause pain and leave scars.\n2.5 Bleomycin\nBleomycin is a water-soluble glycopeptide antibiotic with cytotoxic effects, used to treat warts that do not respond to other methods. Bleomycin helps inhibit cell division and growth. This method causes a number of side effects including: pain during and after injection, scarring, pigment changes, etc. Do not use bleomycin in pregnant women.\n2.6 Immunotherapy\nFor stubborn warts that do not respond to traditional treatment methods, immunotherapy will affect the virus that causes the disease and improve the condition. The doctor will use certain chemicals, such as diphencyprone (DCP), to make the wart disappear.",
