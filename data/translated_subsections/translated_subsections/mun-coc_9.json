    "subsection_content": "Diagnosis of warts is based on clinical symptoms; biopsy is rarely used. Symptoms of warts include:\nA small, raised bump on the skin; Average size ranges from 1 – 10mm.; Acne has a rough or smooth surface; Warts appear singly or in clusters; In some cases, warts cause itching; Face, feet. Knees and hands are most commonly affected.\nAdditionally, the differential diagnosis of warts includes:\nAnkle or callus (clavi): lesion still has skin lines, no capillary thrombosis when scraping.; Lichen planus: similar to flat warts. Acne is also accompanied by oral lesions, Wickham's network and symmetrical distribution.; Seborrheic keratosis: papules or plaques appear multiple, hyperpigmented, and have keratin-filled cysts.; Squamous cell carcinoma: in this case the skin lesions are ulcerated, persistent and develop irregular edges.\nWarts can heal on their own, especially common warts, but other types can persist for many years after treatment and, even worse, recur in the same location or elsewhere. Depending on the patient's systemic immune status as well as local factors, it will be related to the recurrence of warts.\nWarts are highly contagious and are mainly transmitted through direct skin contact.",
