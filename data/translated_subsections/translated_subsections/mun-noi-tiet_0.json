    "subsection_content": "Hormonal acne, commonly known as acne, occurs due to changes in hormones in the body. Hormonal acne affects all age groups, most commonly during puberty, women before and after giving birth, premenopausal - menopausal or during the menstrual cycle. This is the period when the body undergoes certain changes that cause hormonal disorders, forming hormonal acne.\nHormonal acne is a common dermatological condition in the United States. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) estimates that, at any given time, up to 50 million people in this country have hormonal acne. (2)\n1. Characteristics of hormonal acne\nDuring puberty, hormonal acne often appears in the T-zone (including hormonal acne on the forehead, nose, and chin).; For adults, acne appears on the lower part of the face, including the cheeks and the skin around the jawbone.; Blackheads, whiteheads, cysts.; Acne is located deep under the skin, inflamed, red and swollen causing pain; Hormonal acne easily appears in the following cases: puberty, menstruation, menopause, polycystic ovary syndrome, pregnancy, excessive increases in androgen levels (hormones that stimulate the increased sebum secretion).; Changing hormone levels can make acne more serious, such as: causing full-body dermatitis, increased sweat and sebum secretion from pores, clogged skin cells in hair follicles, creating conditions for bacteria. Propionibacterium acnes bacteria grow and cause acne.\n2. Acne due to menopause\nAcne in menopause or premenopause is a form of hormonal acne. All acne stems from clogged pores, but teenage and menopausal acne are distinctly different. (3)\nTeenage acne often appears in the T-zone (including the forehead, nose and chin).; Acne in menopause is mainly cystic acne, whiteheads or cystic acne hidden deep under the skin.\nWomen with menopausal acne may experience a decrease in estrogen hormone levels or an increase in androgen hormones, especially testosterone.\nIn some cases, acne occurs even when women use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to ease symptoms of menopause. This is because HRT uses certain types of progestin hormones to replace the estrogen and progesterone that the body loses. This hormone can cause pores to expand, allowing dirt and bacteria to penetrate, forming acne.\nAcne caused by endocrine disorders can be mild, moderate or severe.\nMild acne is mainly blackheads and whiteheads. Acne is classified as mild when there are less than 20 cysts, 15 inflammatory lesions or less than 30 non-inflammatory acne.; At moderate levels, acne may or may not be inflamed, leaving scars. Acne is classified as moderate when there are 20-100 pimples, 15-50 inflammatory lesions, or 30-125 total lesions.; Severe acne often becomes inflamed and leaves scars.\nAcne can affect your psychology. Even mild acne makes people lose confidence. This often affects young people who are starting to develop relationships.\nWomen are susceptible to hormonal acne.",
