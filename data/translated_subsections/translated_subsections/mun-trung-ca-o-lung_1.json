In addition, hormonal problems that cause acne can also occur in pregnant women or during menstruation.; Sweat gland activity: Overactive sweat glands, combined with being \"held back\" under tight clothing, is a significant cause of acne on the back.; Poor body hygiene: Poor hygiene is also the cause of excess oil, dirt, and dead cells damaging the skin and clogging pores, causing acne; Clothes that are too tight and not washed thoroughly: This dressing habit makes it difficult for the skin to \"breathe\"; From there, dirt and sweat are trapped, making the skin susceptible to irritation and infection. The bacteria that cause back acne from here also have favorable conditions to multiply and attack.; Not showering after sweating a lot: This is one of the poor hygiene habits that not only increases the risk of acne on the back, but also other areas such as the chest, arms, and neck. In addition to acne, not cleaning the body when sweating a lot also leads to many other skin diseases.; Using inappropriate products: Some cosmetic products such as shampoo, shower gel, lotion, etc. can cause skin irritation or affect the skin's sebum secretion, causing the skin to become more oily. Back acne then has a greater risk of forming.; Other causes: Genetics, age, gender (men are often more susceptible to acne than women), eating habits (eating a lot of sweets or dairy foods,...), weight (overweight, obesity), stress, frequent exposure to sunlight, alcohol/stimulant abuse, etc. are factors that can affect back acne.",
