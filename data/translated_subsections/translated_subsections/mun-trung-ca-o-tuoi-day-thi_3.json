    "subsection_content": "1. Acne is not caused by inflammation\nThis type of acne is considered quite \"comfortable\", causes little damage and is easy to treat. The characteristic of non-inflammatory acne is that it has a hard core; Includes 2 familiar \"faces\":\nBlackheads: Bacteria, dead cells or oxidized sebum on the skin surface at the open hair follicles form black acne spots.; Whiteheads: Pores are also clogged by dead cells, excess oil or bacteria but are different from blackheads; Here the hair follicle will close, creating a white pimple.\n2. Acne due to inflammation\nInflammatory acne causes more serious damage such as larger acne sizes, acne that easily causes swelling/redness/tissue infection, and a high risk of acne scarring. 4 common types of inflammatory acne during puberty include:\nPapules: These are small, swollen pimples that are red or pink in color, or are sensitive to external influences such as squeezing pimples. If papules appear a lot during puberty, it is a warning sign that the acne is no longer mild but is moderate to severe.; Pustules: Pustules have an external appearance quite similar to whiteheads, the difference is that pustules have a small red circle around the base of the acne - a sign of inflamed skin. This type of acne in puberty also does not have a hard core, instead there is yellow or white pus. Do not arbitrarily squeeze pustules to avoid making acne worse or leaving deep scars.; Cystic acne: Usually appears more in men than women; is a condition in which inflammatory bacteria attack deep into the skin structure. Besides the face, acne can also appear on the chest and back. Acne, if not treated properly, can cause pain, severe redness and swelling, and can easily recur; Cystic acne: Also known as a cyst, it is a type of pimple under the skin that is large in size (sometimes the size of a pea) filled with pus or fluid and causes a lot of pain. Cystic acne appears when inflammation is severe. Because it is a form of acne that \"eats deep\" into the skin, when removing acne cores, there is a high risk of leaving scars.\nCommon types of puberty acne",
