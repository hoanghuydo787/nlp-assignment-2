(4); Azelaic Acid: Helps clean pores, reduce acne and limit the risk of acne recurring. However, this ingredient only works well in cases of mild to moderate teenage acne; Benzoyl Peroxide: Abbreviated as BPO. This drug has the effect of killing bacteria and peeling off the stratum corneum, so it is often used to treat types of acne such as blackheads/whiteheads, cystic acne, inflammatory acne, etc.; Retinol: A derivative of vitamin A, Retinol is used to treat acne during puberty because of its ability to reduce excess oil, unclog hair follicles, help control and reduce acne - notably preventing cysts and nodules. . In addition, this active ingredient also has anti-aging effects, helps brighten and even skin tone as well as moisturizes the skin.

In the treatment of acne – especially moderate to severe acne – Clindamycin is available in both topical and oral forms.\n2. Treat teenage acne with natural tips\nSome natural ingredients are also effective in treating mild to moderate teenage acne. There are two ingredients that stand out for their antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties: fresh lemon juice and honey.\nUse lemon juice: Lemon juice works best when used as an astringent or as a topical acne treatment. For mild types of teenage acne, you just need to use a cotton swab and gently apply lemon juice on the top of the acne. Hold for a few seconds and rinse afterwards. You can do this several times a day; However, this method should only be used for a short time. This method requires careful sun protection.; Treat acne with honey: The antibacterial and soothing properties of honey both help kill acne-causing bacteria and help reduce redness and swelling. You can combine honey with other ingredients such as yogurt, banana or oatmeal to create an acne treatment mask or use a very small amount directly on acne spots. It should be noted that you should only use pure honey and use a sufficient amount to avoid the risk of skin irritation - especially with sensitive skin.\n3. Use cream to treat puberty acne\nAcne cream is a popular choice in treating acne during puberty because of its convenience and effectiveness. To treat acne quickly and safely, users should choose a cream product suitable for their skin type. For example, if you have dry skin, you should not choose a cream with oil control properties.
