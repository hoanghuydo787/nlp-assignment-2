    "subsection_content": "The mechanism that causes acne is determined by the following 4 factors:\nIncreased sebum secretion: includes endocrine factors and non-endocrine factors (soap, having oily skin, increased level of sebum secretion...).; Sebaceous duct keratinization disorder: narrows or even blocks the sebum drainage pathway, causing sebum stagnation.\nWhen the hair follicle, especially the neck of the sebaceous gland, becomes keratinized, causing the sebaceous secretion duct to narrow, causing sebum to stagnate in the lumen of the sebaceous gland. If superinfection does not occur, the sebum condenses into acne (about 30 days). If superinfection occurs, the sebaceous gland will produce pus, the infection spreads to other sebaceous glands, causing cystic acne and inflammatory acne.\nBacteria: streptococcus, staphylococcus and especially Cuti Bacterium acnes in the sebaceous ducts. This is the most important bacteria in the pathogenesis of acne. It is an anaerobic gram-positive bacteria that grows best in pH conditions of 5-5.6 and temperature of 30-37 degrees Celsius. The human body has an increased sebum secretion and thickened hair follicles. The residue is a condition for anaerobic bacteria to grow. Among them, Cuti Bacterium acnes plays a major role in the development of acne; Inflammation: appearance of acne-causing bacteria, creating biological substances. These substances activate the complement system and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, causing folliculitis.\nAcne often appears in skin areas with many oil (sebaceous) glands such as the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders. Hair follicles are connected to oil glands.\nThe cyst wall can swell and create whiteheads or blackheads due to enlarged pores. To the naked eye, blackheads can look like dirt stuck in pores. However, acne forms because pores are clogged with accumulated oil and bacteria, and when exposed to air, they turn dark brown.",
