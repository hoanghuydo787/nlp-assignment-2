    "subsection_content": "According to clinical classification, melasma is divided into: patchy melasma, deep melasma and mixed melasma. (4)\n1. Agricultural melasma\nSuperficial melasma is formed by melanocyte cells putting melanin pigment into the keratin cell layer. This type of melasma is light brown, shallow, located in the epidermis or outermost layer of skin, often concentrated in small patches. Shallow melasma appears mainly on the forehead, cheekbones, nose and chin, with clear borders that are easy to distinguish from the surrounding skin.\n2. Deep melasma\nDeep melasma is light brown to dark black, with blurred borders. Melasma is located deep under the skin because melanocyte cells push melanin pigment from the dermis deep inside. This type of melasma appears in small, round spots similar to post-acne dark spots. Melasma is common in women over 30 years old and people in premenopause.\n3. Mixed melasma\nMixed melasma is the most common type, including shallow and deep melasma, appearing scattered mainly on the forehead, cheeks, nose, and skin around the eyes. Mixed melasma has deep roots, uneven color and size. This is the most difficult type of melasma to treat.\nThe process of forming melasma.",
