    "subsection_content": "To treat melasma, doctors will first find the cause of the disease. Depending on each case, melasma can disappear on its own, fade, last for several years, or even permanently. Treatment of melasma needs to be considered, based on each condition and cause to have an appropriate method.\nIt is not always necessary to treat melasma. In the case of melasma due to hormonal changes, pregnant women or taking birth control pills, this condition may decrease after giving birth or stopping using the drug. If skin pigmentation is caused by too much exposure to sunlight, LED screens, cosmetics or scented soaps, the patient can temporarily stop using or limit exposure to the above causes. At the same time, see a dermatologist for examination and advice on appropriate treatment.\nSome ways to treat melasma that can be referred to are:\nTranexamic acid: topical medication that helps treat melasma or fade post-acne dark spots; Chemical peels: use glycolic acid, alpha hydroxy acid and salicylic acid to remove dark skin without affecting the regeneration of new cells.; Using laser: laser beams help destroy pigments that cause melasma, increase collagen to form new cell layers, fade melasma, even out and brighten skin tone.; Mesotherapy: the doctor uses a syringe with a small needle tip to deliver active ingredients that can inhibit the production of pigment into the skin layers. The advantage of this procedure is that the medicine will not be hindered by the stratum corneum, so it will be more effective, compared to using topical medication or electrophoresis; Azelaic acid: cream, lotion or gel, apply twice a day. Pregnant women can use this medicine.; Methimazole: used in cases of hydroquinone-resistant melasma. Treatment is by reducing the synthesis of melanin pigment.; Soybean extract: reduces the transition from melanocytes to skin cells. Helps repel melasma and freckles, and at the same time, protects the skin from the harmful effects of the external environment.; Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA): group of acids derived from plants (sugarcane, grapes, citrus fruits) and animals (royal jelly). Cosmetics containing AHA help regulate pigmentation, brighten skin, reduce wrinkles, etc.; Hydroquinone: helps lighten dark skin patches such as melasma, age spots, and freckles. Hydroquinone can come in cream, gel, lotion, or emulsion form. Normally, it takes at least 4 weeks for the drug to take effect and it takes 2 - 4 months of regular use for noticeable results.; Tretinoin: topical medication, used to treat acne, wrinkles or sun damage. Note, do not use Tretinoin for pregnant women.",
