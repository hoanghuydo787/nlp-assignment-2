    "subsection_content": "Endocrine melasma (also known as deep melasma) is an endocrine disorder that leads to an imbalance of hormones in the body, forming hyperpigmented spots on the skin surface. The formation of melasma is mainly related to estrogen (female hormone). This is a sex hormone that plays an important role in the body and has the ability to inhibit the production of MSH hormone (a hormone that stimulates increased melanin production under the skin).\nIf estrogen in the body decreases and cannot inhibit the hormone MSH, then the uncontrolled production of melanin cells will push to the surface of the skin to form melasma.\nEstrogen is a synthesis of 3 substances: estrone, estradiol, estriol. Estrogen plays an important role in women, helping the body regulate the reproductive system, hair, skin... Estrogen in women is produced more slowly as they enter aging, causing hormonal imbalance that increases melanin production, leading to premature aging. endocrine melasma.\nEndocrine melasma has pigmented areas that appear concentrated in round spots on the skin surface, with roots deeply embedded in the skin's structural layers (usually found in the basement membrane of the epidermis, sometimes deep into the middle layer). tare).",
