Patients need to find out the cause of melasma to have appropriate treatment methods to avoid affecting their health. Ways to distinguish between hormonal melasma and sunburn include:\n1. Endocrine melasma\nEndocrine melasma is formed due to hormonal disorders that cause hormone imbalance in the body, stimulating the production of more melanin, creating hyperpigmented spots on the skin surface. In addition, when using some medications, they also cause side effects that disrupt hormones and cause melasma.\nIn addition, the following factors will also contribute to the appearance of hormonal melasma: prolonged stress will affect the activity of the ovaries causing hormonal changes, using birth control pills containing progestins, hormonal changes when pregnancy or postpartum, menopause, irregular menstruation.\nHormonal melasma will decrease when the endocrine condition is balanced to a normal level (for example, hormonal melasma due to pregnancy, after giving birth, the endocrine system will return to normal, then melasma will gradually decrease. ).\n2. Sunburn (common melasma)\nSunburn often occurs due to the impact of external factors such as:\nEnvironment: exposure to sunlight, blue light with heat radiation from electronic devices, polluted environment: car exhaust, dust, chemicals...; Using poor quality cosmetics of unknown origin containing corticosteroids thins the skin. When exposed to solar radiation or electronic radiation, the skin will be melasma.; In addition, diet, rest time, living habits, skin care... are also one of the causes of melasma.",
