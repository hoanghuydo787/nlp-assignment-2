    "subsection_content": "1. Is outer ear fungus contagious?\nOtitis externa is a fungal infection. The disease can spread from person to person if exposed to the fungus, especially in immunocompromised patients.\nSharing earwax removal tools increases the risk of fungal infection. Ear surgical instruments that are not thoroughly sterilized can also lead to this risk.\n2. Is external ear fungus dangerous?\nTypically, fungal infections of the external auditory canal only cause persistent discomfort limited to the patient's external auditory canal. Although rare, the disease can have invasive complications that cause bone destruction, mastoid infection, temporal bone infection if not treated promptly, and infection that spreads to the intracranial cavity can cause meningitis.\nMeningitis is a threat to life, especially in children and people with immunodeficiency diseases.\n3. Can external ear fungus go away on its own?\nFungal infections of the outer ear rarely go away without treatment. Patients need to see a doctor to receive appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The treatment regimen is usually clean ears combined with treatment with antifungal ear drops. In cases of complications of infection of the mastoid and temporal bones, surgical intervention may be required.\nExternal ear canal fungus is a fairly common Ear, Nose and Throat disease in our country due to hot and humid climate conditions, which are favorable for fungi to grow and cause disease. Due to its difficult to treat and persistent nature, with easy recurrence, patients need to be treated early and properly to avoid prolonging the disease, causing complications that affect hearing and even threaten life. External auditory canal fungi can cause complications of mastoiditis and temporal bone inflammation in immunocompromised patients.\nDoctor Ho Van Huu emphasized that treating fungal infections of the external ear canal with medication must be prescribed by a doctor.
