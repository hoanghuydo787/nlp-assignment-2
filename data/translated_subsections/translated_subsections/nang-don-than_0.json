    "subsection_content": "A single kidney cyst is a cyst with only a separate kidney lobe, usually appearing in the renal cortex, consisting of a thin layer of tissue in the cyst wall, containing fluid inside and not communicating with the renal pelvis.\nSingle cystic kidney (left) – Polycystic kidney (right)\nUnlike polycystic kidney disease, simple kidney cysts are largely caused by genetic disorders. The disease also does not develop in the entire kidney or replace the structure of the kidney, nor does it reduce kidney function like in people with polycystic kidneys.\nA person may have multiple cysts on one kidney, or on both kidneys. This cyst is a common benign kidney disease that does not affect kidney function. However, in many cases, kidney cysts will gradually increase in size over time. When the kidney cyst size is too large, it will cause reduced kidney function. Health monitoring and periodic examinations are needed for screening.\nSolitary kidney cysts are common in many different ages. The common rate in people over 40 years old is about 25%, 50% in people over 50 years old and 90% in people over 70 years old. Because it is a benign disease, treatment is rarely needed. Most people with polycystic kidneys do not know they have the disease, except for routine medical examinations or unusual conditions when kidney cysts are too large.",
