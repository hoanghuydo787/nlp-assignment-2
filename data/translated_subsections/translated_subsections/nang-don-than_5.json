    "subsection_content": "Single kidney cysts do not cause clinical symptoms, so patients often do not know they are sick. Most doctors discover patients with kidney cysts during medical examination or health screening using diagnostic imaging (ultrasound, CT scan, MRI) or some tests related to urine and blood. In the case of just diagnosing the disease, doctors will apply diagnostic techniques such as:\n1. Kidney ultrasound\nKidney ultrasound is a technique often chosen by doctors to diagnose and screen for kidney diseases. Currently, modern ultrasound equipment in many hospitals has met standards for diagnosing kidney cysts such as: Echo free block; round or oval shape; The cyst wall is smooth, thin, and the edges are clear; Allows sound waves to penetrate well. Increases the echo behind the cyst.\n2. Intravenous nephrography (UIV)\nUIV is also the technique chosen by many doctors to diagnose kidney cysts. Intravenous nephrography technique shows the shadow of the renal cyst and the image of insertion into the renal pelvis system and whether the cyst communicates with the renal pelvis or not. However, UIV can only diagnose large kidney cysts. For cysts that are small in size, not enough to cause compression of the renal pelvis. Or cysts that are not located in the kidney parenchyma area are very difficult to detect with UIV. UIV is indicated for patients with renal cysts measuring 4cm or larger or cases where the cyst is suspected of compressing the renal pelvis.\n3. Computerized tomography (CT scanner)\nCT scanner of the urinary system is a non-invasive imaging test used to evaluate the urinary system, providing detailed images of layers cut along the body axis from the kidneys to the prostate. CT scanner helps doctors observe parenchymal details, renal pelvis, excretory tracts, ureters, prostate, and bladder.\nCT scanner not only diagnoses simple kidney cysts but also helps doctors diagnose other kidney diseases such as: Kidney stones; bladder stones; ureteral stones; Urinary tract infection, or pyelonephritis, cystitis; Urinary system tumors; Or even cancer.",
