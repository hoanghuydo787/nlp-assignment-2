    "subsection_content": "Each breast contains mammary lobes, arranged like the petals of a daisy. The lobes are divided into smaller lobules for milk production during pregnancy and lactation. The supporting tissue that gives the breast its shape is made up of fatty tissue and fibrous connective tissue. Breast cysts develop due to the accumulation of fluid inside the mammary glands.\nCurrently, the cause of breast cysts is unknown, which may form due to hormonal changes each monthly menstrual cycle. That's why breast cysts are most common in women who are still of reproductive age. Only a small percentage of breast cysts occur in postmenopausal women.",
