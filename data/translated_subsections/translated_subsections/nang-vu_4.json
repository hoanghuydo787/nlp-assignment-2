    "subsection_content": "Diagnosis of breast cysts usually includes a breast exam, imaging tests (breast ultrasound or mammogram), and possibly fine needle aspiration or breast biopsy.\n1. Clinical breast examination\nAfter asking about your symptoms and health history, your doctor will examine the breast mass and check for any other breast abnormalities. You will then need another test, such as an imaging test or fine needle aspiration.\nMSc. Doctor Nguyen Do Thuy Giang (Head of Breast Surgery Department - Tam Anh General Hospital) reads test results to the patient\n2. Mammography\nMammography is an early screening method to detect breast cancer. This method uses X-rays to create images of the inside of the breast. Large cysts and clusters of small cysts can often be seen with a mammogram. But microscopic cysts may be difficult or impossible to see on x-rays.\nDuring a mammogram, your breast will be placed on a flat surface and compressed to create clearer images. This method may cause mild discomfort or pain, but it usually only lasts a few seconds.\nMammography helps detect and screen for breast diseases, including breast cysts\n3. Breast ultrasound\nBreast ultrasound is a safe and non-invasive method that does not use X-rays or radiation and is painless to the patient. Ultrasound is recommended for women over 40 years of age or with a family history of breast cancer for routine breast screening.\nBreast ultrasound helps doctors determine whether a mass in the breast is fluid-filled or solid. A fluid-filled mass is usually a breast cyst. The solid mass may be a benign breast tumor (such as a fibroadenoma) or it may be breast cancer.\nYour doctor may recommend a biopsy for further evaluation if it is a solid mass. If your doctor can easily feel the breast cyst, he or she may skip the imaging tests and perform a fine-needle aspiration to drain the fluid and deflate the cyst.\n4. Fine needle aspiration\nDuring fine needle aspiration, the doctor inserts a thin needle into the breast cyst and withdraws the fluid. Typically, fine needle aspiration is performed using ultrasound to guide the needle accurately into the cyst. If after draining all the fluid and the breast mass disappears, your doctor can diagnose a breast cyst\nIf the fluid is bloodless and straw-colored and the breast mass disappears, you do not need further testing or treatment.; If bloody fluid or breast mass does not go away, your doctor may send a sample of the fluid for testing and further imaging tests may be needed to evaluate.; If the fluid is not drained, your doctor will likely recommend testing with an imaging test, such as a mammogram or diagnostic breast ultrasound. Removal of little fluid or a lump in the breast that does not disappear after removal indicates a lump in the breast or that part of the lump is solid. A biopsy of a tissue sample may be performed to rule out cancer.",
