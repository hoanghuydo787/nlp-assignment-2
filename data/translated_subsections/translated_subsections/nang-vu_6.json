    "subsection_content": "No treatment is needed for simple breast cysts, which are fluid-filled and do not cause any symptoms, confirmed on breast ultrasound or after fine-needle aspiration. Many breast cysts will disappear without treatment. If the cyst persists, feels firmer, or you notice skin changes over the cyst, see your doctor immediately.\n1. Fine needle aspiration (FNA)\nFine needle aspiration (FNA) is a procedure used to collect a cell or fluid sample from a breast cyst suspected of being cancerous.\nFine needle aspiration can be used to diagnose and treat breast cysts, after which the cysts will disappear and symptoms will go away.\nThe procedure of small needle puncture into breast cysts needs to be performed by qualified doctors and technicians\nHowever, for some breast cysts, multiple aspiration may be required. New cysts often appear or recur. If a breast cyst persists through two to three menstrual cycles and gets larger, see your doctor immediately for further evaluation.\n2. Use hormonal drugs\nUsing hormonal medications such as birth control pills to regulate the menstrual cycle can help reduce the recurrence of breast cysts. But because of the potentially significant side effects, birth control pills, or other hormonal therapies such as tamoxifen, are usually only recommended for women with severe symptoms. Stopping hormone therapy after menopause may also help prevent breast cysts.\n3. Surgery\nBreast cystectomy is only necessary in unusual cases. Surgery may be considered if the cyst causes discomfort, recurs monthly, or if the cyst contains bloody fluid or has other worrying signs.\nBefore deciding to have surgery, patients need to discuss with their doctor to clearly understand the risks and benefits of surgery, as well as how to prepare before and after surgery.",
