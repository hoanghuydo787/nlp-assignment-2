    "subsection_content": "Hydrocephalus, also known in English as Hydrocephalus, is defined as a pathological condition of the central nervous system, resulting from disruption or imbalance between the formation, flow circulation or absorption of fluid. cerebrospinal fluid. In other words, it is the accumulation of too much cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles of the brain due to disturbances in the production, circulation and absorption processes. Hydrocephalus can be an acute or chronic condition that occurs over months or years. Different forms of the disease include obstructive, communicating, and normal pressure hydrocephalus.\nThe brain has hollow, fluid-filled cavities called ventricles. Inside the ventricles is a ribbon-like structure called the choroid plexus – which functions to create cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) – a clear, colorless fluid. CSF circulates within and around the brain and spinal cord, helping to cushion these organs from the effects of injury. It is absorbed and replenished continuously. (first)\nThere are two ventricles deep inside the two cerebral hemispheres, they are called lateral ventricles. These two ventricles connect to the third ventricle through a separate opening called the foramen of Monro. The third ventricle connects to the fourth ventricle through a long, narrow tube called the aqueduct of Sylvius. From the fourth ventricle, cerebrospinal fluid flows into the subarachnoid space where it cleanses and cushions the brain. CSF is absorbed by special structures in the superior sagittal sinus called arachnoid granulations.\nNormally the amount of cerebrospinal fluid absorbed is in balance with the amount of cerebrospinal fluid produced. However, when there is a disruption or blockage in the circulation system, cerebrospinal fluid accumulates, causing the ventricles of the brain to swell (hydrocephalus).",
