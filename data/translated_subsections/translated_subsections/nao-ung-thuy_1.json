    "subsection_content": "Hydrocephalus can occur in all ethnic groups, all countries and all ages due to two groups of congenital and acquired causes. The average frequency of congenital hydrocephalus in European countries is about 0.5-0.8/1000 births. The disease tends to increase, the frequency is currently higher than Down syndrome. In Vietnam, the frequency of disease in children is equivalent to other countries in the world, the rate of boys and girls getting the disease is the same. (2)\nCongenital hydrocephalus: These are cases where hydrocephalus has a genetic factor or occurs due to some incident during pregnancy or can also be acquired in the first months of life after birth. These include: Cerebral aqueduct stenosis, myelomeningocele, congenital fluid cyst, intraventricular hemorrhage in premature infants, congenital infection, Arnold-Chiari malformation type II.; Acquired hydrocephalus: These are cases of secondary hydrocephalus occurring after contracting certain diseases such as bacterial meningitis, intracranial hemorrhage, brain tumors...; Hydrocephalus in adults: In adults, when trauma or injury occurs, the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid can change, the ventricles of the brain become enlarged when cerebrospinal fluid accumulates. Because the structure of the adult skull is solid and cannot expand, pressure in the brain can increase severely, and if left untreated, can cause brain damage or death.",
