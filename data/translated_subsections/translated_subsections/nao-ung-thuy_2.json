    "subsection_content": "In newborns (infants): In infants, because the skull joints are not yet closed, the most visible symptom is that the size of the head increases abnormally quickly, and the child's scalp is thin and shiny. In addition, the anterior fontanel is also widened and tense, the cranial suture line is widened, it is possible to feel the anterior fontanel adjacent to the posterior fontanel, and the blood vessels under the scalp are also larger than normal. Lost signs of pulse. The child's forehead is very wide. The eyes are usually in a downward-looking position, creating a sunset sign. (3); In children: In older children, when the skull joints are partially closed, the sign of a large head is more difficult to recognize. However, children who come to the clinic late often have a strangely large head. Symptoms are usually: An increase in head circumference of more than 2 standard deviations can be seen as a sign of a broken tank shell. Irritability, irritability, fatigue, loss of appetite, vomiting a lot in the morning. Headache is a prominent sign that children often have severe headaches in the morning and vomiting. Blurred vision can occur with midbrain syndrome (Parinaud syndrome), papilledema can cause optic papilla atrophy, double vision due to sixth nerve paralysis (due to severe increased intracranial pressure). Gait changes, coordination disorders. Regression or delay in psychomotor development. Increased tendon reflexes and increased muscle force due to the influence of the pyramidal system. Physical development disorders: obesity, early or delayed puberty; Young and middle-aged adults: The average adult produces about 500ml of cerebrospinal fluid daily. Therefore, when an injury causes the cerebrospinal fluid to not circulate, there is a risk of death. Some common symptoms of illness in this age group include: Headaches, fatigue, loss of balance, ineffective bladder function, frequent urination, vision problems and memory loss , ability to concentrate.; In the elderly: For people 60 years of age and older, hydrocephalus can cause symptoms such as urinary incontinence, frequent urination, weakness, memory loss, loss of ability to concentrate, reason, or walk. difficulty and poor balance.",
