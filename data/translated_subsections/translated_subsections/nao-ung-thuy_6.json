Additional tests such as ultrasound (if the patient is a newborn), CT scan (CT or CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be ordered. Tests can provide useful information about the severity and possible causes of hydrocephalus.\nCT scan: Computed tomography scans are used to help diagnose hydrocephalus in adults and children. Tomography uses X-rays to create images of cross-sectional slices of the brain. If the image shows that the ventricles are enlarged due to a lot of cerebrospinal fluid, it can be used to diagnose the disease.; Ultrasound: This method can be used to observe any images, however ultrasound is indicated in cases where the child's fontanel is still open.; MRI scan: This method is indicated to look for signs of excess cerebrospinal fluid.; Lumbar puncture: This is a meaningful method in diagnosis and treatment, helping to predict diseases of the central nervous system.; Measure and monitor intracranial pressure: Increased intracranial pressure can come from hydrocephalus. In case intracranial pressure is too high, doctors can conduct cerebrospinal fluid drainage to maintain oxygen levels. Brain.; Ophthalmoscopy: This is an examination procedure to observe the internal structure of the eyeball. This procedure can detect diseases of the vitreous, retina, and nerves.",
