The cause of cerebrospinal fluid obstruction can be treated directly (by removing the cause), or indirectly (by moving the fluid to another location, usually to a body cavity). Indirect treatment is done by implanting a device called a shunt to redirect excess cerebrospinal fluid away from the brain. The body cavity for the transfer of excess cerebrospinal fluid is usually the peritoneal cavity (the area surrounding the abdominal organs).\nIn some cases, two stages are performed:\nFirst stage to divert cerebrospinal fluid.; Later stages to remove the cause of the blockage (for example, removing a brain tumor).\nOnce inserted, the shunt system usually remains in place throughout the patient's lifetime (although surgical revision of the shunt system is sometimes necessary). The shunt system continuously performs the function of transferring cerebrospinal fluid away from the brain, so intracranial pressure is kept within normal limits.\nAn alternative type of surgery called endoscopic third ventriculostomy uses a flexible endoscope with a small camera to look inside the ventricular system, allowing surgeons to creates a new pathway for cerebrospinal fluid flow.",
