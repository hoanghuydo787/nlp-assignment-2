    "subsection_content": "Unilateral hearing loss is the ability to hear in one ear worse than the other ear. Patients may have congenital hearing loss in one ear, which develops suddenly or gradually from mild to severe.\nThe most serious level of this pathology is deafness in one ear. Single-sided deafness (SSD) is sensorineural hearing loss in one ear, so severe that it is clinically impossible to hear. This disease is defined by severe to profound hearing thresholds with poor sound recognition ability.(1)\nDoctor Thuy Hang said that although the nature of unilateral deafness is idiopathic, diseases such as cochlear abnormalities, temporal bone injury, Meniere's disease, vestibular schwannoma, vascular ischemia, Autoimmune disorders and infections... are often known to cause hearing loss in one ear.",
