    "subsection_content": "According to Dr. Thuy Hang, loss or impairment of hearing in one ear can stem from the following causes.(2)\n1. Earwax\nEarwax has the function of protecting the ear from dirt and insects and it can also clean the ear itself. Normally, the earwax will be pushed out, but there are also cases where it gets stuck for some reason. This causes a blockage that reduces the ear's ability to hear.\n2. Ear infection\nEar infections caused by bacteria or viruses can cause hearing loss. Otitis media is the most common type of infection that leads to hearing loss in one ear.\n3. Perforated eardrum\nInfections, too loud sounds such as bomb explosions, improper ear cleaning... can also rupture the eardrum, leading to poor hearing or deafness.\n4. Meniere's disease\nMénière's disease is an ear disorder that can lead to hearing loss, typically in one ear. When suffering from Ménière's disease, the patient not only has hearing loss in one ear but may also experience symptoms such as dizziness, tinnitus or a feeling of fullness in the ear.\n5. Abnormal bone growth in the ear\nIn very rare cases, abnormal growth of fibrous foci in the ear can cause hearing loss. This condition, called otosclerosis, becomes more severe over time and can affect one or both ears.\n6. Tumor\nAcoustic schwannoma is a type of tumor that presses on the nerve, affecting hearing and can also cause hearing loss in one ear.\n7. Having some other diseases\nHave Reye syndrome, a rare disorder that occurs in children; Temporal arteritis: Inflammation and damage to the blood vessels in the head and neck; Vertebral artery stenosis causes poor blood flow to the hindbrain; Autoimmune disorders... can also be the cause of hearing loss or impairment in one ear.",
