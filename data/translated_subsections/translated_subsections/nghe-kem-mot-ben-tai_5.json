    "subsection_content": "1. How does hearing loss in one ear affect hearing?\nDr. Thuy Hang said that the brain uses both ears to determine the location of sound, while improving the range and level of hearing. If you lose hearing in one ear, it will make it difficult to determine the origin of the sound in the brain, specifically: (4)\nDifficulty hearing in noisy environments: The brain is responsible for selective listening, it tolerates meaningful sounds and filters out unhelpful noises. If you have hearing loss in one ear, this will be more difficult to do. In noisy environments, people with hearing loss in one ear may have difficulty focusing on other people's voices.; Difficulty hearing in noisy environments: The brain is responsible for selective listening, it tolerates meaningful sounds and filters out unhelpful noises. If you have hearing loss in one ear, this will be more difficult to do. In noisy environments, people with hearing loss in one ear may have difficulty focusing on other people's voices.\nDifficulty distinguishing how loud a sound is: The brain perceives loud sound more clearly when it is perceived through both ears compared to one ear. This is because the brain receives signals from nerves located in both ears and uses this information to process sound.; Difficulty distinguishing how loud a sound is: The brain perceives loud sound more clearly when it is perceived through both ears compared to one ear. This is because the brain receives signals from nerves located in both ears and uses this information to process sound.\nDifficulty performing multiple tasks: Due to all of the above, single-sided deafness increases cognitive pressure on the brain, leading to hearing fatigue. The more noise there is, the longer it takes the brain to focus on tasks. For example, the patient may forget what they are saying if they try to listen to others; Difficulty performing multiple tasks: Due to all of the above, single-sided deafness increases cognitive pressure on the brain, leading to hearing fatigue. The more noise there is, the longer it takes the brain to focus on tasks. For example, the patient may forget what they are saying if they try to listen to someone else.\n2. Can severe hearing loss in one ear (deafness in one ear) be cured?\nDr. Thuy Hang said that deafness in one ear is difficult to cure, but hearing function can only be restored by methods such as using hearing aids, cochlear implants or bone conduction hearing systems.\n“Hearing loss in one ear occurs in about 12-27/1,000,000 people around the world each year. This condition can have a sudden onset, leaving the patient extremely debilitated. If not managed well and measures are taken to restore hearing in the affected ear, in the long term it will affect social communication, ability to concentrate, and can especially cause cognitive decline in children. me\", Dr. Thuy Hang emphasized.\nDepartment of Otolaryngology, Tam Anh General Hospital is a unit that examines, diagnoses and treats in-depth diseases of the ear, nose and throat, including hearing loss in one ear. With a team of skilled and experienced experts and leading doctors, supported by the most modern system of medical examination and treatment equipment such as audiometry, vestibular function measurement... along with the combination Close cooperation in diagnosis and treatment between specialties. Diagnostic imaging, testing... helps provide professional, comprehensive, and highly effective treatment.\nWhen you have unusual hearing problems and think you may have hearing loss in one ear or deafness in one ear, you should contact an audiologist for a hearing test. Especially sudden unilateral hearing loss requires medical treatment as soon as possible.",
