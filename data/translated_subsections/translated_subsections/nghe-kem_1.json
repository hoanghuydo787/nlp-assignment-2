    "subsection_content": "Hearing loss can appear at any age, however, the older you are, the higher the risk of hearing loss. About 80% of hearing loss occurs in older people. For people from the age of 60 onwards, there are few people who do not have hearing loss or whose hearing ability has not decreased compared to when they were young. In addition, hearing loss also occurs in children and people who work in noisy environments...\n1. Elderly people\nHearing loss affects more people over the age of 55-60 years old. However, hearing loss can appear after age 30, then every 10 years, the level of hearing loss gradually increases. The reason is that as people age, their organs will age, including the auditory nerve, which will also age or be completely destroyed. This leads to a decrease in the ear's ability to receive and transmit information, thereby causing hearing loss.(5)\nPeople working in noise environments: According to research, the dangerous sound intensity for the ears is from 85 decibels. Therefore, any loud sound with high intensity and prolonged duration can cause damage to structures in the ear, leading to hearing loss. People who work in noisy environments will suffer from hearing loss. Typically: Miners, carpenters, quarrymen, welders, builders, train drivers, people working in factories.\nLearn more about the causes, signs and treatments for hearing loss and hearing loss in the elderly.\n2. Sick people\nHearing loss is partly caused by diseases affecting the ears, especially related to infants and young children with ear infections and nasopharyngitis with ear complications. Typically, otitis media, inner ear inflammation, and meningitis. Research in the UK confirmed that among 432 children with meningitis in the UK, 59 children (13.7%) had hearing loss, of which 46 children (78%) had permanent sensorineural hearing loss, the remaining children had hearing loss. sensorineural deafness or unstable deafness. In addition, people with cardiovascular diseases, blood pressure and diabetes also have hearing loss because these diseases can obstruct blood flow to the ears.\n3. People have to take medicine\nSome medications have side effects that cause tinnitus, which can lead to hearing loss. In addition, drugs used to treat tuberculosis, cardiovascular disease, and cancer also have the effect of causing hearing loss in long-term users.\n4. People with injuries\nPeople with head and ear injuries can cause temporary or permanent hearing loss. Head trauma will cause perforation of the eardrum, fracture of the temporal bone and affect the structure of the inner ear, which can lead to hearing loss. However, hearing loss due to head injury is often detected late.",
