    "subsection_content": "1. Hearing loss due to genetics\nGenetics is currently the leading cause of congenital hearing loss in children. Statistics show that about 50% of all cases of congenital hearing loss are due to genetics. There have been a number of studies that confirm that families with a parent who has hearing loss have a higher chance of having a hearing loss than other children.(2)\n2. Complications when the mother is pregnant\nMothers suffering from certain infections such as Rubella and syphilis during pregnancy can cause hearing loss or deafness in the children they give birth to. In addition, mothers taking drugs during pregnancy such as aminoglycosides, cytotoxics, antimalarial drugs and diuretics have the risk of causing congenital hearing loss. In addition, premature babies with low birth weight are also in the group of children with hearing loss due to pregnancy complications.\nEar infection, abnormal bone growth or tumor: If you have an ear infection, have an abnormal tumor in the outer or middle ear, or any complications of abnormal bone growth can also cause hearing loss.\n3. Perforated eardrum\nLoud explosion, sudden change in pressure, poking the eardrum with a sharp object. Infectious ear infections cause perforated eardrums.\n4. Earwax accumulation\nEarwax can block the ear canal and prevent the transmission of sound waves, thereby causing hearing loss.\n5. Medicine\nParticularly, antibiotics used to treat infections can affect the cochlea and vestibule such as gentamicin, streptomycin, and tobramycin. These drugs can kill bacteria but also cause hair cell death, thereby causing hearing loss.",
