    "subsection_content": "Simulates the structure of the human ear\n1. Conductive hearing loss\nUsually the result of damage to the outer and middle ear. At that time, the sound transmission system including the earlobe, ear canal, eardrum and ossicles is damaged, so it no longer has the function of transmitting sound from the outside to the inside.\n2. Sensorineural hearing loss\nThis is a phenomenon in which the conduction organs function normally but the inner ear is seriously damaged. From there, the sound transmitted to the ears is not received and does not send information to the brain. This disease is often caused by damage to the cochlea, commonly found in the elderly, people working in noisy environments, and congenital deafness.\n3. Mixed hearing loss\nA mixture of conductive hearing loss and sensorineural hearing loss. Patients will suffer damage to many locations such as the outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear.",
