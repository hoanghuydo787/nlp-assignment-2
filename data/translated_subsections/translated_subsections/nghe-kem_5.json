    "subsection_content": "Currently, methods to restore hearing for patients depend on the cause of the phenomenon. For example, a normal person's sudden hearing loss may be due to a lot of earwax. Just removing the earwax will restore hearing. People with perforated eardrums can have surgery to repair the eardrum, however, according to Doctor Tran Thi Thuy Hang - Head of Ear, Nose and Throat Department - Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, there are also many patients with sensory organ degeneration. In the inner ear, a cochlear implant is required to regain hearing.(3)\nEarwax removal: By suction or a small tool with a ring on the end. Surgery: Surgery includes eardrum repair and ossicular chain correction. If the patient has repeated infections with persistent fluid, the doctor may insert a tympanostomy tube to help the ear drain fluid. Hearing aids: If hearing loss is due to inner ear damage, hearing aids will be helpful. Cochlear implant: Unlike hearing aids that amplify sound and direct it into the ear canal, cochlear implants help replace the function of damaged parts and directly stimulate the auditory nerve . This method was born in the 70s and has been widely deployed since the 90s. In Vietnam in the early 2000s, it was deployed in many hospitals. In particular, Tam Anh General Hospital applies modern equipment to cochlear implants, hearing loss treatment after ear surgery, achieving high efficiency in supporting patients to recover hearing after surgery. ; Earwax removal: By suction or a small tool with a ring on the end.; Surgery: Surgery includes eardrum repair and ossicular chain correction.
