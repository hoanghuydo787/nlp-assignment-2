Need to screen and test hearing function\nCurrently, Vietnam is among the countries with a high frequency of hearing loss but it is detected late due to not being screened for timely detection. With the development of medicine, it is now possible to measure ear function to check whether a patient has hearing loss or not, how severe it is, and what the cause of hearing loss is.

Screening for hearing loss in children\nAccording to statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2020, more than 5% of the population will have hearing loss, of which children account for 9%.

Wear headphones properly\nPupils, students, and office workers should limit wearing headphones that play loud music. When wearing headphones, you should wear them at a moderate level. You should let your ears rest after a period of wearing headphones.\n5. Need ear protection\nWhen living or working in places that are too noisy or loud. We can use noise-canceling earplugs.\n6. Regularly examine and test your hearing\nAccording to research, after the age of 30, hearing will begin to decline, then every 10 years, hearing will decrease by one level. Regular hearing tests are needed to ensure hearing ability, performed for both adults and children.\nSee more hearing testing methods for children at Tam Anh General Hospital.\nTo get a hearing examination, you can go to Tam Anh General Hospital System at the contact address: - Hanoi 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Bo De Ward, Long Bien District, City.
