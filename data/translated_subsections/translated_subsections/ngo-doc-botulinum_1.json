    "subsection_content": "Botulinum toxin is a protein produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. This is the most powerful deadly poison ever known, the lethal dose when injected is about 1.2-1.3 ng/kg and 10-13 ng/kg when inhaled. Under hypoxic conditions, C. botulinum bacteria produce spores and then excrete toxins. There are 7 main types of Botulinum toxin,  designated: A, B, C, D, E ,F, G; Of which 4 groups A, B, E and F (rare) cause disease in humans. (first)\nC. botulinum bacteria do not grow in acidic conditions (pH less than 4.6), so toxins are not formed in acidic foods. However, even lower pH levels do not decompose any previously formed toxins. Food preservation methods that combine low temperature, salt content and/or appropriate pH will help prevent bacterial growth as well as the formation of toxins.\nBotulinum toxin has been found in many foods, including vegetables stored in low-acid environments such as green beans, vegetables, mushrooms and beets, canned foods, fermented fish, salted fish and smoked meats, and meat products such as ham and sausages.",
