    "subsection_content": "Botulinum poisoning is a serious illness, with symptoms that may include drooping eyelids and abnormalities involving the muscles of the face, eyes and throat. Bacteria produce toxins (toxins) that attack the nervous system, causing muscle weakness and paralysis. If left untreated, botulinum poisoning can be fatal. (2)\nThe most common types of botulinum poisoning include:\nFood poisoning: occurs when a patient eats food contaminated with Clostridium botulinum spores. When food is stored improperly, bacteria can grow. When bacteria grow, they release toxins into food. Food poisoning often occurs when home-made canned food is due to improper preservation or storage or businesses that do not ensure food safety. Other sources of food poisoning include:\nOil infused with herbs. Potatoes baked in foil. Canned cheese sauce. Bottled garlic. Canned tomatoes. Carrot juice. Food is kept warm or not stored in the refrigerator.; Oil infused with herbs.; Potatoes baked in foil.; Canned cheese sauce.; Bottled garlic.; Canned tomatoes.; Carrot juice.; Food is kept warm or not stored in the refrigerator.; Infant botulism: occurs when babies ingest Clostridium botulinum spores. These spores develop into bacteria, colonize the child's intestines and release disease-causing toxins. Honey contaminated with spores is also the cause of illness in some cases. This is why doctors advise against giving children honey before they are at least 1 year old.\nWound poisoning: rare, when Clostridium botulinum spores enter an open wound, they grow and release toxins into the blood. Wound poisoning can occur in people who inject drugs. In some cases, the toxin develops after surgery or serious injury.\nTreatment-induced poisoning: occurs when a patient is injected with an overdose of botulinum toxin to treat wrinkles and migraines. Beauty treatments - Botox injections to remove wrinkles leading to Botulinum poisoning are very rare. And it's best for women to only get Botox injections when prescribed by dermatologists - cosmetic specialists, at reputable, licensed hospitals/facilities.\nWhen food is stored improperly, bacteria can grow and release toxins into the food.",
