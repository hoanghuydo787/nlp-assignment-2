    "subsection_content": "There are many different types of rat poison on the market, so depending on the type of rat poison each victim is poisoned with, the symptoms will be different. (2)\n1. Thallium\nThis is an odorless, tasteless powder that is absorbed through the respiratory tract or through the skin. Thallium exposure at high levels results in acute poisoning with the following symptoms:\nAcute enteritis (within 48 hours).; Neurological dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, epilepsy.; Hair loss.; Increased skin pigmentation.\nLong-term exposure to low concentrations of thallium will lead to chronic poisoning with symptoms such as:\nTremor, ataxia, muscle weakness; Astigmatism.; Paralysis of the 7th nerve (hemifacial paralysis, mouth distortion).; Reduced vision.\n2. Sodium fluoroacetate (Compound 1080) and fluoroacetamide (Compound 1081)\nThis rat-killing chemical began to be used in the early 1990s in Vietnam, smuggled from China.\nSMFA is an odorless, tasteless white powder. After 30 minutes to 20 hours of eating, symptoms will begin to appear.\nWithout urgent emergency treatment and aggressive treatment, the patient will quickly have convulsions, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, kidney failure, arrhythmia, acute heart failure, ... and death.\n3. Strychnine\nThe tablet form is pink but when dissolved in water it becomes a colorless, odorless, bitter powder. Strychnine toxicity with involuntary muscle contractions is due to inhibition of glycine receptors at the motor neuron and synaptic level. From 10 to 20 minutes after poisoning, symptoms will appear:\nUncontrolled muscle spasms; Stiff jaw; Spasm of the jaw and face, creating a forced smile; Opisthotonos (Head and spine arched backwards).; Rhabdomyolysis.; Lactic acidosis (too low pH in the blood).; Malignant hyperthermia.\n4. Zinc phosphide, aluminum phosphide\nZinc phosphide is a strongly corrosive substance to the skin and mucous membranes. When inhaled, it can easily cause acute pulmonary edema. Toxic dose: causes poisoning and death if acute poisoning with zinc phosphide 20 - 40mg/kg orally, aluminum phosphide ≥ 0.5g.\nMechanism of toxicity: When taking zinc phosphide and aluminum phosphide, the toxic gas phosphine (PH3) is produced when reacting between water and hydrochloric acid in gastric juice. Phosphine gas is a strong reducing agent, causing strong oxidative stress leading to non-specific cytotoxicity, binding and inhibiting enzymes of the cellular respiratory chain, inhibiting phosphorylation, oxidation, cytochrome oxidase. Phosphine also inhibits catalase, causing an increase in superoxide dismutase, creating many free radicals, lipid peroxidation, and denaturation of cell membrane proteins.\nPrognosis: If not urgently rescued and treated aggressively, the patient will quickly progress to irreversible shock, respiratory failure, acidosis, severe bleeding, damage to many organs and death. within a few days.\nSymptoms:\nHypotension: hypovolemic shock due to fluid loss, blood loss, myocarditis.; Electrolyte disorders due to vomiting and loose stools; Acidemia.; Acute kidney failure.; Progressive respiratory failure; Multiple organ failure.\nSome aluminum phosphide and zinc phosphide rat poisons\n5. Phosphorus (P)\nThis element smells of garlic and glows when exposed to oxygen, existing in two forms: red and white (yellow) phosphorus. White phosphorus is used in rat poison. When ingested, directly causes tissue damage with local phosphoric acid and phosphorus pentoxide. In the circulation, phosphorus also binds calcium leading to severe hypocalcemia. Poisoning with rat poison produced with phosphorus will cause conditions such as:\nAcute gastritis. Burns of skin or mucous membranes. Vomiting or feces (smoking stools). Arrhythmia. Liver toxicity. CKD.; Acute gastritis.; Burns of skin or mucous membranes; Vomiting or feces (smoking stools).; Arrhythmia.; Hepatotoxicity.; CKD.\n6. Arsenic\nArsenic is a highly toxic inorganic compound whose exact mechanism of action is still unknown. If a significant amount is swallowed, the patient's breath will emit a garlic odor. After 1 to 3 hours of arsenic poisoning, the following symptoms appear:\nVomiting.; bloody diarrhea; There is a smell of garlic in the mouth.; Low blood pressure.; QT prolongation (length of time between heart contraction and rest).; Delirium, convulsions, coma.; Kidney damage.\n7. Barium carbonate (BaCO2)\nThis compound is easily soluble in water and is highly toxic. Barium ion inhibits the diffusion of potassium out of cells leading to hypokalemia with symptoms:\nGastroenteritis.; Hypertension; Cardiac arrhythmia.; Short of breath.; Muscle paralysis.\n8. Tetramethylene Disulfotetramine (TETS, Tetramine)\nThis rat poison originates from China. Symptoms begin 10 minutes to 13 hours after poisoning with the following symptoms:\nConvulsion.; Comatose.; Respiratory failure.; Arrhythmia.\n9. Aldicarb\nThis type of rat poison originates from Latin America, and its high concentration can be deadly. Symptoms of Aldicarb poisoning include:\nFoaming.; Weep.; Diarrhea.; Vomit.\n10. Alpha-chloralose\nCompound originating from Europe, used as a veterinary anesthetic but also found in rat poison. The mechanism of action is similar to that of a central nervous system depressant, with symptoms:\nConvulsion.; Hypothermia.; Respiratory failure.\n11. Anticoagulants (Superwarfarin, Warfarin)\nSuperwarfarin (brodifacoum, difenacoum, bromadiolone and chlorophacinone) is a rat poison that causes coagulation disorders like warfarin but is 100 times more toxic. Poisoning with the rat poison Super Warfarin causes symptoms such as:\nBlood in urine; Hemoptisi; Epistaxis.; Flank pain.; Turning purple; Brain hemorrhage.\n12. Norbormide\nThis rat poison is essentially non-toxic to humans and acts through extreme peripheral vasoconstriction causing ischemia leading to organ necrosis followed by death of the animal. In humans, it causes symptoms of low blood pressure or low body temperature.\n13. Pyriminil\nPyriminil acts as a nicotinamide (vitamin B3 derivative) antagonist and impairs the synthesis of NAD and NADH, acutely destroying pancreatic beta cells within 2 hours. Symptoms of Pyriminil poisoning:\nKussmaul breathing (deep, heavy breathing).; Low blood pressure.; Leaden.\n14. Bromethalin\nThe rat poison Bromethalin affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Symptom onset ranges from 4 hours to 7 days from secondary delirium to severe cerebral edema.\n15. Sea onion\nThe toxic glycosides in sea onions are used to make rat poison and cause the following symptoms:\nStomach-ache.; Vomiting.; Convulsion.; Increased potassium in the blood.; Heart arrhythmia.",
