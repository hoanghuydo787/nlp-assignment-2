    "subsection_content": "Emergency doctors will diagnose victims of rat poison poisoning in the following ways:\nClinical diagnosis: The doctor asks the victim or accompanying person about the type of medicine taken, time (how long has it been since the poison was put into the body), symptoms, first aid, assessment of the condition, …\nPerform tests: If there is no exact conclusion about the toxicity introduced into the body, the doctor will perform a number of tests to determine the type of poison.\nBlood sugar: If the victim has hypoglycemia related to zinc zinc or aluminum phosphide. Hyperglycemia sign of pyriminil compound. Complete blood count test: Anemia is a sign of zinc phosphide poisoning. Metabolic function assessment (BMP): Hypocalcemia associated with white phosphorus, SMFA, fluoroacetamide. Hypokalemia can be due to barium carbonate, zinc or aluminum phosphide. If blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or creatinine is elevated there is a high possibility of thallium, arsenic, white phosphorus, zinc or aluminum phosphide poisoning.; Blood sugar: If the victim has hypoglycemia related to zinc zinc or aluminum phosphide.

Hypokalemia can be due to barium carbonate, zinc or aluminum phosphide. If blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or creatinine is elevated, thallium, arsenic, white phosphorus, zinc or aluminum phosphide poisoning is highly likely.\nQuantitative serum phosphorus test: If hyperphosphatemia is associated with rat poison made from white phosphorus.; Quantitative serum phosphorus test: If hyperphosphatemia is associated with rat poison made from white phosphorus.\nLiver function tests: Results concluded that elevated liver enzymes are related to toxins such as thallium, arsenic, white phosphorus, zinc or aluminum phosphate.; Liver function tests: Results concluded that elevated liver enzymes are related to toxins such as thallium, arsenic, white phosphorus, zinc or aluminum phosphate.\nBlood clotting test: To determine poisoning with rat poison containing Super Warfarin, Warfarin.; Blood clotting test: To determine poisoning with rat poison containing ingredients Super Warfarin, Warfarin.\nArterial blood gases: SMFA or fluoroacetamide lactic acidosis; Arterial blood gases: SMFA or fluoroacetamide lactic acidosis.\nReading electrocardiogram (ECG) results: If QTc prolongation, the victim is likely to be poisoned by one of the substances such as SMFA, fluoroacetamide, white phosphorus or arsenic.; Read electrocardiogram (ECG) results: If QTc is prolonged, it is likely that the victim is poisoned by one of the substances such as SMFA, fluoroacetamide, white phosphorus or arsenic.\nChest and abdominal X-rays: Identify contrast agents including barium carbonate, arsenic or thallium.; Chest and abdominal X-rays: Identify contrast agents including barium carbonate, arsenic or thallium.",
