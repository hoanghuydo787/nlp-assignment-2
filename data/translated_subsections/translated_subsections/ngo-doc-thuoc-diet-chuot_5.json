Emergency first aid\nEmergency first aid when detecting a person poisoned by rat poison is as follows: (3)\nStep 1: Observe the victim to determine poisoning with rat poison through signs such as bad chemical breath, difficulty speaking, difficulty breathing, etc. And determine by nearby medicine bottles and shells (if any). ; Step 2: Take the victim to a safe area.; Step 3: Perform simple first aid if you have knowledge about first aid for rat poison poisoning.; Step 4: If the victim is awake, you need to collect information, take pictures or bring rat poison.; Step 5: Call an ambulance and take the patient to the nearest hospital.\nBased on the condition and route of exposure to rat poison, perform appropriate first aid:\nDrinking rat poison: If the victim shows signs of vomiting, tilt his head to one side to avoid choking. After providing first aid, quickly take the victim to the nearest hospital. In addition, do not arbitrarily induce vomiting if the victim is lethargic, unconscious or convulsing or is unclear about the mechanism of rat poison (Sodium fluoroacetate and fluoroacetamide do not cause vomiting because of the risk of convulsions; Zinc phosphide, aluminum phosphide do not induce vomiting or gastric lavage at the hospital, etc.); Rat poison on skin or clothing: Clothing should be removed and washed immediately within 15 - 20 minutes.; If you get rat poison in your eyes: You should wash your eyes (when open) with clean water for 15 - 20 minutes, and contact lenses for 5 minutes (if any).\nAfter the initial first aid step, take the patient to the nearest medical facility or hospital for timely treatment. Avoid prolonging the treatment, causing serious, life-threatening complications.\nThings to remember when providing first aid for rat poison poisoning:\nRemember, the chemical name is on the packaging, bag or bottle. This helps doctors accurately identify chemicals faster and use specific treatment drugs promptly.; Remember the amount and duration of chemical exposure and initial symptoms and signs of poisoning; Do not put anything by mouth if the victim is unconscious.; Do not use any antidotes.; Observe the vomit, keep it in a bottle for testing.\nThe patient poisoned by rat poison was taken to the Emergency Department of Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City\n2. Treatment\nWhen arriving at the emergency room, victims of rat poison poisoning are treated by doctors as follows:\nEmergency treatment\nWhen the victim is brought to the emergency room, doctors will support the airway, circulation and breathing. In severe cases, an endotracheal tube will be required and a ventilator will then be needed. Next, the doctor will treat the symptoms of convulsions, drug shock, etc.  Then, perform tests to determine the poison such as blood and urine tests, chest and abdominal X-rays, and ECG ( electrocardiogram, or heart monitoring),…; When the victim is brought to the emergency room, doctors will support the airway, circulation and breathing.
