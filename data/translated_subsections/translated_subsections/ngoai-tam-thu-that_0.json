    "subsection_content": "Ventricular ectropion is a phenomenon in which the heart beats too early because the ventricles automatically beat, disrupting the heart's normal rhythm. A heart with ventricular extrasystole will have a normal beat, an extra beat, a slight pause, then a stronger than normal beat. The heart must take in more blood during pauses, creating more force for the next beat. This process can occur randomly or repeat with a determined frequency. (first)",
