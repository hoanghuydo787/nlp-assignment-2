    "subsection_content": "To diagnose ventricular extrasystoles, the doctor will need to ask information about symptoms, medical history, medications the patient is taking, and lifestyle. The examination includes taking a medical history and listening to the heart. After that, the doctor may order a number of additional important laboratory tests to diagnose ventricular extrasystole, including: (4)\nElectrocardiogram (ECG or EKG): This is a paraclinical test that records the electrical activity of the heart, showing whether the heart is beating too fast or too slow. The electrocardiogram recording process usually only lasts a few minutes and does not cause pain or discomfort to the patient.; ECG 24-48 hours: Some patients will be prescribed continuous ECG monitoring at home to increase the ability to detect ventricular extrasystole, especially cases that occur infrequently. The patient will wear a continuous electrocardiogram monitoring device for 24-48 hours or longer. The information will then be compiled and analyzed by doctors to make the most accurate diagnosis.; ECG stress test: You are asked to walk on a rolling mat parallel to the continuous ECG measurement. This test often helps detect certain exercise-related arrhythmias.\nPatients undergo electrocardiographic stress testing when ventricular extrasystole is suspected",
