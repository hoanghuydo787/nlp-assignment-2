    "subsection_content": "Most patients with mild ventricular extrasystoles with few symptoms usually do not require treatment. However, patients need to be periodically re-examined to monitor the progression of the disease. On the other hand, patients with multiple ventricular extrasystoles, severe symptoms, or ventricular extrasystoles due to severe heart disease will require treatment. In the case of treating this ventricular extrasystole, the doctor may use some drugs to slow the heart rate or antiarrhythmic drugs. In many cases when the patient does not respond to medication or does not want to take medication, doctors can perform intervention to eliminate the rhythm generator in the ventricles through high-frequency radio waves with a fairly high success rate.\nIn all cases, patients are recommended to change their lifestyle, rest to reduce stress, and stay away from tobacco, alcohol and stimulants.",
