Snoring is the result of vibration of the soft tissues of the nasopharynx caused by airflow, especially the soft palate. As in any other structure, vibration in the nasopharynx develops depending on interacting factors, including mass, muscle strength and associated neck structures as well as the velocity and direction of air flow.\nThe fact that a person does not snore while awake suggests that sleep-induced muscle relaxation may be part of the cause of snoring. Because muscle tone is the only component of vibration that can change during sleep, while tissue volume and associated structures do not change.\nWhen muscle tone is reduced, the airways cannot be kept open in response to the negative pressure in the lung caused by inhalation, and the upper airway narrows. This will increase local airflow velocity (for a given inhaled volume), thereby promoting wheezing and snoring.\nSnoring is more likely to occur in airways that have been damaged by structures, including:\nSmall chin, receding chin;; Deviated nasal septum;; Fat;; Big tongue;; Nasopharyngeal tumor.",
