Due to primary snoring\nPrimary snoring is snoring that is not accompanied by awakening or excessive arousal, but causes airflow restriction, oxygen desaturation, or arrhythmia during sleep. It even occurs in people who are not sleepy during the day.\n2. Due to breathing disorders during sleep\nSnoring is often a symptom of sleep-disordered breathing, which ranges from obstructive upper airway syndrome to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Each type has similar upper airway obstruction pathophysiology but differs in the severity and consequences of airway obstruction. The consequences are mainly related to sleep disorders.\nPatients with obstructive sleep apnea have ≥5 episodes of apnea or hypopnea (with each episode lasting at least 10 seconds) per hour during sleep.\nApnea/hypopnea index [AHI]) accompanied by ≥1 of the following signs:\nDaytime sleepiness, unintentional sleepiness, restless sleep, fatigue or insomnia;; Waking up holding your breath, gasping for breath, or choking;; Bedmates often complain of loud snoring, interrupted breathing, or both while the patient sleeps.\nSleep apnea can be classified by severity:\nMild: 5 to 15 episodes/hour;; Average: 16 to 30 waves/hour;; Severe: >30 episodes/hour.\nObstructive upper airway syndrome may cause daytime sleepiness or other manifestations suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea. But with some episodes of apnea/hypopnea or oxygen desaturation and therefore does not fully meet the criteria for obstructive sleep apnea.\nAlthough snoring itself is not harmful to your health, obstructive sleep apnea can have consequences, such as high blood pressure, stroke, arrhythmia, kidney failure.\n3.
