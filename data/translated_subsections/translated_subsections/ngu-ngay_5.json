General measures\nSome general measures can be used to treat primary snoring. Their effectiveness has not been well evaluated, mainly because the perception of snoring is very subjective; however, some specific patients may benefit.(2)\nMeasures include:\nAvoid alcohol and sedatives in the hours before bed;; Keep your head high when sleeping, it is best to use a bed or body positioning devices such as a mattress or sleep in a side lying position;; Lose weight, avoid obesity;; Treat nasal congestion with decongestants and/or corticosteroid sprays.\n2. Wear an anti-snoring device\nThese devices should be fitted by specially trained dentists.\nSide effects include temporomandibular joint (TMJ) discomfort, misaligned teeth, and excessive salivation, but most patients respond well to treatment.\n2.1 Mandibular traction devices\nThis is the device most commonly used by snoring patients. It helps move the lower jaw and tongue forward relative to the upper jaw and thus increases the airway diameter during sleep. These devices can be adjusted incrementally after the initial installation to optimize results.\n2.2 Tongue retainer\nThis device uses suction to maintain the tongue in an anterior position.\nA recently developed detachable tongue muscle stimulator can be used during the day. This device helps improve tongue muscle function in patients with snoring or OSA.\n2.3 CPAP devices\nCPAP devices maintain constant positive pressure in the upper airways through a small mask applied over the nose or nose and mouth. By increasing the size of the upper airway, CPAP prevents narrowing or collapse of the upper airway during sleep. Therefore, this device is very effective for OSA and effective for primary snoring.\n3. Surgery\nBecause decreased nasal ventilation promotes snoring, surgery can help correct specific causes of airway narrowing. They can be nasal polyps, tonsil hypertrophy, deviated septum...\nVarious pharyngeal surgeries that alter the structure of the palate and sometimes the uvula have been developed to treat obstructive sleep apnea. Some are also helpful for non-apnea snoring.\n3.1 Pharyngeal plastic surgery\nThis is a procedure under general anesthesia that involves reconstructing the uvula, nasopharynx, and pharyngeal wall to increase the size of the airway. Pharyngoplasty can be effective for snoring, but its effects are likely to be short-term, lasting a few years.\n3.2 Coblator and laser assisted surgery (LAUP)\nThis surgery is laser-assisted and less invasive than pharyngoplasty. It works to reduce the size of the uvula and soft palate to widen the airways.\n3.3 Plastic surgery with injections\nFor injection plastic surgery to treat scleroderma, medication is injected into the submucosa of the soft palate to reinforce and the uvula to reduce the size of the fatty tissue of the posterior pharyngeal wall and base of the tongue.\n3.4 Surgery to strengthen the palate\nA probe is used to apply heat energy to the soft palate and cauterize it. This method helps strengthen the soft palate to prevent it from narrowing the airway.",
