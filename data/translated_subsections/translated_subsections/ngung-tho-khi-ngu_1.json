    "subsection_content": "According to Diep Phuc Anh, M.D., Department of Otolaryngology, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, based on the mechanism causing sleep apnea, sleep apnea is divided into 3 types as follows.\n1. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)\nObstructive sleep apnea occurs when the upper airway becomes repeatedly blocked during sleep, reducing or completely stopping airflow. It is defined as a period of apnea or hypopnea >10 seconds, followed by arousal and hyperventilation.\nObstructive sleep apnea is the most common sleep apnea syndrome. Anything that can narrow the airways such as obesity, large tonsils, or changes in hormone levels can increase the risk of obstructive sleep apnea. Among them, obesity is the biggest cause leading to this syndrome.\nSymptoms may include excessive daytime sleepiness, restlessness, snoring, frequent awakenings, and morning headaches. Diagnosis is based on sleep monitoring and polysomnography.\nFor obstructive sleep apnea, treatment includes nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) oxygen, oral appliances, and, in refractory cases, surgery. The prognosis for treating obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is very positive.\nUntreated patients are at risk for hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and other arrhythmias. Heart failure and injury or death from motor vehicle accidents and other accidents caused by excessive sleepiness can also occur.(1)\n2. Central sleep apnea (CSA)\nCentral sleep apnea occurs when the brain does not send the necessary signals to breathe. Health conditions that affect how the brain controls the airways and chest muscles can cause central sleep apnea.\n3. Mixed sleep apnea\nA type of sleep apnea that includes both types above.",
