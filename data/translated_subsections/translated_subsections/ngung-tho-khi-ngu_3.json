    "subsection_content": "The causes of respiratory disruption differ between obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea.\n1. Causes of obstructive sleep apnea\nIn people with obstructive sleep apnea, the muscles in the back of the throat relax during sleep, narrowing the space for air to pass through.\nSnoring occurs when the airways are narrowed and blocked, not receiving enough oxygen. The lack of oxygen leads to partial or complete awakening of the brain to restore air flow. These breathing interruptions occur repeatedly during sleep.\n2. Causes of central sleep apnea\nCentral sleep apnea arises due to problems with the way the brain communicates with the muscles responsible for breathing. For people with CSA, a part of the brain called the brain stem does not properly detect carbon dioxide levels in the body during sleep. This results in repeated breathing episodes that are slower and shallower than necessary.",
