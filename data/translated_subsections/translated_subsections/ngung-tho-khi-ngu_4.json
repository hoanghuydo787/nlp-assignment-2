Factors and risks of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)\nThe main risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea are related to age, gender, body weight and certain anatomical features of the head and neck region.\nAge: The risk of developing obstructive sleep apnea increases with age until a person is in their 60s and 70s.; Age: The risk of developing obstructive sleep apnea increases with age until a person is in their 60s and 70s.\nGender: Men are more likely to have obstructive sleep apnea. Especially in the early stages of adulthood.; Gender: Men are more likely to have obstructive sleep apnea. Especially in the early stages of adulthood.\nHead and neck structure: Obstructive sleep apnea occurs more frequently in people with specific anatomical features including a larger tongue and shorter lower jaw.; Head and neck anatomy: Obstructive sleep apnea occurs more frequently in people with specific anatomical features including a larger tongue and shorter lower jaw.\nBody weight: Many studies have found a correlation between a higher body mass index (BMI) and the risk of obstructive sleep apnea.; Body weight: Many studies have found a correlation between a higher body mass index (BMI) and the risk of obstructive sleep apnea.\nSmoking: Some studies have found the risk of obstructive sleep apnea to be significantly higher in smokers than in people who have quit or never smoked.; Smoking: Several studies have found the risk of obstructive sleep apnea to be significantly higher in smokers than in people who have quit or never smoked.\nHormonal abnormalities: Hormonal conditions such as an underactive thyroid or overproduction of growth hormone can increase the risk of obstructive sleep apnea.; Hormonal abnormalities: Hormonal conditions such as an underactive thyroid or overproduction of growth hormone can increase the risk of obstructive sleep apnea.\nSleep position: Sleep apnea can progress or get worse when people sleep on their back. Because that sleeping position affects the shape and position of the tissue surrounding the airways.; Sleep position: Sleep apnea can progress or get worse when people sleep on their back. Because that sleeping position affects the shape and position of the tissue around the airway.\nFamily history of sleep apnea: There are some signs that a family history of OSA may increase a person's risk of obstructive sleep apnea. This inheritance may be related to anatomical features of the head and neck that are shared among family members.; Family history of sleep apnea: There are some signs that a family history of OSA may increase a person's risk of obstructive sleep apnea. This inheritance may be related to anatomical features of the head and neck that are shared among family members.\nNasal congestion: Difficulty breathing through the nose is associated with a higher likelihood of OSA.; Nasal congestion: Difficulty breathing through the nose is associated with a higher likelihood of OSA.\nUse of alcohol and certain drugs: Alcohol and some prescription and narcotic drugs are associated with a higher risk of obstructive sleep apnea.; Use of alcohol and certain drugs: Alcohol and some prescription and narcotic drugs are associated with a higher risk of obstructive sleep apnea.\nObesity increases the risk of obstructive sleep apnea\n2. Risk factors for central sleep apnea (CSA)\nCentral sleep apnea often occurs as a result of another medical problem. Such as infection or injury affecting the brain, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or overproduction of growth hormone.(2)\nStudies have identified several additional factors that are associated with a higher risk of central sleep apnea:\nAge: People over 65 years of age are at high risk for respiratory disruption consistent with central sleep apnea.; Age: People over 65 years of age are at high risk for respiratory disruption consistent with central sleep apnea.\nGender: Central sleep apnea is more common in men. This may be related to the levels of certain sex hormones.; Gender: Central sleep apnea is more common in men. This may be related to levels of certain sex hormones.\nUse of certain medications: Long-term use of opioid medications and some prescription medications can affect breathing and is associated with a higher risk of CSA.; Use of certain medications: Long-term use of opioid medications and some prescription medications can affect breathing and is associated with a higher risk of CSA.\nHigh Altitude: Prolonged work at high altitude is associated with CSA due to reduced oxygen availability; High Altitude: Prolonged work at high altitude is associated with CSA due to reduced oxygen availability.",
