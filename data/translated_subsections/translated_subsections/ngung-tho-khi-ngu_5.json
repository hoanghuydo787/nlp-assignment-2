    "subsection_content": "Sleep apnea must be diagnosed by an Ear, Nose and Throat physician or sleep specialist and several steps in the diagnostic process are required.\n1. Medical history and examination\nEvaluation of sleep apnea often begins with a review of the person's symptoms and overall health, as well as a complete physical examination. This is designed to detect signs of sleep apnea and identify risk factors that may contribute to the condition.\nAlthough testing is required to confirm that a person has OSA, the presence of symptoms may be what strengthens the diagnosis. It also helps your doctor determine the severity of the condition.\n2. Sleep test\nSleep testing is necessary to diagnose central or obstructive sleep apnea. Among them, polysomnography is widely used.\nDuring polysomnography, multiple sensors are used to monitor breathing, wakefulness, oxygen levels, muscle movements, sleep stages, and other aspects of sleep. An in-office sleep test can determine whether breathing is abnormal and distinguish between obstructive and central sleep apnea. For OSA, polysomnography may be performed over one or two visits to a sleep clinic.\nA home sleep test for obstructive sleep apnea was selected for selected patients with more severe OSA. Performing a sleep apnea test at home may be more convenient, but the results still must be interpreted by a specialist. However, home polysomnography is not used to diagnose central sleep apnea.",
