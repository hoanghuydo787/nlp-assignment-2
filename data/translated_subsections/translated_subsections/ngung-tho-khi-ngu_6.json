    "subsection_content": "Effective treatment can prevent or resolve serious complications from sleep apnea. On the contrary, if this condition is not treated, it can seriously affect the patient's health and spirit.\nSleep apnea reduces sleep quality. Poor sleep also reduces oxygen levels in the body.\nAccordingly, obstructive sleep apnea is associated with the risk of many health problems, including:\nTraffic accidents due to drowsiness or falling asleep while driving;; Cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, stroke, heart failure, heart disease and abnormal heart rhythm;; Metabolic disorders include type 2 diabetes;; Pulmonary hypertension puts excessive strain on the heart;; Thinking problems such as impaired memory and concentration;; Mood disorders including irritability and higher risk of depression;; Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is an increase in fat buildup in the liver that can contribute to serious liver damage;; Increased risk of complications related to anesthesia during surgery.\nIn central sleep apnea, possible complications depend largely on the underlying condition causing the breathing disorder.",
