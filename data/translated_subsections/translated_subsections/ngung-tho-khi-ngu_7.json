    "subsection_content": "MSc.BSc.CKI Diep Phuc Anh said that the goal of treating sleep apnea is to reduce respiratory interruptions and improve sleep. The treatment approach will differ between obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea.\n1. Treatments for obstructive sleep apnea\nPAP therapy\nPositive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is the treatment for most people with obstructive sleep apnea.\nPAP therapy keeps the airway open with pressurized air pumped from the machine through a hose and mask worn over the face.\nThis therapy should only be performed as prescribed by your doctor. Their air pressure must be adjusted based on the results of the polysomnogram.\nOne common type of PAP therapy is the use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device to deliver a stream of air that is always set at the same pressure level. Other types of PAP devices, such as bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and auto-titrating positive airway pressure (APAP) will provide changes in the amount of air pressure.(3)\nSome jaw or tongue immobilizers\nObstructive sleep apnea occurs when the soft tissues of the head or neck, especially around the mouth and jaw, press down on the windpipe. Special devices can help hold the jaw and tongue in a position that does not put pressure on the windpipe. This method is often applied to patients with mild to moderate sleep apnea.\nAlthough these oral appliances do not improve breathing as much as PAP therapy, they can reduce snoring.\nSurgery\nSurgery to remove tissue in the throat and widen the airway may be a treatment option for patients whose tissue is blocking the airway. Another method of implanting a device to stimulate the nerves that control breathing can also be done.\nFactors that help treat obstructive sleep apnea\nMSc.BSc.CKI Diep Phuc Anh said that in addition to the above methods, patients with obstructive sleep apnea should change their lifestyle to help control symptoms, specifically:\nLosing weight;; Regular exercise, which can help reduce OSA symptoms;; Change sleeping position, avoid lying on your back;; Abstain from alcohol and tobacco.\n2. Treatments for central sleep apnea\nTreatment for central sleep apnea often focuses on addressing the problems that cause abnormal breathing. If your sleep disruption is mild, your doctor may proceed to treat the underlying cause.\nHowever, if central sleep apnea symptoms are persistent or severe, the patient may need additional treatment to improve breathing in addition to addressing the underlying problem. This may include the use of PAP devices to promote more steady breathing during sleep. Other possible treatments include supplemental oxygen therapy or the use of medications that can increase a person's breathing rate.\nUse an assistive device while sleeping to prevent the risks caused by sleep apnea",
