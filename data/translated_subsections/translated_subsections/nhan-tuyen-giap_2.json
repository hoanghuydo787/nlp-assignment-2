    "subsection_content": "The thyroid nodule can be a thyroid cyst - a benign thyroid nodule, or a malignant thyroid nodule. Most thyroid nodules do not change thyroid function. However, some thyroid nodules can increase activity, produce an excess amount of thyroid hormone, causing hyperthyroidism with symptoms of weight loss, palpitations, tremors, muscle weakness, etc. Blood in the thyroid cyst will cause pain in the neck, jaw, and ears.\nA thyroid nodule that is large enough will cause compression of the airway or esophagus, which can cause difficulty breathing, swallowing, or throat irritation and coughing. In a few cases, thyroid nodules compress the laryngeal nerve, causing hoarseness, but it is often related to thyroid cancer.",
