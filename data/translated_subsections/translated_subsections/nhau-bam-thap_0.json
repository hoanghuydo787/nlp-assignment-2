    "subsection_content": "Low placenta or low placenta is a condition in which the placenta is not located at the bottom of the uterus, but part of the placenta is attached to the lower part of the uterus, close to the cervix. The nature of this condition is a type of placenta previa that is divided into 4 types based on anatomy as follows: (1)\nLow-lying placenta: is the placenta spreading to the lower part of the uterus but not reaching the internal os of the cervix; Placental attachment: is the edge of the placenta close to the edge of the internal os of the cervix; Incomplete central placenta previa: The placenta partially covers the internal cervical os; Complete central placenta previa: The placenta covers the entire internal cervical os.\nThe placenta plays an important role in providing the necessary nutrients for the fetus to develop. Normally the placenta is attached to the front, back or bottom of the uterus. However, in some cases, the placenta is located low near the internal opening of the cervix. On ultrasound, this distance is given as less than 2cm from the edge of the placenta to the internal os of the cervix, this is also the standard for diagnosing placenta previa on ultrasound.\nAccording to Dr. Duong Ngoc Hung, when the fetus is still young, the low-lying placenta can go away on its own as the fetus gradually grows and the mother's uterus grows toward the bottom, the placenta can be pushed higher. Therefore, low-lying placenta in particular or placenta previa in general is diagnosed when the gestational age is 28 weeks onwards.",
