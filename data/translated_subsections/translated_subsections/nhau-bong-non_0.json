    "subsection_content": "Placental Abruption is a dangerous obstetric complication that occurs when the placenta is attached to the right position but detaches prematurely before the fetus is ready to come out. Statistics show that this condition affects about 1% of pregnant women. This obstetric complication can occur at any time after 20 weeks of pregnancy, but is most common in the last 3 months of pregnancy (third trimester). (first)\nThe placenta is an important part, helping to connect and receive nutrients from mother to fetus. Normally, when the fetus is born, the placenta detaches to ensure continuous nourishment of the fetus. However, placental abruption causes the placenta to separate prematurely before the fetus is ready to be born, meaning the blood flow that nourishes the fetus has been cut off.\nDoctor Hoang Ngoc Anh, Doctor at the Center for Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, said that in placental abruption, the placenta can be partially or completely detached. When the placenta is separated from the uterine wall, there is no way to bring the placenta back, which can reduce the amount of oxygen and nutrition that nourishes the fetus, causing heavy bleeding in pregnant women. Therefore, this is a serious obstetric complication that requires immediate medical intervention.",
