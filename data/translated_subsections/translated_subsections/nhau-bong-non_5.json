    "subsection_content": "As mentioned, the placenta is an important organ that connects and receives nutrients from the mother to the fetus, ensuring that the fetus is continuously nourished until birth. When this condition occurs, the fetus can partially or completely lose oxygen and nutrients. If not intervened promptly, both mother and baby will face many dangerous complications. Detail:\nIn the fetus\nPremature birth: Means the fetus will be born before the 37th week. Statistics show that about 10% of premature babies are from mothers with placental abruption.; Developmental problems in children: Premature babies may have many health problems immediately after birth or at risk later; Stillbirth: This means the fetus dies in the mother's womb when the mother is at least 20 weeks pregnant.\nFetuses born to mothers with placental abruption may be born prematurely and have health problems\nIn pregnant women\nShock due to blood loss: This is a common complication in pregnant women with placental abruption, when blood is not passed through the placenta to nourish the fetus and is lost. Hemorrhagic shock occurs very quickly, more can accumulate in the uterus than flow out of the vagina. If not treated promptly, it can threaten the pregnant woman's life.; Blood clotting disorder: The disease can cause a lack of fibrinogenesis, leading to thin bleeding that does not clot after the fetus is delivered. If this condition lasts longer, it can cause more severe complications of blood clotting disorders, causing a lot of blood loss and endangering the life of the pregnant woman.; Due to lack of timely emergency treatment, hysterectomy may have to be considered to preserve the mother's life.\nIn addition, the disease is also the cause of many other dangerous complications such as hypertension, acute liver and kidney failure, adrenal insufficiency... Therefore, close monitoring of pregnancy and timely intervention and treatment of placental abruption is required. premature birth will help limit many dangerous complications, protect the health and life of pregnant women and fetuses.",
