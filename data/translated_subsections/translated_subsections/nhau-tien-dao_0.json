    "subsection_content": "The placenta is an organ formed inside the uterus during pregnancy, providing oxygen and nutrients for the developing fetus. Besides, the placenta also protects the fetus from impacts from the mother's body and the external environment. Therefore, placental diseases from the mother affect the health and development of the fetus while still in the mother's womb.\nThe placenta is round, about 15cm in diameter, weighs about 1/6 of the fetus's weight (about 400 - 500g), and is 2.5 - 3cm thick. Each placenta consists of 15 - 20 segments, between the segments are small grooves.\nThe placenta attaches to the wall of the mother's uterus and the fetus's umbilical cord, which is attached to the top, front, side, or back of the uterus. In a few cases, the placenta can attach to the lower uterus, even right above the cervix. When the placenta is low, it is a complication of placenta previa and can be dangerous for the pregnancy.",
