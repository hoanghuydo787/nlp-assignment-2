In a normal pregnancy, the placenta attaches to the front or back of the base of the uterus. (first)\nBased on attachment position, placenta praevia is divided into 4 types:\nLow placenta: The edge of the placenta is attached to the lower part of the uterus, not reaching the internal cervix;; Placental adhesion: The edge of the placenta reaches the edge of the internal os of the cervix;; Semi-central placenta previa: The placenta partially covers the internal cervical os;; Central placenta previa: The placenta completely covers the internal cervix, accounting for 20-30% of cases.",
