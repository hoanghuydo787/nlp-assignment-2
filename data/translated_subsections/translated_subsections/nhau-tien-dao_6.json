Depending on the gestational age, level of bleeding, ability to nourish the newborn as well as assessing the appropriate level of blood transfusion, doctors will prescribe prolonging the gestational age or cesarean section.\n1. For placenta previa when not in labor\nPregnant women need to rest, limit travel, and follow a diet supplemented with nutrients;; Use tocolytic drugs such as spasmaverine 40mg (1-4 tablets/day), salbutamol, progesterone;; Corticosteroids can be used to help the fetus's lungs mature early;; In case of full-term fetuses: Doctors may prescribe elective cesarean section in cases of central placenta praevia, but in other cases, consider monitoring until labor;; In case of heavy bleeding of the placenta, threatening the life of the pregnant woman: Perform a cesarean section at any gestational age.\n2. For placenta previa during labor\nIn case of central or semi-central placenta previa: Caesarean section;; In case of placenta adhesion: Emergency cesarean section if the pregnant woman has heavy bleeding. If the pregnant woman has little bleeding and the position and cervix are favorable: Perform amniocentesis and tear the amniotic membrane toward the side without the placenta to stop the bleeding. After tearing the amniotic membrane, if there is still bleeding, then perform a cesarean section. If there is no bleeding, then follow the vaginal route;; In case of low attachment of the placenta: Caesarean section if there is a lot of bleeding, if there is little bleeding or no bleeding, labor should be monitored;\n3. For complications of placenta accreta\nComplications of placenta accreta are considered the most severe clinical form of placenta previa, at which time blood vessels proliferate in the lower part of the uterus, penetrating the bladder, often in pregnant women with old cesarean section incisions. Therefore, the surgery is very difficult, there is a lot of blood loss and damage to the bladder.\nIn this case, an elective cesarean section is needed at full term.
