Furthermore, when entering the body, this larva also causes other health risks to humans in the parts where it resides.

When swallowing tapeworm eggs, the eggs will enter the intestines, 6-hook embryos are released, then penetrate the intestinal wall into the circulatory system, follow the blood vessels to locate and develop into cysts in parts such as the central nervous system.
