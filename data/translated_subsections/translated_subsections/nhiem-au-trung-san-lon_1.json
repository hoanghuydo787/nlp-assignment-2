Under the skin and muscles\nThere are often no symptoms or sometimes muscle pain, nodules under the skin can be felt, detected by X-ray when the cyst has calcified.\n2. Nervous system\nWhen they enter the central nervous system, they can cause neurological symptoms, including seizures. Pork tapeworm larvae are the cause of: 30% of epilepsy cases in epidemic areas when humans and free-ranging pigs live near each other; 70% of epilepsy cases occur in high-risk areas and affect approximately 50 million people worldwide.\n3. Eyes\nCysts can reside in the eyelids, eye sockets, conjunctiva... Depending on the location of the parasite in the eye, the patient has symptoms of blurred vision, double vision, decreased vision, and watery eyes. Detection of larval cysts in the eye by ophthalmoscopy.\n4. Brain\nDepending on the location of the parasite in the brain, people infected with tapeworm larvae have symptoms such as epilepsy, headaches, increased intracranial pressure, and mental disorders.",
