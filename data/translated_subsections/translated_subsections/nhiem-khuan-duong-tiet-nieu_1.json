    "subsection_content": "The urinary system coordinates with the lungs, skin, intestines... to maintain the balance of chemicals and water in the body. An adult eliminates about 800 – 2,000 ml/day based on daily fluid intake, equivalent to 2 liters.\nThe main organs of the urinary system are the kidneys, bean-shaped organs located just below the rib cage in the middle of the back. The kidneys are responsible for removing urea – waste formed by the breakdown of proteins – from the blood through small filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron consists of a ball formed of tiny blood capillaries, called a glomerulus. A small tube is called the renal tubule. Urea along with water and other waste products forms urine as it passes through the nephrons and down into the kidney's tubules.\nFrom the kidneys, urine travels down two thin tubes, called ureters, to the bladder. The ureter is about 20 - 25 cm long. The muscles in the ureter walls continuously contract and relax to push urine out of the kidneys, avoiding stagnant urine that can cause kidney infections. A small amount of urine is released into the bladder from the ureters about every 10-15 seconds.\nThe bladder is a hollow, ball-shaped organ located in the pelvis. It is held in place by a system of ligaments attached to other organs and the pelvis. The bladder stores urine until the brain signals it is ready to void. A healthy bladder can hold up to nearly half a liter of urine for 2-5 hours.\nTo prevent leakage, circular muscles, called sphincters, close tightly around the opening of the bladder into the urethra. The only difference between the female and male urinary systems is the length of the urethra. In women, the urethra is about 3.8-5.1 cm long, located between the clitoris and vagina. In men, the length of the urethra is about 20 cm, running the length of the penis and opening at the end of the penis. The male urethra is used to eliminate urine and also transmits semen during ejaculation. Due to the structure of the urinary system, women are at higher risk of urinary tract infections than men.",
