    "subsection_content": "Urinary tract infections typically occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract through the urethra and begin to accelerate growth in the bladder. Although the urinary system has been designed to keep these “invaders” at bay, defensive measures sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria will be retained and develop into inflammatory foci in the urinary system. (3)\nBladder infections or cystitis are often caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli), a type of bacteria found in the digestive tract. This condition occurs when bacteria are spread from the anus to the urethra. In addition, because the structure of a woman's urethra is close to the vagina, agents that cause sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) easily attack the urethra, causing inflammation.\nThe danger elements\nAs mentioned, urinary tract infections are common in women. Women-specific risk factors include:\nStructural characteristics of the urinary system: Shorter length of the urethra makes it easier for bacteria to move to the bladder causing infection; Sexual activity: Women who are sexually active tend to be more infected than women who are less active. At the same time, having a new sexual partner or multiple sexual partners also increases the risk of getting the disease.; Use birth control: Women who use diaphragms or spermicides may be at higher risk of developing urinary tract infections during pregnancy.; Menopause: The decline in estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract, making women susceptible to infections.; Childbirth period: Due to the characteristics of this process, women who give birth by cesarean section are more likely to have postpartum urinary tract infections than women who give birth naturally.\nOther risk factors\nCongenital abnormalities of the urinary tract: Abnormalities of the urinary tract prevent urine from escaping as usual or cause urine to reflux into the urethra, increasing the risk of infection.; Obstruction in the urinary tract: Kidney stones or prostate enlargement can also hold urine in the bladder and create opportunities for UTIs to appear.; Suppressed immune system: Diabetes and other diseases that weaken the immune system make people more susceptible to infections than others; Catheter use: People who cannot urinate on their own and use a catheter are at higher risk. This condition includes people who are hospitalized, people with neurological problems who have difficulty controlling their ability to urinate and are paralyzed.; Urological procedures: Urological surgery or urinary tract examinations that involve medical equipment can both increase the risk of developing a urinary tract infection.",
