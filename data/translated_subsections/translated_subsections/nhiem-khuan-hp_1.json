    "subsection_content": "The main route of H.p infection is from one person's mouth to another. H.p. can also be spread through the fecal-oral route, often occurring when sick people do not wash their hands thoroughly after going to the bathroom. Another possibility is that H. pylori is spread by consuming contaminated food or water.(3)\nH. pylori causes changes to the stomach and duodenum. The bacteria infect the protective tissues lining the stomach, leading to the release of certain enzymes and toxins and activation of the immune system. Combined, these factors can directly or indirectly damage the cells of the stomach or duodenum. This causes chronic inflammation of the wall of the stomach (gastritis) or duodenum (duodenitis). As a result of these changes, the stomach and duodenum are more susceptible to damage by digestive juices, such as stomach acid.\nH. pylori can infect a person's stomach during childhood. In the US or other developed countries, children infected with H.p. are not common. However, in countries with limited resources, most children are infected with H. pylori before age 10.",
