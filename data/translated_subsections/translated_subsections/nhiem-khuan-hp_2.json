However, when infection leads to gastric or duodenal ulcers, some of the following symptoms may appear:(2)\nPain or discomfort (usually in the upper abdomen); Abdominal bloating or distention; Feeling full after eating a small amount of food; Anorexia; Nausea or vomiting; Dark or tarry stools; Bleeding ulcers can cause anemia and fatigue.\nLess commonly, chronic gastritis causes abnormal changes in the stomach lining, which can lead to some forms of cancer. Although the rate of developing cancer due to H.p. infection is not high, because H.p. infection is a common condition, it is still considered an important risk factor for stomach cancer. People who live in countries infected with H. pylori as children have the highest risk of stomach cancer.",
