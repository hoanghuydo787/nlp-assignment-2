In addition, H.p. infection can also be detected through breath tests, blood tests and stool tests.\n1. Diagnosis of H. p infection by gastric endoscopy\nDoctors at Tam Anh General Hospital are performing a stomach endoscopy on a patient.\nThrough gastroscopy, the following tests for H. pylori can be performed:\nUrease test (Chlorine test): This is the most commonly used method today. Test results are available within 30 - 45 minutes.; Biopsy - Histology: It takes time to perform other in-depth methods to read tissue and cell structures and can also detect H.p. bacteria; Cultivate in a special laboratory environment, isolate bacteria, identify and conduct experiments on the sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics (called antibiogram). This method is often used in cases of repeated failure of H.p. treatment, or for research; PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction): Gene amplification technique. Usually used for research, rarely used in clinical practice.\n2. Other methods\nUrea breath test: Often called the HP balloon test, used to verify the effectiveness of H.p treatment, or in limited cases of endoscopy; Fecal Hp antigen (HPSA); H.p antibodies in serum: Often used in research, rarely used to diagnose current H.p. infection because of the ability of antibodies to persist in the blood for a long time.",
