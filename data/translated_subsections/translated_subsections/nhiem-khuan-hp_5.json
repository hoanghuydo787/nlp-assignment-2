    "subsection_content": "H. pylori infection is treated with medication\nIf H. pylori infection does not cause any problems and the infected person is not at high risk for stomach cancer, treatment may not be needed.\nHowever, in people with a history of peptic ulcer disease, advanced gastric ulcer disease, or duodenal ulcer disease associated with H. pylori infection, H. pylori treatment is necessary. Successful treatment of H. pylori can help ulcers heal, prevent ulcer recurrence, and reduce the risk of ulcer complications (such as bleeding).\nAdditionally, “patients who require long-term anti-inflammatory medications such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and similar medications for arthritis and other medical conditions should be tested for H. pylori, and if found Infection must be treated to destroy H. pylori bacteria,” said Dr. Thanh.\n1. Treatment regimen for H.p. infection\nMost current H.p treatment regimens include at least 3 drugs for 14 days:\nHp eradication regimens often use a type of drug called a proton pump inhibitor. This medication reduces the stomach's acid production, helping to heal tissues damaged by infection. Examples of proton pump inhibitors include: omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole.; Two types of antibiotics are also commonly recommended. This reduces the risk of treatment failure and reduces drug resistance. An increasing number of patients with H. pylori infections are resistant to antibiotics, so it is important to take all prescribed medications and have tests confirm that the infection is gone.(4)\nDr. Thanh emphasized that to effectively treat H. pylori, it is important to use the entire course of all medications. Patients should not arbitrarily stop taking medication or change the dosage because this will prevent the bacteria from being completely eliminated, causing drug resistance and drug resistance, making it more difficult to treat. If the patient wants to use additional medications or other treatment methods, they should consult a doctor before using.\n2. Side effects of treatment drugs\nAbout 50% of patients may experience some side effects when using the drug. However, there is no need to worry too much because they are usually mild and do not affect the treatment process. However, if these side effects cause discomfort, the patient can talk to the doctor to adjust the dosage or duration of medication.\nSome common side effects include:\nMetronidazole or tinidazole can cause nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, epigastric discomfort, flatulence, indigestion, constipation, and temporary taste changes. In particular, if the treatment regimen contains metronidazole, the patient should avoid drinking alcoholic beverages (wine, beer) because this combination can cause skin redness, headache, nausea, vomiting, sweating and heart palpitations. tachycardia.; Bismuth, found in some preparations, turns stools black and can cause constipation.; Many treatment regimens cause diarrhea and stomach cramps.\n3. Follow-up after treatment\nAfter completing treatment for H. pylori, the person will need to be tested again to ensure that the infection is completely gone. Normally, the patient will be tested with a breath test. Blood tests are not recommended to check for H.p. infection after treatment, because antibodies detected by blood tests often remain in the blood for four months or more after treatment, even if cleared. infection.\nStatistics show that up to 20% of patients still cannot completely eradicate H.p. after completing the first treatment, doctors will recommend a second treatment regimen in this case. The patient will take a proton pump inhibitor for 14 days and two antibiotics, including at least one antibiotic that is different from those used in the first treatment.",
