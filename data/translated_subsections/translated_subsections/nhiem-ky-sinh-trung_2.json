    "subsection_content": "Parasitic infections can be silent, or have warning signs, but can easily overlap with many common diseases. In addition, parasitic infections due to diverse types also have different manifestations. However, people infected with parasites may have the following symptoms:\nProlonged fever\nParasitic infections often have signs of prolonged fever, which can be high fever with body chills or can be fever for a short time and then stop. Sometimes fever is accompanied by abdominal pain, diarrhea, and loss of appetite.\nDigestive disorders\nDigestive disorders or symptoms of diarrhea, flatulence, and bloating are common signs in people infected with gastrointestinal parasites, but are easily confused with other intestinal diseases. Parasitic waste can cause constipation, bloating, and nausea in infected people.\nSymptoms of itching or hives\nParasitic diseases in humans will cause a number of skin problems such as red rashes, eczema, and allergies. In addition, waste from parasites accumulates in the skin, leading to swelling, skin damage, and inflammation over time.\nWeight loss, malnutrition\nParasitic infections affect intestinal activity. The patient's body is susceptible to symptoms such as constipation, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea. In addition, some parasite species suck blood and nutrients from the host, causing the host to lose weight and even become malnourished. .\nItching in the anal area\nAnal itching is a characteristic of people infected with worms, especially pinworms. Infected people often have itching around the anus at night, when female worms lay eggs.\nAnemia\nMost parasites, after entering the human body, will suck the host's blood to maintain life, grow and reproduce. Therefore, undetected parasitic infections can lead to anemia.\nPersonality changes\nIf infected with parasites, the patient's psychology will change to become anxious, insecure, and even affect the nerves through symptoms of poor concentration and memory loss.",
