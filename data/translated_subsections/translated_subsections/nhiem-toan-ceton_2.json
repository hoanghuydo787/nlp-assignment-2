    "subsection_content": "The two most common motivating factors are:\nHaving another illness: when sick, the patient does not eat and drink as much as usual, making blood sugar difficult to control. Not to mention, if the patient falls into an infection or becomes seriously ill, more hormones such as adrenaline or cortisol are produced. These hormones work against the effects of insulin, causing ketoacidosis more easily. Pneumonia and urinary tract infections are common illnesses that lead to ketoacidosis. (3); Insulin therapy: if a diabetic is prescribed insulin injections but for some reason forgets to inject or injects an insufficient dose or uses the wrong dose of insulin, it can lead to ketoacidosis.\nOther causes of ketoacidosis include:\nHeart attack or stroke.; Physical trauma such as a car accident or mental illness.; Abuse of alcohol or drugs, especially cocaine; Certain medications such as diuretics (water pills) and corticosteroids (treat inflammation in the body).; Pancreatitis.; Pregnancy.\nKetoacidosis is the accumulation of acid in a patient's blood.",
