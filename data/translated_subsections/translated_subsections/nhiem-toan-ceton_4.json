Some glucose meters also measure ketones. Try to lower your blood sugar and check your ketones again after 30 minutes.\nA physical exam and blood tests can diagnose ketoacidosis. In some cases, other tests are needed to find the cause of ketoacidosis.\n1. Blood test\nBlood tests used in diagnosing ketoacidosis:\nBlood sugar test: if the body is not provided with enough insulin to connect glucose into cells, blood sugar levels will increase - hyperglycemia. As the body breaks down fats and proteins for energy, blood sugar levels will continue to rise.; Ketone index: when the body breaks down fats and proteins for energy, acids called ketones enter the blood.; Blood acidity: ketone levels in the blood are too high, causing the blood to become acidic. This changes the way the body's organs work.\n2. Other testing methods\nDepending on the patient's health condition when admitted to the hospital, the doctor may prescribe a number of other tests to help find health problems and limit complications, including:\nBlood electrolyte test.; Chest X-ray.; ECG.; Arterial blood gases.; Blood pressure.; Test for signs of infection.\nPatients with ketoacidosis will be treated in the emergency room or hospitalized.",
