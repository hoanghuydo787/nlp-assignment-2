    "subsection_content": "Patients with ketoacidosis will be treated in the emergency room or hospitalized. Treatments for ketoacidosis include:\nRehydration: replaces fluids lost through frequent urination and dilutes excess sugar in the blood. Fluids may be given through the mouth or vein. In particular, IV fluids are given through a vein.; Electrolyte replacement: electrolytes are minerals in the blood such as sodium, potassium, chloride, which carry an electrical charge. Too little insulin will lower electrolyte levels in the blood. IV electrolytes are given to help the heart, muscles, and nerve cells function normally.; Insulin infusion: insulin reverses the conditions that cause ketoacidosis. In addition to fluids and electrolytes, insulin is given through a vein. Regular insulin treatment can be returned to when blood sugar levels drop to about 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) and the blood is no longer acidic.; Take medications for any underlying illness that causes ketoacidosis such as antibiotics to treat infections.\nPatients are closely monitored to detect any possible life-threatening problems such as brain, kidney or lung problems. Patients can be discharged from the hospital when they are well enough to eat and drink and tests show that the ketone level in the body is at a safe level. Before leaving the hospital, you need to understand the cause of ketoacidosis and how to prevent it.",
