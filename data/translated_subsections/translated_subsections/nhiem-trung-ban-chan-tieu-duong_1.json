    "subsection_content": "There are many causes of diabetic foot infection such as neurological complications, ischemia, nutritional dysfunction and infection. However, the main mechanism is due to lack of blood supply to diabetic feet. The disease can be caused by local damage or peripheral blood vessel damage. Peripheral nerve damage is a common complication of diabetes, appearing in about 50%-70% of cases. This damage affects sensory, motor and autonomic nerve fibers. Since then, the patient's feet are no longer sensitive to common painful stimuli. For the most part, ulcers often originate from small injuries, gradually damaging motor fibers causing muscle weakness, muscle atrophy and mild paralysis. Ultimately, the patient's feet become deformed, with increased pressure points appearing, causing calluses and thickening of the feet, combined with frequent walking, leading to tears and tissue inflammation, which gradually leads to foot ulcers. Peripheral nerve damage also causes the body to reduce sweating and change the skin's defense structure, so when outside microorganisms enter, the skin becomes dry and cracked, causing foot infections. (2)\nLimb necrosis due to vascular occlusion causing anemia: More than 30% of diabetic foot ulcer cases are related to peripheral vascular disease. Vascular changes are characterized by changes typical of atherosclerosis, the skin appears red - a factor that makes ulcers more susceptible to complications and difficult to treat.\nDiabetic foot ulcers create conditions for local or systemic infection and the risk of lower limb amputation. Amputation not only causes the patient mental crisis but also causes economic and social losses.\nDiabetic foot infection.",
