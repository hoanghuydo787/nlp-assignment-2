    "subsection_content": "In addition to peripheral nerve damage, peripheral vascular disease and infections, people with diabetes face foot infections due to a number of identified risk factors such as: microtrauma, structural deformities. structure, limited joint mobility, appearance of calluses, prolonged hyperglycemia, uncontrolled hyperglycemia, history of foot ulcers or amputation. (3)\nAbout 25% of people with diabetes will develop serious foot problems. If a person is diagnosed with diabetes, there is a high chance of developing a diabetic foot infection. However, there are additional activities that put people at higher risk of infection such as:\nStanding for long periods in cold and wet conditions will increase leg numbness and dry skin. Both of these increase the risk of infection.; Do not soak your feet, especially in Epsom bath salts, as this will increase the risk of infection.; Not wearing socks loses the opportunity to protect the skin of the feet.; Wearing uncomfortable shoes causes blisters; Not washing your feet regularly and thoroughly.; Drink beer.; Smoking inhibits blood circulation; Not cutting or cutting toenails incorrectly can cause skin tears.\nDiabetic foot infections are more common in people with heart disease, body disease, and eye disease (due to diabetes). Older men and obese people are more likely to get diabetic foot infections.\nOnce an ulcer forms, it is a race against time to heal before infection occurs. People with diabetes have a reduced ability to fight infections and nutritional deficiencies make treatment difficult.",
