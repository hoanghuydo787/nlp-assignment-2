    "subsection_content": "The incidence of diabetic foot infections is more common in elderly patients and people with other diseases. Both men and women are affected equally. The risk of death is higher in patients with chronic osteomyelitis or acute necrotizing soft tissue infections and underlying problems affecting the immune system. Therefore, patients need to treat diabetic foot infections early.\nAntibiotics: Most infections are treated with antibiotics to treat diabetic foot infections. The duration of antibiotic treatment is usually 2 - 4 weeks. People with osteomyelitis need at least 6 weeks of treatment.

The doctor will perform basic hygiene and treatment steps first, including: Clean the wound and surrounding area. Eliminates foot ulcers. Remove dead skin and potential foreign objects.
