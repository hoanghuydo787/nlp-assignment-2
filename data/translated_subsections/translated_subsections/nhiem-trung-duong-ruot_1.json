    "subsection_content": "Below are some typical causes of intestinal infections: (1)\n1. Bacteria cause intestinal infections\nCommon types of bacteria: E.coli, salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria, Bacillus cereus, Vibrio, Clostridium botulinum...\nE. coli: E. coli bacteria are found in the intestines of humans and animals, mostly harmless strains. However, some strains, such as ETEC, EPEC, EIEC,... have the ability to secrete toxins, causing abdominal pain, vomiting and bloody diarrhea. This group of bacteria is often spread through contaminated water, food in contact with animal feces, etc.; E. coli: E. coli bacteria are found in the intestines of humans and animals, mostly harmless strains. However, some strains, such as ETEC, EPEC, EIEC,... have the ability to secrete toxins, causing abdominal pain, vomiting and bloody diarrhea. This group of bacteria is often spread through contaminated water sources, food in contact with animal feces...\nSalmonella bacteria: Salmonella infection is often caused by eating undercooked poultry, meat, and eggs. Typical symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever, appear 12 - 72 hours after infection and take 4 - 7 days to recover.; Salmonella bacteria: Salmonella infection is often caused by eating undercooked poultry, meat, and eggs. Typical symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever, appear 12 - 72 hours after infection and take 4 - 7 days to recover.\n2. Viruses cause intestinal infections\nNorovirus: This is the most typical factor causing food-borne intestinal infections. Norovirus has the ability to spread between people in a limited space. Many cases are transmitted through contaminated water or food; Norovirus: This is the most typical factor causing food-borne intestinal infections. Norovirus has the ability to spread between people in a limited space. Many cases are transmitted through contaminated water or food.\nRotavirus: Rotavirus is the leading cause of intestinal infections in children worldwide. The main route of transmission is by touching objects contaminated with the virus and then touching your hands to your mouth without cleaning. Currently, some countries have vaccines available; Rotavirus: Rotavirus is the leading cause of intestinal infections in children worldwide.

Parasites cause intestinal infections\nTwo types of parasites that commonly cause intestinal infections include:\nGiardia: This is a parasite that causes intestinal infection, spread through person-to-person contact or contaminated water. Giardia is resistant to chlorine so it can still survive in public swimming pools.; Giardia: This is a parasite that causes intestinal infection, spread through person-to-person contact or contaminated water. Giardia is resistant to chlorine so it can still survive in public swimming pools.\nCryptosporidiosis: Cryptosporidium is a microscopic parasite with a solid outer shell, helping it survive on the host body and withstand chlorination.; Cryptosporidiosis: Cryptosporidium is a microscopic parasite with a solid outer shell, helping it survive on the host body and withstand chlorination.\nParasitic infections can last from 1 to 2 weeks or longer depending on the condition. Common symptoms include: bloating, abdominal cramps, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea... These signs usually appear clearly after 7 - 10 days of exposure. Accordingly, both types of parasites are often found in water and are infected after eating or drinking.\nIntestinal infections can be caused by bacteria, viruses or parasites",
