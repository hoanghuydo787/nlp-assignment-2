    "subsection_content": "Salmonella is a type of intestinal bacteria that does not form spores and mainly moves by flagella around the body. This group of chemotrophs mainly obtains energy from redox reactions, capable of generating ATP using oxygen when available or using electron acceptors or fermentation when oxygen is not available. (first)\nSalmonella is also a facultative intracellular pathogen that can invade a variety of cell types, including epithelia, M cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. The disease caused by this microorganism is called salmonellosis, causing gastrointestinal discomfort, fever, diarrhea and abdominal cramps.\nIn most cases, the disease comes from contaminated food sources (contaminated with human or animal feces) that sick people eat. Accordingly, salmonella strains can be divided into two main groups including typhoid and non-typhoid. The second group is often more common, can infect many types of animals and is transmitted directly from animals to humans.\nIn contrast, the typhoid group that includes Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A, B, and C occurs only in humans and does not occur in other animals. Non-typhoidal group caused by other Salmonella mainly causes enteritis and septicemia.",
