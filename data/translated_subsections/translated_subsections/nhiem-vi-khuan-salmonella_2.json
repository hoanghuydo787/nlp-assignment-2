    "subsection_content": "Salmonella bacteria live in the intestines of humans, animals and birds. Most infections are caused by consuming contaminated food or water containing feces. Specifically as follows: (3)\n1. Food and water contain sources of infection\nRaw meat, poultry and seafood: Feces can stick to poultry during the slaughtering process, and seafood can also be contaminated when living in polluted water.; Unpasteurized milk and milk products: Unpasteurized milk and milk products may be contaminated with salmonella. Meanwhile, pasteurization can remove harmful bacteria, including salmonella.; Fruits and vegetables: Fresh fruits and vegetables, especially imported varieties, can be contaminated with salmonella during the process of fertilizing or preparing and cleaning with water.; Raw or undercooked eggs: Although the eggshell protects the inside from contamination, infected birds can still lay eggs containing salmonella bacteria (which exist before the shell is formed). This is the source of infection when humans eat it.\n2. Improperly handled food\nMany foods are contaminated with salmonella bacteria due to unhygienic processing, mainly due to not washing hands thoroughly before preparing.\n3. Source of infection from pets and other animals\nAnimals in general, including pets, especially birds and reptiles, can carry salmonella bacteria on their fur, skin and feces. Therefore, this is also a source of infection that should be paid attention to.\n4. Risk factors\nDaily activities bring the body into closer contact with salmonella bacteria.; The body's ability to fight infections is weakened due to health problems.; International travel: Salmonellosis is more common in developing countries with poor sanitation. Therefore, tourists are also at higher risk of infection if they go to these countries.; Contact with animals: Some animals can carry salmonella bacteria, in addition, this type of microorganism is also easily found in cages, tanks, cages, and litter trays of pets.; Stomach or intestinal disorders: The body has many natural defenses against salmonella infection, such as strong stomach acid. However, some medical problems or medications can impair this ability, including antacids, antibiotics, immune problems, inflammatory bowel disease, etc.",
