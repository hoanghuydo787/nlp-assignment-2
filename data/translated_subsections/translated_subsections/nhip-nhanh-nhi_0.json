    "subsection_content": "Atrial tachycardia is an arrhythmia originating from the atria, defined as a fast heart rate caused by abnormal rhythm generators from the atria.\nIn the case of atrial tachycardia, the electrocardiogram usually shows a tachycardia with a narrow QRS complex (unless there is accompanying aberrant conduction). The disease often has a fast heart rate of 150-250 beats per minute. Atrial rhythm is usually regular. (first)\nIn atrial tachycardia, the upper floors of the heart (atria) may beat as fast or as fast as the lower floors (ventricles). Abnormal rhythm generators in the atria have a higher frequency than other normal rhythm generators (such as the sinus node) and therefore take over control of the heart rate, causing rapid heart beat.\nThey can appear in 3 ways:\nIncreased automaticity.; Initiation activities; Re-entry phenomenon.",
