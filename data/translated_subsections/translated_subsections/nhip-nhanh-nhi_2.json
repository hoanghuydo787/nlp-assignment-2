Unifocal atrial tachycardia\nUnifocal atrial tachycardia (often referred to as atrial tachycardia) is generated from a specific (focal) location in the heart and is usually less dangerous. However, this condition can still cause symptoms that affect health and quality of life, and even lead to long-term complications if not treated appropriately.\n2. Multifocal atrial tachycardia\nIn some cases, atrial tachycardia may have more than one source of rhythm, called multifocal atrial tachycardia. This type of atrial tachycardia may be easier to diagnose but more difficult to treat. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other serious medical conditions are common causes.",
