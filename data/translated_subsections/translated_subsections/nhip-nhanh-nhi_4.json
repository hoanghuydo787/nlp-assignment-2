    "subsection_content": "MSc.BS.CKI Vu Xuan Quang said that atrial tachycardia is different from atrial fibrillation.\nAtrial tachycardia usually causes the upper chambers of the heart to beat at 100-250 beats/minute. However, this number may be higher in children and infants. Although the heart rate is abnormally fast, it rarely interferes with the heart's ability to pump blood normally.\nAtrial fibrillation is very dangerous because it causes the upper chambers of the heart to beat at 350-600 beats/minute. When this happens, the upper part of the heart barely works, can't fill with blood, and doesn't pump all the blood already inside. This causes blood to pool, leading to clot formation. Blood clots that travel from the heart to the brain cause strokes or arterial embolisms in other organs where the clot travels.\nAtrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation are both dangerous heart diseases.",
