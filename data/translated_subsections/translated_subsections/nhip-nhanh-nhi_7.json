    "subsection_content": "Paraclinical methods used to diagnose atrial tachycardia include: (4)\nBlood tests: Check for thyroid disorders, heart disease, or other conditions related to atrial tachycardia.; Electrocardiogram (ECG): Measures the heart's electrical activity and heart rate, helping to accurately diagnose tachycardia; Holter ECG: A portable electrocardiogram monitor worn for a day or more to record the heart's electrical activity during daily activities. Echocardiogram: Checks the structure and activity of the heart.\nEchocardiography is one of the diagnostic methods.\nBesides, doctors can also diagnose atrial tachycardia using other methods, such as:\nStress test: Monitor heart activity when walking on a rolling mat or riding a bicycle with a dynamometer.; Electrophysiological study (EP study) and electrical mapping of the heart chambers: Allows doctors to examine electrical activity in the heart and determine the location of arrhythmias, often combined with ablation of arrhythmias.",
