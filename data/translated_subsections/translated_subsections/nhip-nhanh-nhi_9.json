    "subsection_content": "MSc.BSc.CKI Vu Xuan Quang said that depending on the type of atrial tachycardia, there are different treatment methods:\nUnifocal atrial tachycardia: Has a very high cure rate, especially when applying arrhythmia ablation techniques.; Multifocal atrial tachycardia: The disease is often caused by other serious medical diseases.\nTreatment is more difficult because there are many different arrhythmia foci in the heart. However, treating other diseases (which cause the condition) may resolve multifocal atrial tachycardia. If there are no symptoms and the atrial tachycardia only lasts for a short time, the doctor only needs to monitor the patient's condition in combination with adjusting accompanying medical diseases.\nIn some cases, especially those that last only a short time, atrial tachycardia may go away on its own.\nDoctors at Arrhythmia Unit, Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City perform arrhythmia ablation for patients.",
