    "subsection_content": "Ventricular tachycardia is a rapid arrhythmia that originates in the ventricles of the heart. There are many types of ventricular tachycardia, but they are often related to structural heart disease or coronary artery disease. Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation are the most dangerous arrhythmias and require aggressive treatment.\nThe disease is common in patients with structural heart disease, ion channel pathology of the heart or heart failure patients with reduced blood pumping function. In heart failure, coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy, many areas of the myocardium (and especially the left ventricle) may be thickened, dilated, lacking blood supply and reducing contractile function. (first)\nThe disease process can lead to damaged areas of the myocardium, fibrosis, and replacement of muscle tissue with scarring. Scarring and structural changes in the ventricles facilitate the induction and maintenance of ventricular tachycardia. There are also a number of diseases that cause abnormal electrical activity of the heart that can also cause life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias even though the heart's contractile function is still normal.\nVentricular tachycardia can originate from the left or right ventricle. MSc.BSc.CKI Vu Xuan Quang, Doctor at the Cardiovascular Center of Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, said that a person has a higher risk of ventricular tachycardia if they have one of the following factors: abnormal heart valves, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease.",
