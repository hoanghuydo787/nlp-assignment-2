    "subsection_content": "According to MSc.BS.CKI Vu Xuan Quang, ventricular tachycardia includes all types of fast arrhythmias, with frequencies above 100 beats/minute, originating from the ventricles. Ventricular tachycardia can be rapid and regular with uniform electrical waves, called monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. If it is fast and irregular, with many different wave shapes on the electrocardiogram, it is called polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.\nThe most severe form of ventricular arrhythmia is ventricular fibrillation with the electrical activities of the two ventricular chambers completely chaotic. At this point, the heart no longer beats but only \"vibrates\", and the patient will die very quickly if the ventricular fibrillation continues for a long time without timely emergency treatment.\nIdiopathic ventricular tachycardia\nSometimes ventricular tachycardia occurs in people without cardiovascular disease with a normal heart muscle (so it is called idiopathic). This form of ventricular tachycardia is usually easier to treat and is rarely life-threatening.",
