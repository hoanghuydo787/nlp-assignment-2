    "subsection_content": "During ventricular tachycardia, the heart often beats at a very fast frequency and the efficiency of each beat is very low compared to normal sinus rhythm, thus often not providing enough blood to other organs. Ventricular tachycardia may last only a few seconds. Sustained ventricular tachycardia is often a dangerous, life-threatening condition.
