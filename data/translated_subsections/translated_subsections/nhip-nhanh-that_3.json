    "subsection_content": "Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation are both serious types of arrhythmias, but ventricular fibrillation is more serious. With ventricular tachycardia, a fast heart rate and weaker than normal contractility reduce blood supply to other organs. Meanwhile, ventricular fibrillation will cause the heart to stop beating and cause sudden death.\nIn some diseases, prolonged ventricular tachycardia can also transform into ventricular fibrillation.\nReference: Is fast heart rate dangerous?",
