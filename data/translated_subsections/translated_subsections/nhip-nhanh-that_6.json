During an electrocardiogram, sensors (electrodes) are attached to the chest and arms and legs to measure the heart's electrical activity. An electrocardiogram measures the timing and duration of each electrical phase during a heartbeat. Doctors look for signal patterns to determine the type of tachycardia and how heart problems may be causing the tachycardia.\n2. Holter ECG\nThis is a continuous electrocardiogram monitor. Electrodes (small conductive pads) are taped to the person's chest and attached by wire to a small storage device. The electrodes must be securely attached to the chest for the machine to accurately record the heart's electrical activity. The patient carries the Holter monitor in a pocket or bag worn around the neck or waist.\nWhile wearing the monitor, it records your heart's electrical activity. After 24-48 hours, the doctor checks to see if there are any electrocardiographic abnormalities or arrhythmias. Patients also need to note the symptoms that appear during their monitoring period so that the doctor can see if they are consistent with the Holter monitoring results.\n3. Echocardiography\nThis is a method that helps doctors capture images of the heart structure, heart valves as well as the heart's sphincter function to suggest the cause of arrhythmia.\n4. Cardiac electrophysiological survey (EPS)\nCardiac electrophysiology (EPS) is a procedure that helps evaluate electrical activity in the heart and accurately diagnose the cause of arrhythmias. Doctors will insert electrodes from the femoral vein into the heart to evaluate the heart's electrical activity and trigger arrhythmias. In many cases, this procedure is often performed in conjunction with ablation of arrhythmia foci.",
