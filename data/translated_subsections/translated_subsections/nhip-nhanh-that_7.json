    "subsection_content": "Complications of ventricular tachycardia depend on how fast the heart beats, how long the arrhythmia lasts, etc. Ventricular tachycardia can cause serious complications, especially with prolonged attacks. Complications include: (4)\nHeart failure: If left untreated, ventricular tachyarrhythmias can lead to heart failure. In patients with heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias also make heart failure worse; Sudden cardiac death: Sustained ventricular tachycardia is associated with a risk of sudden death.",
