    "subsection_content": "Treatment will depend on the cause of the arrhythmia. In some arrhythmias, patients may be advised to avoid drinking alcohol, not exercising too much or using certain medications.\nOther treatments include:\nElectric shock: Doctors use an electric shock to return the heart's rhythm to normal. This is a common emergency treatment, especially if ventricular tachycardia causes the person to faint or have low blood pressure. Antiarrhythmic drugs; Implantable defibrillator (ICD): This is a small device that is usually placed under the skin of the chest. The ICD plays the role of a \"watchman\", helping to detect life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and creating electric shocks to save the patient's life and return the heart rhythm to normal..; Arrhythmia ablation: Also known as catheter ablation of arrhythmias. The doctor inserts electrodes into the heart to detect the location of the arrhythmia and uses heat energy to destroy the area of ​​heart muscle tissue causing the arrhythmia. Some types of ventricular tachycardia can be completely cured with this method.\nDoctors at Tam Anh General Hospital Heart Center treat ventricular tachycardia with ablation.",
