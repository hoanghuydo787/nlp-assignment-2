    "subsection_content": "Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction is a manifestation of acute coronary syndrome and is one of three problems that cause ischemia to the heart. Two other conditions are ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina (sudden chest pain due to anemia, often occurring while resting but not as dangerous as myocardial infarction).\nThe disease can occur due to direct or indirect causes. (2)\nDirect cause\nSome conditions can directly reduce blood supply to the heart, such as:\nAtherosclerotic plaque: Originated from cholesterol in the blood. Similar to a clogged pipe that slows drainage, plaque buildup can reduce blood flow to the heart muscle. Plaques in the arteries can also erode or rupture, rapidly (within minutes to hours) narrowing or blocking the artery.; Vasospasm: There is a layer of smooth muscle in the blood vessels that controls the degree of narrowing or widening of those vessels. Just like cramps or spasms in the leg/back muscles, the muscle layer of the coronary arteries can also go into spasm (called vasospasm). This can restrict or block blood flow and cause a heart attack.; Coronary embolism: This is a blood clot that travels from somewhere else and gets stuck in an artery of the heart, thereby partially or completely stopping blood flow to the heart muscle. These are extremely rare.; Although protected by the thoracic skeleton and other structures, the heart can still be damaged for a variety of reasons leading to increased cardiac enzymes and must be distinguished from non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. . Those causes include:; Myocarditis: May be caused by an infection (usually viral) affecting the heart muscle; Types of toxins: Some toxins can damage the heart muscle, causing heart attacks. One of the most common examples is caused by carbon monoxide poisoning.; Myocardial contusion injury: A mechanical injury that causes contusion, damage to the coronary arteries and leads to non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. These cases are rare and usually only occur with severe injuries such as car accidents.\nIndirect cause\nIndirect causes of blood supply interruption include:\nSevere hypertension (also called “malignant hypertension” or “hypertension emergency”) and hypotension (low blood pressure). The body naturally responds to low blood pressure by making the heart contract harder; High blood pressure occurs because blood vessels have greater resistance to blood flow. In both situations, the heart is always trying to pump harder and requires more blood to maintain that level of effort.; Tachycardia: When part or all of the heart contracts too quickly, the heart pumps blood less effectively. At the same time, the heart muscle may also need more oxygen than the blood can supply.; Aortic valve stenosis: This condition is a narrowing of the aortic valve – the last valve through which blood flows before leaving the heart. In people with severe aortic valve stenosis, the heart muscle has to work harder to compensate for the narrowing and may need more oxygen than blood can supply.; Pulmonary embolism: This is when a blood clot gets stuck in the lungs, preventing blood from passing through and getting oxygen before returning to the heart.\nWhen the heart is not supplied with enough blood as needed, this leads to a heart attack.",
