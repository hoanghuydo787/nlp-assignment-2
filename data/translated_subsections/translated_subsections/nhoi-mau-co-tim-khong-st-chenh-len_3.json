    "subsection_content": "Doctors diagnose non-ST elevation myocardial infarction based on a combination of information about the patient's medical condition and performing a few necessary tests, especially cardiac biomarker tests (troponin). . This is especially important because the disease has less specific symptoms or electrocardiograms than ST-elevation myocardial infarction. (3)\n1. Direct examination\nThe doctor will listen to the patient's heart and breathing, and check blood pressure. Then, if the person is medically stable and able to answer questions, the doctor will collect patient history information, including details about current lifestyle, living situation, and underlying medical conditions. .\n2. Electrocardiogram (ECG)\nAn electrocardiogram is one of the most important ways to diagnose heart attack in general and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in particular. This test detects the heart's electrical activity and displays it as a wave. A heart attack can cause changes in the electrocardiogram pattern, which doctors are trained to understand and use to make a diagnosis.\nWhile ST-elevation myocardial infarction results in consistently high ST-segment waves, this does not occur with non-ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction. Instead, the following changes may show up on the ECG during a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction:\nTransient ST elevation: This means the ST segment is higher, but it only stays that way for a short time.; ST depression: Under normal circumstances, the ST segment is usually equal to the baseline of the wave. However, with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, the ST segment may fall below baseline; New T wave inversion: The T wave is the final wave in the PQRST complex; The complex will then restart at point P of the next heartbeat. The new T wave inversion means that, if normally the T wave curves upward (like a hill), it now curves downward (like a bowl).\n3. Blood test for cardiac biomarkers\nWhen heart muscle cells are damaged or die for any reason, they release a chemical called a cardiac biomarker – troponin. This cardiac biomarker can be detected by blood tests and this makes blood testing one of the most reliable ways to diagnose any type of heart attack. However, it is sometimes necessary to repeat the troponin test because it can take time to reach detectable levels (usually less than 6 hours).\n4. Echocardiography\nThis test uses sound waves to create images of the inside and outside of the heart. Because echocardiography equipment can be moved on a mobile cart for use at the bedside, they are often used in emergency rooms.\n5. Coronary computed tomography (MSCT) angiography\nCoronary computed tomography angiography uses X-rays to take images, which a computer then reconstructs into a three-dimensional image of the complete coronary artery system. Contrast dye is used so that images of the heart show up clearly on the scan. This will allow your doctor to identify calcified plaques or narrowing in the coronary arteries.\n6. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nMRI uses a powerful magnet and computer processing software to create extremely detailed scans of the heart's components.",
