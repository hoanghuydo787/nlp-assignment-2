    "subsection_content": "Treatment of all heart attacks requires rapid restoration of blood flow to the heart muscle. Oxygen can be helpful if your blood oxygen levels are low, but this varies from person to person.\nA number of other treatments and techniques are possible, some sequentially or concurrently.\n1. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)\nPercutaneous coronary intervention is a procedure in which an interventional cardiologist inserts a catheter device into a major blood vessel (usually in the wrist or near the upper thigh). Then thread the device to the heart and damaged arteries. Next, the doctor inflates a balloon at the tip of the device, helping to clear the blockage and inserts the stent. A stent is a device that acts as a scaffold to help blood vessels open and not collapse.\nTeam of doctors at Tam Anh General Hospital intervened to insert coronary stents for patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.\n2. Using medicine\nCertain medications (which may be taken before confirming a diagnosis) may help people with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, including:\nAspirin or other antiplatelet drugs: These drugs prevent platelets from clumping together and forming clots in the blood. This is important because it prevents blockages caused by blood clots.; Anticoagulants: Like antiplatelet drugs, these drugs also interfere with blood clotting but by interfering with the clotting process itself, not the platelets.; Beta blockers: These drugs slow the heart rate and cause the heart to pump with less force. Both of these effects are important because they reduce the amount of oxygen the heart needs, by reducing how hard the heart works. Beta blockers may not be used if you have low blood pressure, heart failure or certain types of heart rhythm problems (arrhythmia). Nitroglycerin: Helps blood vessels widen, improving blood flow. This medicine is especially effective in treating chest pain caused by anemia.; Statins: These drugs reduce the amount of cholesterol in the blood and reduce the risk of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries so that the condition does not get worse.\n3. Coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG)\nIn cases where one or more heart arteries are significantly narrowed or blocked, surgery is a better option to restore blood flow. Coronary artery bypass surgery is also known as bypass surgery or open heart surgery.\nDuring CABG, the surgeon will take a blood vessel from elsewhere in the body (such as one of the legs or inside the chest wall). The doctor then uses that blood vessel to create a bypass around the heart's blocked artery. This allows blood flow to pass through the problem, clogged area.",
