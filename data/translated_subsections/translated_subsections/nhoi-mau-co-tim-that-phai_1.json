    "subsection_content": "MSc. Vo Anh Minh - Doctor at the Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, said that the main cause of right ventricular myocardial infarction is atherosclerotic plaque blocking the proximal part of the right coronary artery. (atherosclerosis). This condition leads to ischemia in the right heart, increasing the risk of death when there is an acute myocardial infarction.\nThe right ventricle (RV) receives its arterial blood supply primarily from the right coronary artery (RCA), which arises from the right coronary sinus of the aorta. The division creates the conic artery, which provides blood flow to the right ventricular outflow tract. The second branch from the RCA supplies the sinus node (SA). The RCA then gives off branches (AM) that supply blood to the right ventricle and the main branch goes to the atrioventricular groove and divides into the posterior interventricular artery (PDA) and posterolateral arterial branches. (2)\nThe distal right coronary artery supplies a branch that feeds the atrioventricular (AV) node in 90% of patients, with a branch of the circumflex supplying blood to the remaining patients. The PDA supplies the inferior wall of both ventricles and is a terminal branch of the RCA in 85% of patients but may originate from the left coronary artery in 15% of the population.\nThe main impact of RV ischemia and infarction is due to reduced RV contractility. This leads to reduced blood flow from the venous system to the lungs and ultimately the left heart. The clinical signs of this are increased right-sided cardiac pressure, increased pulmonary artery (PA) systolic pressure, and decreased left ventricular preload. Symptoms may include peripheral edema, especially varicose veins, hypoxemia, and hypotension.\nIn addition, when the right ventricle dilates, the movement and function of the interventricular septum are changed. Depending on the area of ​​infarction, symptoms may include marked hypotension and heart failure. If the septum shifts to the left during diastole, it impedes left ventricular filling and results in decreased cardiac output. This is called loss of interdependence between the two ventricles.",
