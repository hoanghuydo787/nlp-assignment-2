    "subsection_content": "Patients may experience some symptoms such as: (3)\nChest pain with or without spasms, shortness of breath, nausea and dizziness;; Arrhythmia ranging from bradycardia to complete heart block;; Hypotension;; Acute peripheral arterial edema and cone venous distension;; Right ventricular dysfunction with symptoms of varicose veins, clear lungs, and hypotension;; A systolic murmur heard over the left lower parasternal part may indicate tricuspid regurgitation. However this does not always appear;; The third and/or fourth heart sound produced by a right ventricular myocardial infarction is heard at the left lower sternal border. However, this symptom is rare.\nMore than 30% of patients with inferior myocardial infarction have right ventricular infarction. But only 10% of cases have significant hemodynamic effects due to right ventricular dysfunction.",
