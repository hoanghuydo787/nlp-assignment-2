    "subsection_content": "Impaired right heart function, if clinically significant, can lead to decreased left ventricular preload, decreased cardiac output, and ultimately systemic hypotension. Some treatments for right ventricular myocardial infarction include:\nInternally medical treatment\n1. Infusion\nUse an infusion of approximately 500 ml of solution to evaluate and monitor hemodynamic improvement or worsening hemodynamic changes.\n2. Nitrate medicine\nNitrate drugs are often used to treat myocardial infarction. However, this medication can cause side effects that make right ventricular dysfunction and systemic hypotension more severe. Therefore, the doctor will evaluate the patient's condition to see if treatment with this drug is recommended or not, and if so, careful monitoring is needed.\n3. Other drugs\nDobutamine: Use of inotropes can help improve myocardial contractility in cases of suboptimal reduction. The drug also helps improve cardiac index and cardiac output of the right ventricle.; Inhaled nitric oxide combined with dobutamine: The combination of inhaled nitric oxide with dobutamine additionally helps reduce pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), thereby reducing pressure on the right ventricle and myocardial activity. ; Milrinone: This is a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor that may improve right ventricular dysfunction. However, your doctor will consider the benefits and risks before using the drug because the drug can worsen systemic hypotension.; Levosimendan: The drug can help increase cardiac contractility by increasing the sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to intracellular calcium without increasing calcium concentration, thereby improving right ventricular function.\n4. Coronary intervention\nSimilar to the treatment of left ventricular myocardial infarction, the time to revascularize the right ventricular artery is the main factor determining the patient's survival and recovery. Percutaneous coronary intervention is the optimal choice to help revascularize clogged arteries and improve blood flow to the right heart.",
