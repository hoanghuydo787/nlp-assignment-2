    "subsection_content": "The short-term prognosis of patients with right ventricular myocardial infarction is worse than that of left ventricular myocardial infarction. Morbidity and mortality during hospitalization both increased. This is due to complications arising from right ventricular myocardial infarction, which may require additional procedures (ICD placement, VAD placement, arrhythmia intervention). The long-term prognosis of patients discharged from the hospital after treatment for right ventricular myocardial infarction is similar to that of patients with left ventricular myocardial infarction.\nPrognosis is based on several factors. Inferior myocardial infarction complicated by RVMI has a worse prognosis than other cases. If the patient does not have right ventricular (RV) failure, the mortality rate within 30 days of hospitalization is 4.4% with thrombolytic therapy and 3.2% with percutaneous intervention (PCI). This rate increased to 13% for thrombolysis and 8.3% for PCI in patients with RV failure. In patients with cardiogenic shock, mortality increases to 100% with thrombolysis and 44% with PCI.\nDaily exercise helps prevent the risk of cardiovascular disease\nThe diagnosis and treatment of right ventricular myocardial infarction is very complex, requiring the coordination of a team of cardiac surgeons, interventional vascular physicians, cardiologists, intensivists, and anesthesiologists. . Most patients with right ventricular myocardial infarction have risk factors for coronary artery disease. Patients need to control their weight, quit smoking, exercise regularly, take medication as prescribed, and control blood fat. Patients need to have follow-up appointments to closely monitor their health, detect abnormalities early and intervene promptly.",
