    "subsection_content": "Cerebral infarction is a medical condition that occurs when the cerebral arteries are narrowed, blocked or due to hypotension, leading to lack of blood supply to the brain. This causes part of the brain to have impaired function and dysfunction. If prolonged and not treated promptly, it can cause brain necrosis due to lack of oxygen and glucose.(2)\nThe longer the delay in emergency treatment for cerebral infarction, the higher the risk of necrosis. The part of the brain that is necrotic due to cerebral infarction is difficult, even impossible, to recover. Depending on the area of ​​the brain damaged, the patient may become disabled or die.\nAccording to statistics, cerebral infarction accounts for about 85% of stroke cases.",
