Can cerebral infarction be recovered?\nDepending on the severity of the disease and the duration of emergency treatment, patients with cerebral infarction have different chances of recovery. Specifically, for young patients, the disease is mild and only half of the body is paralyzed, often having a higher chance of recovery than patients with full body paralysis. For the elderly, patients with broken blood vessels in the brain... the recovery rate is very low.\nAlthough 100% recovery for patients with cerebral infarction is very difficult, if given proper care, follow the treatment regimen from the doctor, combine nutrition and physical therapy, Patients can recover 90% - 95%.\nIn addition, to increase survival rates and chances of future recovery, patients need to be treated promptly during the \"golden time\" with appropriate measures. Depending on the cause of the disease, the doctor will have appropriate treatment. Specifically, in cases of cerebral infarction due to hypertension, blood pressure control will be combined with active resuscitation; in cases of stroke due to vascular abnormalities, endovascular intervention or surgery will be performed.\n2. Is cerebral infarction dangerous?\nIt can be affirmed that cerebral infarction is an extremely dangerous disease. The disease has the potential to cause many serious complications such as hemiplegia, consciousness disorders, loss of speech, coma... even leading to death if not promptly intervened.\nTo schedule an appointment for examination and treatment of cerebral infarction, Tam Anh General Hospital, please contact:\n3.
