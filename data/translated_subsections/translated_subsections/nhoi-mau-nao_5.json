Motor paralysis\nPeople who experience cerebral infarction often encounter complications that limit movement such as hemiplegia, paralysis of legs and arms, etc., leading to incontinence in personal hygiene and daily activities, requiring assistance. help from family members.\nLying in one place for a long time also causes risks of urinary tract infections, skin ulcers and affects the respiratory tract. Therefore, family members need to pay special attention when taking care of patients with cerebral infarction. Regularly practice personal hygiene, practice gentle exercises... so that the patient can recover quickly.\n2. Language disorder\nNot only is movement limited, the language ability of people who have experienced a cerebral infarction is also greatly affected. This is a common sequela of cerebral infarction. Specifically, patients often have slurred speech, can only say very few words, or more seriously, cannot speak. The cause of this condition is that the brain area responsible for language function has been seriously damaged without timely intervention and treatment.\n3. Cognitive decline\nIn addition, people with cerebral infarction are also at risk of cognitive decline or even dementia. Many of these cases take a long time to recover. However, it is difficult for patients to fully return to work that requires mental clarity and high complexity as before.\n4. Blurry vision - common sequelae of cerebral infarction\nWhen a brain infarction occurs, many people have signs of blurred vision in one or both eyes. This is called post-stroke visual disturbances.\n5. Urinary disorders\nPatients with cerebral infarction may also experience incontinence in defecation and urination. If not cleaned cleanly and properly, it can lead to urinary tract infection.",
