Use aspirin and antiplatelet drugs\nAspirin and antiplatelet drugs are prescribed by doctors for almost all cases of ischemic stroke, except for patients who are allergic or intolerant to aspirin;(4)\nMeanwhile, Heparin and anticoagulants are only used when patients with cerebral infarction have atrial fibrillation or heart valve disease. In addition, the drug also has the function of preventing deep vein thrombosis.\n2. Antihypertensive drugs\nOne of the main causes of cerebral infarction is high blood pressure. Therefore, antihypertensive treatment is extremely necessary for hypertensive patients who have not yet had a stroke and patients who have had a cerebral infarction.\nOne of the main causes of cerebral infarction is high blood pressure, so treatment to lower blood pressure is extremely necessary.\n3. Treatment of diabetes in stroke\nAccording to recommendations from experts, patients with cerebral infarction and underlying diabetes should be treated in parallel to maintain normal blood sugar levels and HbA1c below 7%.\n4. Thrombolytic treatment\nThrombolytic therapy is a specific treatment method for cases requiring treatment of cerebral infarction. However, to apply this method, the patient needs to fully meet the testing and time criteria (no more than 4.5 hours from the onset of the disease).",
