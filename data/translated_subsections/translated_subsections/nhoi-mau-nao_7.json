At this time, family members need to pay special attention to how to care for the patient appropriately:\nClean personal hygiene: People with cerebral infarction have a high risk of paralysis and cannot control their bowels and urination, which can easily lead to urinary tract infections. The patient's personal hygiene depends almost entirely on the caregiver. Besides helping the patient with personal hygiene (brushing teeth, washing face, wiping the body, changing clothes...), after the patient has finished defecating and urinating, family members should dry it carefully to avoid infection.; Clean personal hygiene: People with cerebral infarction have a high risk of paralysis and cannot control their bowels and urination, which can easily lead to urinary tract infections.
