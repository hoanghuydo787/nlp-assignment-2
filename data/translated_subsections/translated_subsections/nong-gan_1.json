People with liver heat disease for a long time, if not detected promptly, may have severe symptoms. more like:\n1. Skin color changes, eye color changes\nJaundice is a severe symptom indicating biliary obstruction within or outside the liver. Bilirubin produced by the liver is normally stored in the gallbladder and then poured into the duodenum to digest food. If there is damage to the liver and/or biliary tract, bilirubin instead of being poured into the duodenum will stagnate and Absorbed into the blood causing yellow skin and eyes.(3)\n2. Stool and urine change color\nChanges in stool and urine color are a sign of severe liver disease. Damage to the liver parenchyma causes bile obstruction in the liver, leading to the absorption of more bilirubin into the blood, then excreting more than the normal amount of urobilin in the urine, making the urine dark yellow.\nNormally, in the intestine, bacteria convert bilirubin into urobilinogen, then most of it is converted into stercobilin, making the stool yellow. When the biliary obstruction is complete, the amount of stercobilin in the stool is very small, so the patient's stool is light gray or pale. silver color\n3. Red, itchy, uncomfortable rash\nRash and itching are another easily recognizable manifestation of liver dysfunction; This situation is also quite easy to see. The skin of patients with liver dysfunction often appears red with many nodules and thickening. The rash can cause discomfort and itching. In addition to the main cause of bile obstruction causing itching, the inability to completely eliminate toxins due to liver weakness also plays an important role.\n4. Ascites (ascites)\nAscites (ascites) is a sign of decompensated cirrhosis, a serious complication of chronic liver disease, increasing mortality as well as affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of complications. others such as intra-abdominal fluid infection, bloody vomiting, liver cancer\n5. Other signs: loss of appetite, nausea,...\nHaving liver problems means that the body will experience unusual health symptoms - the most common are loss of appetite, nausea, bleeding gums, difficulty sleeping/insomnia, physical weakness, etc.",
