    "subsection_content": "Liver heat (Liver dysfunction) originates from many different causes; It can be from eating habits, living habits, medication use or liver diseases.\n1. Having viral hepatitis\nThere are many types of viral hepatitis that cause chronic liver disease, of which viral hepatitis B and C are the most common. Viral hepatitis often progresses silently, causing damage to the liver parenchyma, causing the liver to gradually decline in function. Depending on each case, the disease may or may not have symptoms; Most are only recognized when the disease enters a severe stage. Common warning signs of the disease can be fever, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, etc. (2)\n2. Have fatty liver\nWhen the amount of fat accumulated in the liver is 5% or more, negatively affecting the liver's function, this is a fatty liver condition. Fatty liver has many levels of disease: fatty liver level 1-2-3, if not controlled and treated promptly, will cause many damages such as fatty liver disease, steatohepatitis and can eventually lead to fatty liver disease. to cirrhosis and fatty liver cancer\nFatty liver is one of the causes of liver heat\n3. Autoimmune liver disease\nWhen the immune system is “confused” – instead of attacking pathogens, it targets liver cells – this is called an autoimmune liver condition. Although this is not a common disease, it still needs attention and early treatment to avoid further damage to the liver.\nIn the early stages, it is not easy to detect the disease because symptoms are often vague. Later, the patient gradually feels the disease more clearly through conditions such as body fatigue, jaundice, yellow eyes, etc.\n4. Drink a lot of alcoholic drinks\nBeer, alcohol and alcoholic beverages are the liver's top \"enemies\". Not only does it make the liver hot, but it is also a common cause of other liver diseases such as fatty liver, cirrhosis, liver failure, liver cancer, etc.\nWhen entering the body, only about 10% of alcohol is eliminated through breath, sweat, urine, etc. The remaining amount will \"penetrate\" into the body; Especially in the digestive system, it triggers inflammatory reactions, oxidative stress, etc. For the liver, alcohol damages cells and causes the liver to gradually lose its ability to filter waste. Not only liver heat, but a series of other liver diseases caused by alcohol have a high risk of overlapping, such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, fatty liver, liver failure, etc.\n5. Abusing drugs to treat diseases\nThere are Western drugs that when used for a long time without a doctor's prescription will significantly affect the liver. Drug abuse causes the liver to overwork to eliminate some \"toxic\" components of the drug, including causing symptoms of hot liver disease.\n6. Eating unscientifically\nDiet also plays a significant role in affecting liver health. Consuming too much fried, greasy or hot foods; Plus eating less green vegetables, fruits, foods rich in fiber, etc. will put a lot of pressure on the liver's ability to function. Liver heat is a sign that the liver is sending a warning signal that you need to review and improve your diet.",
