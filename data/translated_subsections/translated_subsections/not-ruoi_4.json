Moles will normally have a clear, regular edge; Congenital moles: These are moles discovered at birth, also known as birthmarks. 1 in 100 people have congenital moles. This type of mole has a greater risk of developing into melanoma than moles that appear after birth. If the mole diameter is larger than 8mm, the risk of cancer increases; Dysplastic moles: Also known as atypical moles. This type of mole is usually larger than 5mm with blurred/pale borders, irregular shape and uneven color and is often hereditary. The more dysplastic moles a person has, the greater the risk of melanoma and skin cancer.\nAmong the types of moles, dysplastic moles are the type that are at risk of forming melanoma",
