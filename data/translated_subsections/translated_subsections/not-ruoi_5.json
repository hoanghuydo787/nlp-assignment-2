    "subsection_content": "Benign and malignant moles have different characteristics; There are a number of identifying signs that can be easily observed with the naked eye.\n1. Benign moles\nThe most familiar sign of a benign mole is a small brown spot. There are also other features such as:\nColor and texture: Can be brown, black, blue, red or pink. uniform color. Smooth, flat or slightly raised surface; Shape: Most are round or oval, with clear edges; Size: Usually less than 6mm in diameter. Congenital moles can be larger than normal, covering part of the face, body or limbs\n2. Malignant moles\nMoles can be a sign of skin cancer with abnormalities in shape (unclear borders), irregular color, rapid enlargement or rapid elevation causing ulceration. Some special locations can also cause moles to become cancerous such as: areas exposed to light (face, neck, chest...) or areas that are rubbed a lot such as the scalp (due to brushing), clothes folds...\nThe common location of the tumor in men is on the chest and back (due to being naked); In women, it is the neck (because the shirt has no collar). In particular, malignant Melanoma is one of the most common types of cancer in young women.\nSome notes below will help you grasp the warning signs of malignant moles. If you find that you are experiencing one or more of the symptoms, you should have a dermatological examination as soon as possible.\nTime of appearance: Moles first appear after age 25; Asymmetrical shape, the two halves of the mole are not the same/don't match each other; Has irregular borders; the edges are notched or jagged like a scalloped shape; The color of the mole changes or has many colors or uneven colors; The diameter of the mole is large, about 6mm or more; Noticing changes in mole size, color, shape, and elevation; Moles have additional symptoms such as itching, burning pain, bleeding, oozing, peeling, scabbing or suddenly softening; Moles with hair lose all their hair\nIn addition, it is necessary to distinguish moles that are not brown spots around the eyes, cheeks or nose (often called flesh moles). These brown spots are actually dermatophytosis - a type of seborrheic keratosis and do not originate from clusters of pigment-forming cells like moles. “Flesh moles” have no risk of developing into skin cancer and can be treated if you feel they are affected aesthetically.\nMoles are also easily confused with freckles. Freckles are also small brown spots that often appear on the face, neck, chest and arms but do not pose a threat to health. Freckles are often easily seen in hot summers in people with fair skin.\nBenign moles are usually uniform in color, have clear borders, and are symmetrical on both sides",
