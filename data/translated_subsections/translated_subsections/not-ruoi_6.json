Melanoma is the biggest potential risk of moles.\nIn fact, moles themselves are not a sign of skin cancer, but dysplastic mole cells can mutate into melanocytes under certain conditions.\nPeople with many moles (10 or more), especially if they are dysplastic moles, the risk of developing skin-related diseases - specifically skin cancer - also increases many times. The probability of the disease will also increase if other skin cancer risk factors are combined such as having a family history of skin cancer, frequent long exposure to the sun or people with fair skin, etc.\nIn addition, if the mole is located in a vulnerable location such as being susceptible to collisions or scratches, you need to pay attention to avoid letting the mole bleed to limit the risk of infection. Infected moles can cause pain, bleeding, discharge or fever.",
