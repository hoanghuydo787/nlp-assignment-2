    "subsection_content": "Your doctor can diagnose moles by direct observation/dermatoscopy. During a dermatological examination, your entire body will be examined.\nAccording to the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the 7-point checklist for assessing moles includes the following:\nDoes the mole cause pain, itching or any strange sensation?; Are moles evenly colored?; Does the mole have an unusual shape? Does the size of the mole change?; Is the mole diameter larger than 7mm?; Does the mole bleed?; Is the mole red, swollen, or inflamed?\nIf the mole has only mild changes, you will need to monitor it for a few weeks after having a clinical photo taken and the mole size measured. If a mole is suspected to be at high risk of cancer, the doctor will perform a biopsy immediately. If the test results are suspicious of melanoma, you will need to have additional tests to determine whether the cancer has metastasized.\nWe should self-examine our whole body skin at least every 3-4 months. If you discover any new or changing moles, you should get it checked out early.\nSkin examination is a method that helps doctors check more specifically about the type of mole you have",
