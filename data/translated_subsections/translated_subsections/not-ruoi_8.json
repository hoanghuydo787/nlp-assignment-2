For moles that are suspected of being bad or you want to remove them more completely, you can consider mole removal.\nMole removal is usually performed in a short time and can be treated on an outpatient basis. The doctor will locally anesthetize the area around the mole, then use professional medical tools to \"remove\" the mole. Mole removal can leave small scars. For people with sensitive skin, there is also the possibility of keloid scars or changes in skin pigmentation at the cut.; Removal techniques will depend on the size of the mole, the degree of growth of the mole to the surface of the skin or spread to other parts of the body. If the cancer has spread to the blood or lymphatic system and formed tumors in other areas, the patient will need other more intensive treatments. After mole removal, you need to pay attention to keeping the wound clean and use painkillers if necessary and should see a doctor soon if the wound is red, swollen, painful, exuding fluid or has a bad smell.; If after removing the mole it still reappears, you need to see a specialist soon because this is also a sign that it may be malignant.\nNote: Never remove moles yourself at home. Shaving or removing moles yourself has a high risk of harm, not only increasing the possibility of scarring but also making the skin susceptible to infection. More dangerous for malignant moles can also spread to surrounding skin.",
