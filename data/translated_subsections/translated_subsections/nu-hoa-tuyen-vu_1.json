    "subsection_content": "According to experts, hormonal imbalance is the main cause of gynecomastia in men. Hormonal imbalance in men can be due to the following reasons:\n1. Natural hormonal changes\nIn the male body there is both the male sex hormone testosterone and the female sex hormone estrogen. Testosterone controls male characteristics such as muscle mass and body hair. Meanwhile, estrogen controls the development of mammary glands. When estrogen levels in the male body are too high or imbalanced with testosterone levels, it can cause gynecomastia. This condition usually occurs in the following 3 stages:\nNewborn: More than 50% of male newborns have gynecomastia due to the influence of estrogen from the mother. However, this condition will disappear within 2-3 weeks after giving birth.; Puberty: This is a fairly common condition, due to hormonal imbalance during puberty. However, in most cases, the condition will disappear after six months to two years without treatment.; Adulthood: About 24 - 65% of men aged 50 - 80 years old have gynecomastia.\nNatural hormonal changes can cause gynecomastia in older men\n2. Medicine\nSome medications can cause gynecomastia such as:\nAnti-androgen drugs: Treat prostate enlargement, prostate cancer and some other conditions such as flutamide, finasteride (Proscar, Propecia) and spironolactone (Aldactone, Carospir).; Anabolic and androgenic steroids: Treatment of hormonal deficiencies, delayed puberty or muscle loss due to other diseases.; AIDS medications: The estrogen-like properties of some HIV medications can cause gynecomastia such as Efavirenz (Sustiva).; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications containing amphetamine such as Adderall.; Cardiovascular medications: such as digoxin (Lanoxin) and calcium channel blockers\nStomach emptying medications: such as metoclopramide (Reglan)\nStomach ulcer medications: such as cimetidine (Tagamet HB); Anti-anxiety medications: such as diazepam (Valium); Tricyclic antidepressants; Antibiotics; Cancer medicine\n3. Use of alcohol and drugs\nAlcohol abuse; Using anabolic steroids to increase muscle mass and improve athletic performance and some narcotics such as amphetamine, marijuana, heroin, and methadone have been determined to cause gynecomastia in men.\n4. Pathology\nSome diseases can cause gynecomastia in men due to affecting hormonal balance such as:\nHypogonadism: Klinefelter syndrome or hypopituitarism can reduce testosterone production in men, thereby causing gynecomastia; Aging: Hormonal changes that occur with aging can cause gynecomastia, especially in overweight men.; Tumors: Tumors involving the testicles, adrenal glands or pituitary gland can produce hormones that change the male-female hormone balance.; Hyperthyroidism: The thyroid gland produces too much of the hormone thyroxine.; Kidney failure: About half of people treated with dialysis develop gynecomastia due to hormonal changes.; Liver failure and cirrhosis: Changes in hormone levels related to liver problems and medications to treat cirrhosis have been linked to gynecomastia.; Malnutrition: When the body is not provided with adequate nutrients, testosterone levels will decrease while estrogen levels remain the same, thereby causing hormonal imbalance. However, gynecomastia can also occur when normal nutrition returns.; Herbal: Some vegetable oils such as tea or lavender, used in shampoos, soaps, and lotions are believed to be linked to gynecomastia due to their weak estrogenic activity. go out.",
