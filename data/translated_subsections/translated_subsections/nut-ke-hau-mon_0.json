    "subsection_content": "An anal fissure is a condition in which a tear appears in the mucosa layer, exposing the surrounding muscles, leading to spasms, which in the long run stretch the edges of the crack wider. Lesions often appear when the patient is constipated, defecating with hard, large stools, causing pain and bleeding.\nAnal fissures can occur at any age, most commonly in young children. Most tears tend to get better with simple treatments. However, some severe cases may require medication or even surgery. Depending on the level of pain and duration, the disease is divided into two groups as follows:\nAcute anal fissure: The fissure is shallow, small in size, signs of mild inflammation, and symptoms do not last more than 6 weeks. When suffering from acute anal fissures, the patient feels pain and burning, affecting daily activities. If the disease at this stage is not treated completely, it will easily become chronic.; Acute anal fissure: The fissure is shallow, small in size, signs of mild inflammation, and symptoms do not last more than 6 weeks.
