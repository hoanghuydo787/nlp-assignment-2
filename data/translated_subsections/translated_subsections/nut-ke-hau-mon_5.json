Among them, two main methods that are commonly implemented include:\n1. Use medication to treat anal fissures\nMedications to treat anal fissures often include stool softeners, fissure-healing medications, and sphincter-reducing medications. Some types commonly prescribed by doctors are as follows:\nNitroglycerin (Rectiv): This is a topical medication that increases blood flow to the fissure to relax the anal sphincter and speed up the healing process. Nitroglycerin is often the preferred choice after other conservative methods have failed. Common side effects are mainly headaches, or some more serious symptoms.; Nitroglycerin (Rectiv): This is a topical medication that increases blood flow to the fissure to relax the anal sphincter and speed up the healing process.
