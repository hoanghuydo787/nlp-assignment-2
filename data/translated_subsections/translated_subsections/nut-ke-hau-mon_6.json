Some useful solutions that can be implemented include:\n1. Add fiber\nWhen constipated, defecation will be difficult due to dry, hard, large stools, thereby causing anal fissures. Therefore, supplementing adequate fiber in the daily diet (20 - 35g/day) is really necessary. Some food sources rich in this ingredient include:\nWheat, whole oats; Whole grains: brown rice, corn...; Peas.; Seeds and nuts.; Citrus fruit.\n2. Drink enough water\nDrinking enough water every day is also a way to prevent constipation and minimize the formation of anal fissures. In particular, more water needs to be replenished after physical activity or in warm weather. However, not all drinks are good. For example, drinking a lot of alcohol and caffeine will increase the possibility of dehydration, which is not good for health.\n3. Exercise\nThe habit of exercising for at least 30 minutes a day will help keep the digestive system healthy. From there, the body will limit common constipation and diarrhea, effectively preventing the formation of anal fissures.\n4. Develop healthy bowel habits\nDo not hold in defecation or wait too long.; Don't sit on the toilet for too long.; Keep the anal area always dry, gently wipe clean after each bowel movement.; Use toilet paper containing natural ingredients or soft towels without fragrance or toxic chemicals.; Treat diseases that risk leading to anal fissures such as diarrhea, constipation... as soon as symptoms appear.\n5. Change diapers regularly (for newborns)\nAnal fissures are very common in newborns. Therefore, to prevent this condition, cleaning the baby's anus and changing diapers regularly is very important.\n6. Use laxatives\nIf conventional care methods such as adding water, fiber, etc. are not effective in treating constipation, the patient should use laxatives as prescribed by the doctor. Some important effects include:\nIncreases the amount of water in the intestines.; Lubricates stools to facilitate easier elimination from the body.; Water retention in the colon.; Stimulates the muscles in the intestines to speed up bowel movements.",
