    "subsection_content": "Doctor Le Thanh Hung said that depending on the health of the pregnancy and the time of amniotic rupture compared to when the fetus is full-term (37 weeks), it can cause different dangerous complications, of which the greatest risk is infection and premature birth.\nInfection\nThe amniotic sac has the role of protecting the fetus from the invasion and attack of harmful bacteria and germs. When the amniotic membrane ruptures, amniotic fluid leaks out, weakening this protective layer, allowing harmful microorganisms from outside to enter and damage the fetus. When infected, the fetus is at risk of respiratory failure at birth.\nIn the case of amniotic infection when the fetal position is not stable, it will lead to umbilical cord prolapse, even causing the umbilical cord to fall out, causing the fetus to not receive nutrition and oxygen.\nPregnant women with ruptured membranes are at risk of blood infection, peritonitis (membrane covering all organs inside the abdomen and pelvis)...\nPremature birth\nIn cases where the mother's water breaks with the risk of infection and complications, the obstetrician may request an immediate cesarean section if vaginal birth conditions are not favorable, prolonging the rupture time. Amniotic fluid infection will get worse.\nThe fetus being taken outside before the 37th week of pregnancy can cause many serious effects on the child's health in the future such as respiratory diseases, visual diseases, infections...\nFetuses born before the 24th week of pregnancy have many health risks and premature birth diseases. In cases where the mother's membranes rupture prematurely, causing premature labor, the premature baby also faces similar risks.",
