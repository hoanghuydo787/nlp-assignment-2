    "subsection_content": "Doctor Le Thanh Hung said that depending on the age of the fetus when the mother's water breaks, the obstetrician will have appropriate intervention and treatment. For full-term fetuses, the pregnancy will be terminated immediately by normal birth or cesarean section. In the case of rupture of membranes when the fetus is still young (premature rupture of membranes), the fetus needs to be cared for and nourished.\nDepending on the gestational age when the membranes rupture prematurely, the doctor will prescribe appropriate continued feeding or termination of pregnancy\nDetail:\nGestational age 22 – 31 weeks\nAt this gestational age, the fetus is not fully developed. If it is born early, it can face many risks that threaten its health as well as the foundation for future physical development. Therefore, in case the membranes break, the doctor will try to continue to support the fetus by: Using lung maturation drugs (usually 24-34 weeks). Infection management such as limiting manual examination and using a speculum instead; culture of cervical, vaginal, and anal fluids for pregnant women; Use broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent infection for both mother and fetus; Monitor obstetric monitor 1-3 times/day, ultrasound evaluate fetus, placenta and amniotic fluid. Use antispasmodic drugs when women have labor contractions.\nGestational age 32 - 33 weeks\nThe doctor will prescribe continued care and nourishment of the fetus for the longest possible time by: Using corticosteroids to stimulate fetal lung maturity. Monitor the fetal heart rate and check the development of the fetus inside the uterus. Strictly and effectively control infections in pregnant women. Use tocolytics.\nWhen there is adequate evidence of lung maturity, infection, and fetal distress, the doctor will prescribe labor induction.\nGestational age 34 – 36 weeks\nThe doctor will continue to monitor the fetus through fetal ultrasound and obstetric monitor, and does not recommend the use of corticosteroids. About 90% of women will have spontaneous labor within 24 hours after their water breaks.\nDepending on the health of the fetus, amniotic state and infection, the doctor will prescribe waiting for natural labor or induction of labor or cesarean section. In cases where there is adequate lung maturity, the doctor will prescribe the fetus to be taken out and the pregnancy to be terminated immediately. In case the pregnancy remains, it is necessary to strictly manage the infection. Do not use tocolytic drugs at 36 weeks of pregnancy.\nGestational age over 37 weeks\nThe American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends terminating pregnancy when the membranes of the fetus over 37 weeks break, from 12 to 24 hours after the membrane breaks to minimize dangerous complications for the mother and fetus. Initiate labor immediately after 12 hours or earlier if convenient.",
