    "subsection_content": "Research by Danish and South African scientists shows that the hospitalization rate due to the stealth Omicron variant is no higher than that of the original Omicron variant. Most cases have mild symptoms, some people feel like they have the flu. If people get enough doses of Covid-19 vaccine, they will have a low risk of severe progression.\nThe stealthy Omircon strain causes symptoms of mild fever, cough, and body aches.\nResearchers at Denmark's Serum Institute say people who have been infected with the \"original\" Delta or Omicron variants can be reinfected with the secondary variant. Researching 140,000 genomes from November 2021 to mid-February 2022, scientists found 263 cases of reinfection, including 190 cases of stealth Omicron infection, of which 140 cases were after Delta infection and 47 infection after original Omicron infection. The cases of reinfection were all mild, with no cases becoming severe enough to require hospitalization or death.",
