    "subsection_content": "Initial studies show that stealth Omicron is up to 30% more infectious than the original Omicron variant (strains BA.1 and BA.1.1). A study by Japanese scientists concluded that invisible Omicron can cause more serious disease risks than the original Omicron. However, records in Denmark show that the hospitalization rate due to the BA.2 variant is equivalent to the original Omicron, milder than the Delta variant. The Public Health Agency of Africa also determined that BA.2 does not cause more severe disease than BA.1.\nAccording to WHO, BA.2 differs from BA.1 in its gene sequence, including amino acid differences in the mutant protein and other proteins. Specifically, BA.2 has a growth advantage and is easier to transmit than BA.1. However, this difference is not too much compared to the difference between BA.1 and Delta strain.",
