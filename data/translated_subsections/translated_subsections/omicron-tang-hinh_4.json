    "subsection_content": "Stealth Omicron spreads quickly, the symptoms are mostly mild like the flu but there are still differences so you can suspect early such as: burning pain and dry thirst in the throat, fatigue, body aches , sneezing, mild fever, etc. Based on suspected symptoms, you continue to use PCR testing, rapid testing to diagnose and protect your health.\nPCR method\nLike other Covid-19 variants, rapid tests and PCR tests are two typical methods to determine whether or not you are positive for the Omicron strain.\nPCR test is a test performed using Real-time technique. Medical staff will use a stick to take nasopharyngeal fluid from the body of a person suspected of being infected, then put it into the testing system to analyze and find the gene segment of the corona virus, thereby determining whether the test sample is positive or negative. calculated with Covid-19. Currently, Tam Anh General Hospital uses the most modern Alinity M testing system from the US to accurately diagnose the disease-causing virus using PCR technique and give results in less than 6 hours.\nPCR testing to determine Covid-19 has a high price and is used at medical facilities equipped with testing machines. This method takes a lot of time for the machine to analyze and produce accurate results.\nWhy can't the quick test detect the \"invisible\" Omicron?\nWhile PCR has a higher cost and is performed in medical facilities, rapid tests are widely used for everyone, anyone can check for themselves to determine whether they are infected or not. Although the level of accuracy is not as high as the PCR method, this is a popular way to help thousands of people know whether or not they are infected with Covid-19 in a short time and have appropriate treatment.\nIt is difficult to detect the invisible Omicron strain with a quick test kit.\nHowever, with the invisible Omicron variant, many people report that they cannot test positive even though they have all the symptoms of the disease such as: mild fever, sneezing, cough, muscle aches, etc. Medical experts say that in case you have all the symptoms of Omicron infection but still get a negative rapid test result due to many reasons.\nFirst, maybe you tested in the early days of exposure to the Omicron variant, so the results were still negative.\nSecond, during the process of performing a quick test, you did something wrong, leading to erroneous results. After a quick test, test results should be read after 15 to 30 minutes (depending on the manufacturer's instructions) to ensure accuracy.\nThird, the market has many types of test kits with uneven levels of sensitivity and specificity. Fake and poor quality kits can give unreliable results. Even some old test kits are no longer suitable for this variant, so they do not give correct results.",
