    "subsection_content": "The main way to prevent Covid-19 is to get enough vaccine doses and do 5K as recommended by the Ministry of Health. Below are 3 very important Covid-19 prevention measures.\nFace mask\nLike other variants, preventing the invisible Omicron variant by wearing masks properly is an easy to implement measure that brings certain effectiveness. Masks help prevent droplets and limit the infection process during daily contact and communication. At the same time, wearing a mask regularly also helps protect you from common flu viruses, avoiding diseases: colds, runny nose, cough, sore throat,...\nTaking good preventive measures will help protect you from post-Covid-19 lung damage.\nVaccine\nVaccines are the leading measure to prevent the stealth Omicron variant as well as other variants of Covid-19. Vaccinating with a full dose of Covid-19 vaccine will help the body produce antibodies against the attack of coronavirus, reducing the risk of hospitalization.\nReality shows that cases of Covid-19 that receive the full dose of vaccine often have mild symptoms, less severe progression, and recover quickly. Even for the invisible Omicron variant, if vaccinated, people infected with Covid-19 will only feel like they have a mild cold and can still live and work normally.\nEvusheld injection – monoclonal antibody for Covid-19 prevention\nTam Anh General Hospital System pioneered in bringing AstraZeneca's Evusheld - the world's first licensed Covid-19 preventive monoclonal antibody to Vietnam, promptly protecting vulnerable groups against Covid-19.\nFor the first time, high-risk groups of people such as: people with moderate to severe immunodeficiency, people who cannot be vaccinated or cannot produce enough antibodies to prevent Covid-19 even though they have been vaccinated... have a chance. Use prophylactic monoclonal antibodies for Covid-19, to quickly provide protection, reduce hospitalization and death.\nCurrently, AstraZeneca's first monoclonal antibody Evusheld for Covid-19 prevention has been licensed in the world. Tam Anh General Hospital system pioneered bringing Evusheld monoclonal antibodies to Vietnam, helping groups of people who cannot be vaccinated have the opportunity to prevent and reduce the risk of hospitalization, especially with variants of Covid 19 such as Delta, Omicron and Omicron stealth.",
