    "subsection_content": "For rashes on the chest, the examination and diagnosis process will be carried out sequentially from clinical to paraclinical examination, specifically as follows:\n1. Physical examination\nFirst, the doctor will diagnose the disease based on observing the morphology of the outer skin layer, including: shape, density, color, size, pain and distribution of the rash on the breast skin. Along with that, the doctor will discuss with the patient to collect some information about medical history, time of rash appearance, allergies, medications being used...\n2. Blood test\nThe doctor will conduct blood tests to find allergens that cause allergies as well as identify infectious factors, thereby eliminating the cause of breast skin rashes.\n3. Skin biopsy\nThis is a commonly used procedure in diagnosing dermatological diseases. The doctor will take a small sample of skin tissue from the rash area to perform a biopsy under a microscope.\n3. Breast ultrasound\nIn case a rash on the chest is detected as having a lump, the doctor will order an ultrasound to evaluate the condition of the breast lump. Ultrasound results will help doctors conclude whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign to have an appropriate treatment plan.\nDiagnosing a breast rash may require additional tests. Women should go to reputable medical facilities to receive the correct diagnosis, ensuring the most accurate results.",
