    "subsection_content": "Pneumococcal bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae often causes many different pneumococcal infections, most commonly otitis media, sinusitis, severe and life-threatening infections such as lung infections causing pneumonia, blood infection, meningitis...\n1. Pneumonia\nOne of the main causes of pneumonia in children and people over 65 years old and people with weak immune systems is pneumococcal infection. Pneumonia is an infection in the lungs that causes damage to the air sacs on one or both sides of the lungs, causing inflammation. The disease progresses quickly and can lead to complications if not accurately diagnosed and treated promptly.\nSymptoms of pneumonia are usually high fever, chills, in some cases hypothermia, chest pain, difficulty breathing, cough with phlegm or blood...\n2. Otitis media\nThis is an ear infection. The common cause is due to an infection in the upper respiratory tract that is not treated completely or improperly, leading to otitis media. The disease is common in young children with a rate of up to 80%.\nSymptoms of the disease are usually high fever, fussiness, loss of appetite, loss of appetite, ear rubbing, diarrhea...\nFor adults, the disease can also appear with more obvious and recognizable symptoms such as ear pain, fever, hearing problems, irritability, fatigue, and nausea. If severe, there may be fluid flowing from the ear out.\n3. Meningitis\nMeningitis caused by infected pneumococcus is very difficult to detect. The disease leaves many serious sequelae for sufferers.\nWhen infected, symptoms are often headaches and vomiting. This symptom can easily be confused with gastrointestinal diseases. In addition, the disease also shows signs of high fever and headache that last for many hours, even days. People infected with meningitis are very sensitive to light, have stiff neck, loss of appetite, disturbance of consciousness, drowsiness and restlessness. Meningitis caused by pneumococcal infection, if not detected and treated properly, can leave neurological sequelae.\n4. Sepsis in HIV infected people\nPeople with weakened immune systems (for example, people infected with HIV) are more susceptible to many diseases than normal people, including sepsis caused by pneumococcus.\nPneumococcal bacteria enter the bloodstream and cause many symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, drowsiness, and possibly fatal septic shock.\nIn addition to the above diseases, pneumococcus also causes many other diseases such as conjunctivitis, osteomyelitis, cellulitis, acute sinusitis, pericarditis...\nResident MSc Dang Thanh Do advises patients on diseases caused by pneumococcal bacteria.
