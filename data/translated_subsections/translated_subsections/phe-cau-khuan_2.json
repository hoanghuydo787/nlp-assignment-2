(3)\nMeningitis caused by pneumococcus is a worrying disease in children with 83% of cases occurring in children under 2 years old. The disease has a high mortality rate and leaves many serious sequelae, especially in developed countries in Asia and Africa. The risk of death in these countries is often over 50% of the total number of infected children. About 30 - 50% of the remaining people can survive but suffer sequelae such as disability, blindness, deafness, epilepsy, paralysis, developmental delay, memory loss, prolonged headaches...\nBesides meningitis, children also often suffer from otitis media caused by pneumococcal bacteria. According to statistics, up to 80% of children under 3 years old have at least one case of otitis media, especially children under 1 year old. More than 1/3 of them have repeated infections over a long period of time. The disease is easily transmitted from one child to another.\nSepsis (pneumococcal infection in the blood) is quite dangerous in cases with other underlying diseases, with a mortality rate of about 20%.\nPneumonia is the most common serious infection caused by pneumococcus; It manifests as bronchopneumonia or lobar pneumonia. Pneumococcus is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in all ages.",
