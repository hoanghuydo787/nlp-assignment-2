Certain environments such as military barracks or day care centers will find higher numbers of pneumococcus. Pneumococci attach to nasopharyngeal cells through bacterial surface adhesion. Localization can become infectious when microorganisms are introduced into areas such as the Eustachian tube or nasal sinuses, causing otitis media or sinusitis. Pneumonia occurs if pneumococcus is inhaled into the lungs and is not eliminated.\nPneumococcus can also spread through the bloodstream causing septicemia, leading to meningitis, brain abscess, septic arthritis or osteomyelitis.\nPeople with congenital hemiplegia, spleen removal surgery, sickle cell disease... leading to infection, people with compromised immune systems... will be at higher risk of pneumococcal disease.\nPneumococcus causes many diseases in children and adults.\nMethods of diagnosing pneumococcal infection\nDepending on the severity of symptoms and the impact on parts of the body, the doctor may prescribe paraclinical examinations such as:\nComputed tomography or chest X-ray;; Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test;; Test sputum, blood, fluid taken from the lungs, joints, bones, around the heart or abscesses.",
