As men age, blood testosterone levels begin to decrease, but the hormone dihydrotestosterone still accumulates in the prostate. This can promote the cells of this gland to continue growing. Many studies have confirmed that men who are unable to produce dihydrotestosterone will not have prostate enlargement.
