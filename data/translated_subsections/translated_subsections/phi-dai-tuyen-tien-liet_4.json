    "subsection_content": "Not all cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia require intervention. In some mild cases, patients do not need medical treatment or surgery. The doctor will base on the International prostate symptom score (IPSS) and the quality of life scale to provide appropriate treatment.\nSome recommended treatments for prostate enlargement are as follows:\n1. Natural method\nNatural treatment means not using drugs or surgical intervention, but making lifestyle changes, exercise, and rest to help reduce symptoms of the disease, including:\nUrinate as soon as you feel the urge; Frequent urination, even when there is no urge to urinate; Avoid taking over-the-counter respiratory medications or antihistamines because they can inhibit your bladder, making it difficult to empty your bladder; Avoid alcohol and caffeinated drinks, especially after dinner; Regulate mood, reduce stress, because stress can increase the number of urination; Regular exercise helps reduce the severity of the disease; Learn and practice Kegel exercises to strengthen the pelvic muscles; Keep your body warm, as cold can make symptoms worse\n2. Treatment with medication\nIn case natural remedies are not effective, the doctor will prescribe the patient medication to treat prostate enlargement including: (5)\nAlpha-1 blockers: This is a group of drugs that relax bladder and prostate muscles to help urine flow more easily such as: Doxazosin, Prazosin, Alfuzosin, Terazosin... The effectiveness of these drugs can be seen within a few minutes. days or weeks. Unwanted side effects can cause patients to have low blood pressure, fatigue, physical weakness and dizziness.; Hormone-reducing drugs (5 alpha-reductase inhibitors): Drugs that reduce levels of the hormone dihydrotestosterone produced by the prostate such as Dutasteride and Finasteride are often prescribed in this case. Medications can make the prostate smaller (especially if the prostate is > 30 mL) and improve urine flow. However, the drug can also lead to unwanted side effects such as erectile dysfunction and decreased sexual desire. Therefore, doctors often combine these drugs with alpha-1 blockers to achieve greater treatment effectiveness and reduce side effects.; Antimuscarinic drugs: Antimuscarinic drugs such as Oxybutynin ER, Solifenacin have the effect of relaxing smooth muscles, treating overactive bladder causing urgency and incontinence. Some side effects of the drug are dry mouth, constipation...; Antibiotics: If the prostate is chronically inflamed due to bacterial causes, treatment with antibiotics may improve the symptoms of the disease. However, in cases where the prostate is not inflamed by bacteria, these drugs are not effective.; Herbs: Herbs such as Hoang Dia Hoang, Hoai Son, Phu Linh, Dan Bi, Trach Dia, Xa Tien Tu... are said to have the ability to treat prostate enlargement and are actually applied in many countries. . However, the mechanism of action is currently unknown.\n3. Surgical methods\nIf drug treatment is ineffective, a number of non-invasive or minimally invasive procedures are performed to address the symptoms of prostate enlargement.(5)\nOutpatient intervention\nThese procedures are typically penetrating needle ablation (TUNA), microwave therapy  (TUMT), steam therapy (Rezūm), water thermotherapy (WIT), high-intensity focused ultrasound ( HIFU), Urolift implant…\nBoth the Urolift and Rezūm methods have been proven to provide positive results, are minimally invasive, cost-effective and help maintain better sexual function.\nInpatient intervention\nSome more in-depth intervention procedures may be recommended, if the patient has one of the following problems such as: kidney failure, bladder stones, recurrent urinary tract infections, urinary incontinence, complete inability to ability to expel urine from the bladder, recurrent hematuria...\nIntervention methods include:\nLaparoscopic prostate surgery (TURP): This method is most commonly used for prostate enlargement because it is highly effective. Through the urethra, the doctor inserts a laparoscopic knife into the prostate and cuts them into small pieces. Small pieces will be sucked out and through the endoscope.; Simple prostatectomy: The doctor makes an incision in the abdomen or perineum, the area behind the scrotum. The inner muscle mass of the prostate will be removed, leaving only the outer part. This procedure causes the patient to stay in the hospital for a long time, up to 10 days.; Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP): The doctor will make a small incision in the prostate and bladder neck. This incision helps clear the flow of urine from the bladder. In this case, sometimes the patient does not need to stay in the hospital.",
