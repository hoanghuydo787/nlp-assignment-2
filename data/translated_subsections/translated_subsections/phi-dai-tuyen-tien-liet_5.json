However, early treatment is always more effective and helps you avoid the following possible dangerous complications:\nSudden urinary retention: At this time, you may need to have a catheter inserted into your bladder to drain urine. Some men with the disease need surgery to relieve urinary retention; Urinary tract infection (UTI): Stagnant urine can increase the risk of urinary tract infection. If this happens frequently, you may need surgery to remove part of your prostate.; Bladder stones: Stones can cause infection, bladder irritation, blood in the urine, and block the flow of urine.; Bladder damage. A residual bladder can become stretched and become weak over time. As a result, the bladder muscles do not contract well, causing the patient to urinate uncleanly.; Kidney damage: Pressure from urine stagnation in the bladder can directly damage the kidneys or bacteria can attack the urethra and cause kidney damage.; Effects on overall health: Acute urinary retention and kidney damage can seriously threaten the patient's health.",
