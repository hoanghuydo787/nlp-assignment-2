The patient feels pain and has difficulty moving and moving the limbs, causing difficulty in daily activities. Arm lymphedema is a sequela after breast cancer treatment (accounting for about 10-15%). In particular, this condition can appear in patients who have had axillary lymph node dissection, and the risk is increased in patients who have had axillary radiotherapy.\nLymphedema can appear days, weeks, months or even years after cancer treatment.
