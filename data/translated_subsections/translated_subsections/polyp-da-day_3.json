    "subsection_content": "Stomach polyps are divided into 3 main types. Specifically includes:\n1. Fundic gland polyps\nFundic gland polyps are the most common gastric polyps. They often appear in the bottom or upper part of the stomach. During endoscopy we can see polyps, which are usually small, flat or raised. These polyps rarely develop into cancer. Fundic gland polyps are often associated with long-term use of proton pump inhibitors. In those cases, the doctor may advise the patient to stop taking the medication. (3)\n2. Hyperplastic polyps\nThis is the second most common type of gastric polyp, after fundic adenomatous polyp. This mass of cells often appears in pedunculated or sessile form, with a diameter of less than 2cm, grows in clusters and is scattered everywhere in the stomach, even near ulcers.(5)\nHistologically, this is an increase in Foveolar cells at the surface, creating a spiral shape that extends and penetrates deep into the lamina propria. Gastric hyperplastic polyps may contain pyloric glands, principal cells, and parietal cells and have a histological appearance that may overlap with benign lung tumors (Hamartomas) and inflammation.\nWith hyperplastic polyps, the surface epithelium may also be eroded or ulcerated, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding. That is also the reason why these cell clumps often have a close relationship with disorders that cause inflammation or irritation of the stomach (chronic gastritis, H. pylori gastritis, pernicious anemia... ). In cases caused by H. pylorivi bacteria, successful treatment will help heal hyperplastic polyps.\nNormally, the risk of cancer associated with this type of polyp is not high but can lead to malignant tumors on the stomach lining, especially when the patient has chronic gastritis. In this case, the doctor may perform biopsies of multiple areas around the polyp.\n3. Adenoma polyps\nThis is the most common type of neoplastic polyp, often found near the base of the stomach and is the beginning of stomach cancer as well as a number of other locations in the body. Histologically, adenomatous polyps are classified similarly to colon adenomas with tubular, villous, and branched shapes. This mass of cells is usually distributed singly, most commonly in the cavity but can also appear anywhere in the stomach. Endoscopically, adenomatous polyps are often sessile and large in size.\nAtrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia are highly associated with the development of this type of polyp. In addition, adenoma polyps larger than 2cm with villous histology have a high risk of leading to cancer, specifically about 28 - 40%. In this case, the doctor needs to perform additional tests to accurately diagnose and ensure effective treatment. In addition, removal of all polyps may also be performed to limit the increased risk of cancer. This process is often performed using an endoscope, or even surgery if the number of polyps is large or the cancer has begun to metastasize.\nAdenoma polyps often appear commonly in countries with high rates of stomach cancer such as China, Korea, Japan... Not to mention, the incidence rate in the West also accounts for 6 - 10% of the population. Total number of cases of polyp detection.",
