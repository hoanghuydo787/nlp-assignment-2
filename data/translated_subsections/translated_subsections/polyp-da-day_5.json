An endoscopy is a procedure in which an endoscope, a flexible tube with a camera on one end, is inserted into the mouth and down into the stomach for examination.\nAlthough the majority of stomach polyps (more than 90%) do not lead to cancer, some types of polyps require additional testing to ensure they are free of cancer cells. If an abnormal area is found, a biopsy (tissue sample) can be taken while the endoscope undergoes histopathological testing to look for cancer cells.",
