    "subsection_content": "Treatment of stomach polyps will depend on the type, size and cause of formation. As follows:\n1. Remove polyps\nLarge stomach polyps often have a high risk of developing cancer. For example, in case a cell mass larger than 10mm in diameter is detected during endoscopy, the doctor may decide to remove it immediately. This process is called polypectomy. Specifically as follows:(4)\nFundic adenomatous polyps: If adenomatous polyps are found but are not accompanied by unusual signs, no additional treatment is needed. However, when the cell mass is larger than 10mm in diameter, resection is necessary. If there is dysplasia in the tissue surrounding the polyp, the doctor will perform the same examination as for cancer, possibly even with a colonoscopy.; Fundic adenomatous polyps: If adenomatous polyps are found but are not accompanied by unusual signs, no additional treatment is needed. However, when the cell mass is larger than 10mm in diameter, resection is necessary. If there is dysplasia in the tissue surrounding the polyp, your doctor will perform the same examination as for cancer, possibly even with a colonoscopy.\nHyperplastic polyps: Hyperplastic polyps are usually the only ones tested and examined, especially for H. pylori infection. In some cases, patients will be monitored with endoscopy after one year. After this point, if the polyp is still present or dysplasia is detected in the biopsy, excision will be performed.; Hyperplastic polyps: Hyperplastic polyps are usually the only ones tested and examined, especially for H. pylori infection. In some cases, patients will be monitored with endoscopy after one year. After this point, if the polyp is still present or dysplasia is detected in the biopsy, excision will be performed.\nAdenoma polyps: This type of polyp has a high risk of developing into cancer so it is often removed. If adenomatous polyps are not removed during the first colonoscopy, your doctor will likely repeat the procedure within 6 to 12 months. In addition, examination and biopsy of surrounding areas are also performed to monitor cancer cells as well as other dysplasia.; Adenoma polyps: This type of polyp has a high risk of developing into cancer so it is often removed. If adenomatous polyps are not removed during the first colonoscopy, your doctor will likely repeat the procedure within 6 to 12 months. In addition, examination and biopsy of surrounding areas are also performed to monitor for cancer cells as well as other dysplasia.\nIn case polyps appear too much, gastric bypass surgery can be used to remove part or all of the organ. However, the stomach lining has a special structure with many folds, making this process complicated. Therefore, patients need to consider choosing reputable doctors and hospitals to minimize unwanted risks.\n2. Treat infection\nIf the exam finds an infection or inflammation along with a tumor, your doctor may prescribe medication to treat it. This solution is commonly performed in cases of H. pylori infection.\n3. Should gastric polyps be removed?\nStomach polyp removal is only performed in cases where the cell mass is large in size and has a high chance of developing into cancer. However, the implementation process must follow the doctor's instructions. If the polyp is small, this procedure will likely have more undesirable side effects, such as bleeding.",
