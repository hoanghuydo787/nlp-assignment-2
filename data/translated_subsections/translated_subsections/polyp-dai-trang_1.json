    "subsection_content": "Not all colon polyps are the same. Colon polyps are divided into two main types: hyperplasia and adenoma.\nHyperplasia: This type of polyp has no risk of progressing to the malignant stage into cancer. Hyperplastic polyps are usually small (less than 5mm in size), or located at the end of the rectum or sigmoid colon.; Adenoma: Most cases of colon cancer are from this type of polyp (however, not all adenomas are dangerous). The larger the adenoma polyp, the higher the risk of becoming cancerous. Based on the growth pattern, adenomas are divided into smaller types such as:(3)\nTubular adenoma polyp: most common, accounting for about 80%, size is rarely larger than 25 mm, surface is relatively smooth and often has a stem. Microscopically, the polyp stalk is covered by normal colon mucosa, inside which is fibrovascular-vascular stroma originating from the submucosal layer. The head of the polyp is made up of hyperplastic and dysplastic intestinal epithelium, forming distorted glandular ducts arranged tightly together, and the glandular cells have hyperchromatic nuclei. About 20-25% of tubular adenoma polyps have a branched component, the presence of a branched component makes the polyp more likely to become cancerous. The chance of becoming cancerous is 3-5% for ductal adenoma polyps in general; Tubular adenoma polyp: most common, accounting for about 80%, size is rarely larger than 25 mm, surface is relatively smooth and often has a stem.

The chance of becoming cancerous is 3-5% for tubular adenoma polyps in general.\nVillous adenoma polyp: accounts for 5-15%, with over 75% branch structure, it is called branch adenoma polyp. Mainly found in the rectum (50-55%), pelvic colon (30%) and descending colon (10%). Branch adenoma polyps can be larger than 3cm in size (can reach 100mm), rough like broccoli and stemless. Microscopically, branching adenomatous polyps are made up of hyperplastic and dysplastic intestinal epithelium, forming branch-like structures that resemble intestinal villi. Branch adenoma polyps are precancerous lesions: 10% of tumors have local cancer and 25-40% have invasive cancer.; Villous adenoma polyp: accounts for 5-15%, with over 75% branch structure, it is called branch adenoma polyp.

Branch adenoma polyps are precancerous lesions: 10% of tumors have local cancer and 25-40% have invasive cancer.\nTubular adenoma polyp (tubulo-villous adenoma): accounts for 5-15%, is a mixed form of the above two types. Polyps vary in size, pedunculated or sessile. The branch component accounts for about 25-75%, and may have the appearance of cancer infiltrating the branch component.; Tubular adenoma polyp (tubulo-villous adenoma): accounts for 5-15%, is a mixed form of the above two types.

The branch component accounts for about 25-75%, and may have the appearance of cancer infiltrating the branch component.\nSerrated adenoma polyps: have a serrated structure similar to proliferative polyps but have dysplastic cells, capable of developing into cancer: SSL (sessile serrated lesions), TSA (traditional serrated adenoma). SSL is commonly found in the ascending colon. These polyps have a cloud-like appearance, are often flat, and may be covered with mucus on the surface. Histologically, SSL contains structural abnormalities, significant proliferation, and frequent dysplasia. SSL should be completely excised, however due to unclear borders, care must be taken to ensure complete endoscopic removal of the polyp.

TSA has cellular dysplasia but is usually mild.; Serrated adenoma polyps: have a serrated structure similar to proliferative polyps but have dysplastic cells, capable of developing into cancer: SSL (sessile serrated lesions), TSA (traditional serrated adenoma).
