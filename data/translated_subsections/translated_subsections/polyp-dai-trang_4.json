Colon polyp screening tests include:\nColonoscopy: Helps observe the condition inside the colon. Endoscopy is capable of removing most polyps to check for cancer risk.; CT colonography: This method is also known as virtual colonoscopy to take images of the colon from the outside. This method of diagnosis cannot remove polyps. If there are any abnormal signs, the patient will need regular colonoscopy.; Sigmoidoscopy: This test is similar to colonoscopy but is not too complicated. If the patient has polyps, sigmoidoscopy can remove them.; Stool test: This is a DNA test that tests for genetic changes. If the test has problems, the patient will need an endoscopy.",
