    "subsection_content": "Depending on the type of colon polyp detected, the doctor will choose one of the following removal methods:\nRemoving polyps during colonoscopy: During colonoscopy, the doctor will use forceps or a noose (snare) to remove polyps. If the size of the polyp is too large to be treated in the above way, the doctor will inject a liquid underneath to lift and isolate the polyp from surrounding tissue and then cut the polyp... Polyps can be cut using many different techniques. depending on polyp size; Minimally invasive surgery: For colon polyps that are too large or cannot be safely removed during colonoscopy, minimally invasive surgery will be needed. At this time, the patient will have an instrument called laparoscopic surgery inserted into the abdomen to remove the part of the intestine containing polyps; Colectomy: If you have a genetic condition such as familial adenomatous polyposis, you may need surgery to remove part or all of your colon.\nAfter being removed, colon polyps will be sent for histopathological testing, analyzing tissue samples to assess the degree of dysplasia of the polyp and whether the cut margin still has tumor cells or not.\nIn addition, once you have colon polyps, there is a small risk that you will also encounter more polyps in the future. Therefore, during treatment, patients will be advised to do additional screening tests later. The timing and frequency of testing is based on the number, size, and analysis results combined with other risk factors. Detail:\nIn 5-10 years: When there are 1 or 2 small adenomas; In 3 to 5 years: There are 3 or 4 adenomas; In 3 years: If there are 5-10 adenomas, adenoma size larger than 10mm or certain types of adenomas; Within 6 months to 1 year: When there are > 10 adenoma polyps or 1 large tumor or adenoma, partial resection is required.\nSmall polyps can be removed during a colonoscopy",
