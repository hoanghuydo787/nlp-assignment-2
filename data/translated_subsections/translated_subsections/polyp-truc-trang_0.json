    "subsection_content": "The rectum is the part/position located between the colon and the anal canal; plays a significant role in transporting and eliminating waste from the body. Rectal polyps are a condition in which one or more tumors appear in the rectum; Usually located at the end of the large intestine. The mass of polyp tissue is often mushroom-shaped and sticks to the rectal mucous membrane with a \"stalk\".\nColorectal polyps generally have two types: sessile (flat polyp) and pedunculated, of which the sessile type is more common. There are two different types of polyps with different levels of danger: adenomatous polyps (polyps that develop abnormally) and non-adenomatous polyps (that do not develop abnormally). Accordingly, common types of rectal polyps can be divided as follows:\nTubular adenoma: The cell structure still retains its normal tubular structure. Tubular adenoma accounts for about 70% of cases and is the most common type of polyp.; Tubular adenoma: The cell structure still retains its normal tubular structure. Tubular adenoma accounts for about 70% of cases and is the most common type of polyp.\nHyperplastic polyp: A non-glandular polyp. Hyperplastic polyps are usually small in size. Among all types of polyps, this type of polyp has a low risk of turning into cancer so patients do not need to worry too much when encountering it.; Hyperplastic polyp: A non-glandular polyp. Hyperplastic polyps are usually small in size. Among all types of polyps, this type of polyp has a low risk of turning into cancer, so patients do not need to worry too much when encountering it.\nSerrated polyp: This type of polyp is small (usually less than 5mm), round in shape and has no stem. Serrated polyps are difficult to detect, are a dangerous type of adenoma and are considered a pre-cancerous risk. Depending on the size, histopathological type and degree of dysplasia at the time of detection of the polyp, the tumors have different risks of malignancy.; Serrated polyp: This type of polyp is small (usually less than 5mm), round in shape and has no stem. Serrated polyps are difficult to detect, are a dangerous type of adenoma and are considered a pre-cancerous risk. Depending on the size, histopathological type and degree of dysplasia at the time of detection of the polyp, the tumors have different risks of malignancy.\nInflammatory polyps: Often occur in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. This is not a true polyp but is actually a reaction to chronic inflammation in the rectum. often appears in people with chronic ulcerative colitis or people with colorectal Crohn's disease; Inflammatory polyps: Often occur in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. This is not a true polyp but is actually a reaction to chronic inflammation in the rectum. often appears in people with chronic ulcerative colitis or people with colorectal Crohn's disease.\nBranch duct adenoma: About 5-15% of patients suffer from this type of polyp and is a mixture of the above two types.
