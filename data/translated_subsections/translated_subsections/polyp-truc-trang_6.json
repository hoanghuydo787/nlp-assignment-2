Your doctor will likely completely remove the polyp during the colonoscopy.\nThe polyps are then sent for histopathological testing to see what type of polyp it is and whether there are any cancer cells. In most cases, doctors can usually remove polyps without performing surgery. This operation is performed in conjunction with diagnostic endoscopy - a minimally invasive procedure. However, the patient may still need surgery to remove the polyp if the polyp is large and cannot be removed during endoscopy.\nAfter polyp removal, treatment is not really over. Polyps are still at risk of forming again; Therefore, patients still need to have regular rectal endoscopy (periodic time depends on the number, size and type of polyps previously removed) to be able to detect early if there is a recurrence of polyps.(2)",
