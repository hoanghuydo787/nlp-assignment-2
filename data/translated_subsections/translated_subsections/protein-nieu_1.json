    "subsection_content": "In cases of proteinuria, the doctor will base on the symptoms to determine the underlying cause: (1)\n1. Dehydration\nThis is a common and temporary cause of proteinuria. When the body is dehydrated and the amount of water is not compensated enough, the amount of nutrients delivered to the kidneys will be insufficient, which causes protein reabsorption disorders in the kidneys, leading to protein being excreted in the urine, causing proteinuria. temporary urination.\nSymptoms will vary depending on the severity of dehydration, such as:\nTired.; Headache.; Dizzy.; Constantly thirsty.; Decreased urine output; Dark urine.; Dry mouth, dry skin.\nCauses of dehydration are often due to:\nDiarrhea.; Vomiting.; Excessive sweating.; Fever.; Not drinking enough water.\n2. High blood pressure\nHigh blood pressure causes increased filtration pressure in the glomerulus, which in the long term can damage blood vessels in the glomerulus. This reduces the ability to reabsorb protein, leading to protein leaking into the urine.\nHypertension often develops slowly, so patients may not even feel symptoms for many years. When the disease progresses seriously, the most noticeable signs are often headaches, difficulty breathing or nosebleeds.\nMost cases of high blood pressure have no underlying cause. In some patients, this condition may be caused by:\nKidney disease.; Thyroid disorders.; Difficulty breathing while sleeping; Adrenal tumor.; Side effects from certain medications, such as birth control or decongestants.\n3. Diabetes\nDiabetes is a metabolic disorder that causes blood sugar levels to increase. This forces the kidneys to filter blood more than usual, which, combined with poor blood sugar control, leads to damage to blood vessels in the kidneys and protein leakage into the urine. Symptoms depend on the severity and type of diabetes (type 1, type 2), typically:\nIncreased feeling of thirst and hunger; Frequent urination.; Tired.; Blurred vision.; Unexplained weight loss.\n4. Glomerulonephritis\nNormally, when the glomerulus filters blood, it filters excess water and waste products from the body and proteins that are not filtered through the glomerular membrane. However, if the kidneys are damaged, protein can leak into the urine. Glomerulonephritis can cause nephrotic syndrome, which is manifested by a number of abnormal signs including:\nSwelling of the feet, ankles or legs; Hyperlipidemia, high levels of fat and cholesterol in the blood; High urine protein > 3.5g/24h; Low blood protein concentration, low blood albumin.\nGlomerulonephritis can also cause hematuria (red blood cells appear in the urine). This condition often occurs because the immune system attacks the kidneys.\n5. Glomerulonephritis due to bacterial or viral infection\nSome inflammatory conditions that can cause proteinuria include:\nEndocarditis; HIV.; Hepatitis B.; Hepatitis C.\n6. Chronic kidney disease (CKD)\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition of gradual loss of kidney function, which may have proteinuria in the early stages, but does not manifest into obvious symptoms. As the disease progresses, some common signs include:\nShort of breath.; Frequent urination.; Hiccup.; Tired.; Nausea.; Vomiting.; Difficulty sleeping.; Itchy, dry skin; Swelling of hands and feet.\nThe main causes of chronic kidney disease include:\nGlomerulonephritis.; Interstitial nephritis.; Polycystic kidney disease; Recurrent kidney infections.; Kidney stones; Heart disease.; High Blood Pressure.; Diabetes.\n7. Autoimmune disease\nThe immune system functions to create antibodies (immunoglobulins) to fight the invasion of foreign microorganisms. However, when there is an autoimmune disease, the immune system produces antibodies against the body's own tissues. This can potentially damage the glomerulonephritis leading to proteinuria, which if left untreated can cause kidney failure. Some typical autoimmune diseases include:\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): can cause damage to the skin, joints, and nerves, but can also affect the kidneys.; Goodpasture syndrome: Antibodies attack the kidneys and lungs.; Scleroderma: is an autoimmune disease that damages the skin, joints, heart, kidneys, lungs, and intestines.",
