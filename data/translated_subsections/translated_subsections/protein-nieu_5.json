However, the limits of normal may still vary slightly between laboratories. (5)\nIf urine contains 3 - 3.5 grams of protein per day, the disease is at a nephrotic level. This syndrome is caused by the kidneys leaking too much protein in the urine, leading to a decrease in protein and albumin in the blood.",
