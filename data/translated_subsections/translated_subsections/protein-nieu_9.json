    "subsection_content": "Treatment for proteinuria will be based on the cause of the disease. As follows:\n1. For causes due to diabetes\nYour doctor will develop a treatment plan to help control the disease and slow kidney damage. Useful solutions include:\nCheck blood sugar regularly.; Treatment with medications to control blood sugar and blood pressure; Follow a strict eating plan for people with diabetes.\n2. For the cause of high blood pressure\nFor people with high blood pressure, doctors will prescribe medication to control the index and slow down kidney damage, including:\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors: This is a group of drugs that reduce blood pressure, reduce filtration pressure in the glomerulus by dilating the efferent arterioles, thereby reducing proteinuria and protecting the kidneys.; Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB): This group of drugs also works like ACE. Even if a person does not have diabetes or high blood pressure, a doctor may prescribe ARBs to slow kidney damage.\nDrinking water will not treat the cause of protein in the urine unless the body is dehydrated. In other words, this only dilutes the urine and does not prevent the kidneys from leaking protein. Therefore, in all cases, patients should discuss with their doctor to get the best treatment method.\n3. For the cause of proteinuria due to primary glomerulonephritis:\nTreatment will depend on the type of glomerulonephritis (determined through kidney biopsy). The doctor may prescribe the use of immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, and antihypertensive drugs of the ACE inhibitor/receptor blocker group.\n4. For proteinuria caused by autoimmune disease\nPatients are treated according to autoimmune disease protocols such as lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and Goodspasture syndrome.",
