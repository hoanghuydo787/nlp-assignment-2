(2)\n1. Primary cause (idiopathic)\nIn most patients with generalized sweating causing excessive sweating in the hands and feet without a specific cause, authors around the world found that this group of patients often has an active sympathetic nervous system. Excessive and partly due to genetics.\nSympathetic nervous system\nThe sympathetic nervous system helps control most basic functions of the body, such as the movement of food through the digestive tract; the process of filtering and excreting urine from the kidneys and bladder. In addition, the sympathetic nervous system also acts as an air conditioner. If it senses that the body is too hot, the brain will send a signal to millions of sweat glands in the body to produce sweat (the main component is water). Sweat cools the skin and reduces body temperature.\nThe eccrine gland is closely related to this condition, as it secretes sweat directly into the skin. Furthermore, eccrine glands are highly concentrated in the hands, armpits, feet... these areas are often affected by this syndrome. Scientists believe that, in cases of primary hyperhidrosis, even though there is no need to cool the body, the brain, for whatever reason, sends more signals to the eccrine glands through the nervous system. Sympathy leads to excessive sweating of hands and feet.\nGen\nAccording to experts, some cases are related to immediate parents and siblings, and the cause may be genetic.
