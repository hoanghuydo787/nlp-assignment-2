    "subsection_content": "According to statistics, it is estimated that 35-55% of people with hyperhidrosis have at least one family member who also has this disease. Some other studies have even shown that the condition can be passed down through generations. In reality, this rate may be much higher, but many cases do not report statistics because patients think it is normal and does not affect the disease.\nTherefore, excessive sweating is related to genetics. If one parent has the disease, there is a high chance that their children will also have this disease. If there is a family history of hyperhidrosis, the possibility of inheritance is very high.",
