    "subsection_content": "If the cause of excessive sweating in the hands and feet is found, the doctor will treat the cause and control the sweating. Primary hyperhidrosis is more difficult to treat and may take a long time to be effective. The principle of treatment is to change lifestyle and treat with less invasive methods first, such as daily topical medication to limit sweating in the hands and armpits. (4)\nWhen all minimally invasive medical treatments are ineffective, patients can be advised of other treatment methods such as iontophoresis technology, botulinum toxin injections or sympathetic lymph node surgery. chest to thoroughly treat excessive sweating in the arms, legs and armpits.\n1. Change your lifestyle\nLifestyle changes cannot cure primary hyperhidrosis, but they can improve symptoms and help patients feel more confident in communication:\nLimit sour and spicy foods;; Limiting alcohol intake;; Avoid wearing tight clothes, choose appropriate fabrics, limit artificial fibers such as nylon;; Wearing dark colored clothes (black) can reduce the feeling of wetting due to sweat;; Using armpit absorbent pads helps absorb excessive sweat and protect clothes;; Wear moisture-wicking, thick socks made of natural fibers; Avoid wearing socks made from synthetic materials and change socks at least twice a day if possible.; Wear shoes with super absorbent insoles or highly absorbent sports socks; It is best to wear shoes made of leather and alternate between pairs of shoes every day.\n2. Topical medications limit sweating\nA topical antiperspirant whose main ingredient is aluminum chloride. This is a topical medication that effectively reduces sweating through the mechanism of clogging sweat glands. The patient will apply the medicine at night right before bed and wash it off in the morning. The most common side effect of topical agents is skin irritation or itching at the site of application.\n3. Systemic anticholinergic drugs\nSystemic anticholinergics work by blocking the effects of the chemical acetylcholine. This is a substance used by the nervous system to activate sweat glands, causing increased sweating in the hands and feet. Possible side effects of anticholinergic drugs are dry mouth, blurred vision, stomach cramps, constipation, and difficulty urinating.\n4. Iontophoresis technology\nWith iontophoresis technology, the patient places their hands or feet in a sheet of water and a weak electrical current flows through the water, activating ions that help prevent overactive sweat glands.\nThis method is not painful, but the electric current can cause mild, short-term discomfort and skin irritation. Each iontophoresis procedure lasts 20-30 minutes and will usually need to be performed 2-4 times a week. Symptoms will begin to improve after 1-2 weeks, after which further treatment will be required at 1-4 week intervals, depending on the severity of symptoms.\n5. Botulinum toxin injection\nBotulinum toxin can be injected into the skin in areas of the body affected by hyperhidrosis. The mechanism of this method is to reduce sweating in these areas by blocking nerve signals that stimulate sweat glands.\nThe effects of the injections usually last for several months, after which time the treatment can be repeated if necessary.\nCommon side effects when injecting botulinum toxin include:\nPain, redness, itching at the injection site;; Reactions of nausea, vomiting, headache and heat after injection;; Other parts of the body sweat more to compensate for the treated area (compensatory sweating);; Muscle weakness in the injection area.\nPsychological treatment of anxiety\nFeelings of anxiety do not directly cause primary hyperhidrosis but can make the situation worse and create a vicious cycle. Patients may feel self-conscious and anxious in certain situations, such as when meeting customers or crowded places. Anxiety can make sweating worse. However, sweating will get worse when using anxiety medications.\nThoracoscopic sympathectomy (ETS)\nIn some cases where hyperhidrosis is severe and treatment with less invasive methods is unsuccessful, thoracoscopic sympathectomy (ETS) will be applied. This is the most widely used surgical procedure to treat hyperhidrosis of the hands or armpits.\nAccordingly, the doctor will make a small skin incision of about 6mm in the armpit area to place instruments into the chest and cut off the sympathetic nerve connection that controls the area of ​​increased sweating. The doctor only minimally cuts the active sympathetic nerve segment, so complications of this surgery are almost minimal. When sympathetic connection is lost, nerve signals are no longer transmitted to the sweat glands.\nETS carries a risk of complications such as compensatory sweating after the procedure, and some patients with a history of tuberculosis or previous pleural disease are at risk of lung injury due to adhesions of the lung on the chest wall.",
