(3)\nFor pregnant mothers\nMany pregnant mothers mistakenly think that the placenta is only dangerous to the fetus. In fact, when placenta is attached to the edges, pregnant mothers are at risk of frequent vaginal bleeding, leading to the risk of anemia and a high risk of premature birth.\nFor the fetus\nIf a pregnant mother has anemia during pregnancy, there is a risk that the fetus will also suffer from anemia, malnutrition, and fetal distress right in the mother's womb. In case the mother has severe anemia, the obstetrician is forced to prescribe a cesarean section as soon as possible, regardless of whether the pregnancy is full term or premature.\nIf premature, premature babies are susceptible to respiratory failure. In case the placenta attaches to the lower part of the uterus, there will be a situation of breech presentation due to difficulty turning the head.",
