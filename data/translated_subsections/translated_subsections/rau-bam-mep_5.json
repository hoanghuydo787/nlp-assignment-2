    "subsection_content": "The general principle in treating placenta accreta at the edge of the cervix is ​​to stop the bleeding immediately to ensure the life safety of the pregnant mother. Depending on the age of the fetus and the level of vaginal bleeding, the obstetrician will evaluate and prescribe appropriate blood transfusion to continue the pregnancy or an emergency cesarean section.\nFor pregnant mothers who do not show signs of labor, Dr. Huu Cong recommends that mothers should limit movement, rest a lot, and have a reasonable nutritional supplement diet. If the fetus is full term, monitor and wait for signs of impending birth. If the mother has heavy bleeding, a cesarean section is indicated at any gestational age to stop the bleeding to save the mother.\nFor pregnant mothers in labor, if they notice heavy bleeding, a cesarean section will be indicated. If the bleeding is light and the uterus and fetus are found to be in a favorable position, the amniocentesis will be performed and the membrane will be torn toward the side without the placenta to stop the bleeding. If after tearing the amniotic membrane there is still bleeding, then cesarean section. If there is no more bleeding, vaginal monitoring will continue.",
