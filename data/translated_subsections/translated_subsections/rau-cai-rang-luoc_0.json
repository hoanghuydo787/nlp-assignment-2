(first)\nDoctor II Phan The Thi, Doctor at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Center of Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, said that normally the placenta will detach from the uterine wall after the woman gives birth to the baby. The placenta is then expelled outside.\nHowever, when a pregnant mother has placenta accreta, the placenta cannot detach itself from the uterine wall but clings tightly to the uterine muscles, even invading neighboring organs. This is the cause of postpartum hemorrhage, post-operative infection... even death in pregnant women.\nStudies from the 1970s to 1980s showed that the incidence of this condition was 1/2,510 to 1/4,017. In the years 1982-2002, the incidence rate was 1/533. This increasing rate is due to changes in risk factors, most notably the increase in cesarean section becoming more widely prescribed.",
