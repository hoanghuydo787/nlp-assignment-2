This is the most common form, accounting for 75% of all cases; Increta: The placenta penetrates deep into the uterine wall but does not pass through the uterine serosa. This is a moderately common form, accounting for about 15% of all cases; Percreta form: The placenta invades through the uterine muscle into the uterine serosa, even invading neighboring organs such as the intestines, bladder... Although the Percreta form is the least common, only accounting for about 5% of the total. There are a number of cases, but they are the most serious.",
