However, Dr. Phan The Thi said that most pregnant mothers experiencing this condition have something in common: scars on the uterine wall due to cesarean section surgery or uterine fibroid removal.\nIn addition, pregnant mothers with a history of cesarean section or placenta previa also increase the risk of placenta accreta. Statistics show that about 5-10% of cases are in pregnant mothers with placenta previa.\nA cesarean section increases the risk of the placenta not being able to separate automatically from the uterine wall. The more history a pregnant woman has of old surgical incisions, the greater the risk of encountering this condition. Statistics show that over 60% of cases are in pregnant mothers who have had 3 or more old surgical incisions.",
