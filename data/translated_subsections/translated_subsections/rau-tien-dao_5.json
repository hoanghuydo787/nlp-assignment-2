Detail:\nFor pregnant women\nWhen the disease causes vaginal bleeding to recur many times during pregnancy, it can cause the pregnant woman to have severe anemia and easily give birth prematurely.\nIn the case of a pregnant woman with placenta attached near the cervix, after giving birth, the placenta is dissected, causing the cervix to open, creating favorable conditions for harmful bacteria and germs to penetrate and cause infection. In many cases, a hysterectomy is required if the placenta is tightly attached to the uterine muscle and cannot be separated from the mucosa.\nFor the fetus\nPregnant women with anemia can cause the fetus to be malnourished and not nourished, causing fetal distress. In cases where a pregnant woman has serious bleeding that requires emergency treatment, the doctor will prescribe an emergency cesarean section to save the lives of both the pregnant woman and the fetus. If the fetus is not yet full term, it will be born prematurely and there is a risk of postpartum respiratory failure if there is no supportive intervention.\nIn addition, the placenta is located below the uterus, making it difficult for the fetus to turn its head down, causing disadvantages for the fetus's exit during childbirth. Pregnant women may have to give birth in a breech position (transverse or breech position).",
