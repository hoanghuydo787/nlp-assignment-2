    "subsection_content": "Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said, the general principle when treating placenta previa is to immediately stop the bleeding to save the pregnant woman's life. Depending on the age of the fetus, the level of bleeding, the ability to nourish the fetus and many other factors, the doctor will prescribe an appropriate continuation of the pregnancy or cesarean section.\nDepending on each specific case, the doctor will advise and prescribe appropriate treatment\nFor placenta previa when not in labor\nPregnant women need to have a reasonable rest regime, limit movement and exercise, and build a nutritional regimen that provides enough necessary nutrients for the body.; Doctors may prescribe pregnant women to use tocolytic drugs such as Spasmaverin, Salbutamol, Progesterone.; Using Corticoids helps mature the fetal lungs in cases at risk of premature birth (from 24 weeks to 34 weeks 6 days).; For full-term pregnancy: If placenta previa is central or semi-central, the doctor will prescribe an elective cesarean section at 38 weeks. In the remaining cases, consider continuing to monitor until labor occurs if there is no bleeding.; In case of heavy bleeding or anemia that threatens the life of the pregnant woman: Caesarean section is indicated at any gestational age to stop the bleeding to save the mother.\nFor placenta previa during labor\nIn case of semi-central or central placenta: The doctor prescribes a cesarean section; In case of low placenta: If there is a lot of bleeding, cesarean section is indicated; if there is little bleeding or no bleeding, continue to monitor labor.; In case of placenta accumulating: If there is heavy bleeding, a cesarean section is indicated. If the bleeding is light and the fetus and uterus are in a favorable position, the amnion will be compressed and the amniotic membrane torn toward the side without the placenta to stop the bleeding. If after tearing the amniotic membrane there is still bleeding, then perform a cesarean section; otherwise, if there is no more bleeding, then follow the vaginal route.\nFor placenta previa, complications of placenta accreta\nPlacenta accreta is considered the most serious complication of placenta previa. At this time, blood vessels have proliferated in the lower part of the uterus and begin to penetrate the bladder, often seen in pregnant women with old cesarean section incisions. The surgery is difficult, takes a lot of blood and can cause damage to the bladder.\nIn this case, the doctor will prescribe an active cesarean section when the pregnancy is full term by incision along the uterine body from above the placenta or the bottom of the uterus to remove the fetus. Do not remove the placenta and have a hysterectomy to minimize bleeding. These are extremely difficult and dangerous cases.",
