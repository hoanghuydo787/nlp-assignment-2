    "subsection_content": "Anal fistula (also known as eel vein) is a condition where there is an abnormal tunnel connection between the anal canal and the skin around the anus. This is often the result of an abscess (pus) in the anorectal area that is left untreated or does not completely heal. An abscess occurs when the small mucus-producing glands located just inside the anus become clogged and infected. About 40% of these abscesses may develop into fistulas. However, leakage can also be due to other causes. (first)",
