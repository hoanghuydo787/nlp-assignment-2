    "subsection_content": "During the specialized treatment process, we receive a number of questions from patients about anal fistula and would like to answer each specific question as follows:\n1. Is anal fistula dangerous?\nAnal fistula is usually a benign disease, only causing discomfort and making the patient lose confidence. Although anal fistula is not life-threatening, it requires a reasonable treatment process with patient compliance.\nIf anal fistula is a complication of a type of digestive cancer, this case is especially dangerous. Because digestive cancers, if detected late, often have a poor prognosis with low quality of life.\n2. How long does it take for anal fistula surgery to heal?\nIn simple cases of anal fistula surgery, the patient can be discharged from the hospital in just 2-3 days and after 4-6 weeks the wound will heal completely. For complex surgical cases, the hospital stay and recovery time may be longer, depending on the condition and post-operative care.\n3. Are there any complications after anal fistula surgery?\nAfter anal fistula surgery, if not abstinent and treated properly, complications can occur such as anal bleeding, pus infection, and recurrent fistula. In addition, there may be complications of incontinence (fecal incontinence, gas), depending on the surgeon's skill and the disease condition.\nAfter surgery, complications such as anal bleeding or pus infection may occur\n4. Can anal fistula be cured?\nSurgery can help completely cure anal fistula with proper intervention and care.\nHaving any gastrointestinal health condition is cause for concern, not just anal fistula. It is important that each person needs to improve disease prevention before it happens by having a healthy, scientific diet, lifestyle, and exercise. At the same time, keep the habit of going to the hospital for regular health check-ups and screenings (preferably every 6 months) to early detect possible abnormalities, including anal fistula - Dr. Thai emphasize.\nTo learn about the cost of examination and SCHEDULE ANAL FISTAKE TREATMENT, please contact: Tam Anh Hanoi General Hospital System: 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Bo De Ward, Long Bien District, Hanoi City .
