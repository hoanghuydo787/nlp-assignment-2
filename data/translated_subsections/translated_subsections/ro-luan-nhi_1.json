    "subsection_content": "According to Dr. Thuy Hang, most atrial fistulas do not show symptoms unless infection occurs. In a normal, non-inflammatory state, atrial fistulas usually appear close to the anterior edge of the auricle, and can sometimes also be found along the upper edge of the whorl, tragus or lobule. The fistula is only as small as the tip of a toothpick and when squeezed, you can see milky white sebum like acne, making many people mistakenly think it is a form of acne.\nIn case of infection of the atrial fistula, symptoms such as erythema, itching, swelling, pain, foul-smelling or non-foul-smelling discharge, and recurrent ear discharge will appear. In severe infections, symptoms may include cellulitis, pus collection, accompanied by headache and fever.\nThe most common pathogens that cause fistula infections are Staphylococcal bacteria and, less commonly, Proteus, Streptococcus and Peptococcus types.",
