This is the stage when the fetus is as small as a pea, about 0.6cm long and is starting to form parts such as the nose, eyes, heart valves, hands and feet (but not yet clearly) and external ears.\nTympanic fistula is thought to be incomplete or defective fusion of the six auditory thalamus during the development of the tympanic membrane. Specifically, it is due to the faulty combination between the first and second gill arches during the creation of the fetus's external ear. Genetically, atrial fistula is formed due to a chromosome error.(1)\nSome cases of atrial fistula are associated with certain genetic syndromes, including:\nGill-ear-renal (BOR) syndrome: Can also cause other malformations of the throat and ears, and may be associated with hearing problems and kidney abnormalities. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome: Linked to intra-abdominal problems and kidney and liver cancer; may have a large tongue and asymmetrical earlobes. Orofacial dystonia: Abnormalities of the head and face, including a very small head that does not grow with the body, developmental delays, language problems and intellectual disability, also known as Treacher syndrome Collins. Other syndromes: In addition, spinal dysplasia syndrome; Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome; chromosome 5p deletion syndrome; Chromosomal 11q arm duplication syndrome is also associated with atrial fistula.
