    "subsection_content": "According to Dr. Thuy Hang, if the atrial fistula has no symptoms, there is no need for treatment, only when the fistula is infected. During the period of acute preventricular sinusitis, treatment with appropriate antibiotics is needed. When an abscess is present, incision and drainage is needed. In cases of recurrent or persistent preventricular sinusitis, surgery to remove the sinus along with the path is required and it takes some time for the incision to fully recover.\n1. Medical treatment\nMedical treatment is indicated for acute atrial fistula infection, mainly using antibiotics to prevent infection and combined with warm compresses to relieve painful symptoms.\nAntibiotic treatment: Patients receive the correct type and dosage as prescribed by a specialist. You should not buy antibiotics to take yourself because this can cause antibiotic resistance, leading to many consequences for the treatment of future infections. Warm compress: To reduce symptoms of swelling and pain, the patient can use a clean cotton towel dipped in warm salt water, then wring it dry and gently apply it to the inflamed area. You can do this any time of the day.; Antibiotic treatment: Patients receive the correct type and dosage as prescribed by a specialist.

You can do this any time of the day.\nIf the patient does not respond well to antibiotics, the doctor may prescribe drainage of pus using the following methods.\nPuncture and aspiration of the abscess: The doctor will use a sharp needle to puncture the collection of fluid and drain the fluid. Purulent fluid culture: The doctor will take the pus fluid to culture bacteria in the laboratory. This method helps the doctor choose an antibiotic that responds to the infection.

Surgery for atrial fistula\nDr. Thuy Hang said that there are a number of surgical methods to treat atrial fistula, but doctors often prioritize the patient's personal preferences to decide on the type of surgery. However, local excision with an extended retroventricular incision in a supraventricular approach under general anesthesia has been firmly established by the medical world as having better results and no recurrence rate. . Incomplete resection is the cause of recurrence of atrial fistula infection with an incidence of about 42%.\nThe method of completely removing the preventricular sinus is performed as follows:\nThe doctor will make an elliptical incision around the sinus fossa and extend it superiorly and posteriorly into the retrodural groove. After incision, the physician will perform dissection with a self-retaining mastoid retractor to define the temporal region that forms the medial limit of the dissection, and continue through the cartilage of the anterior whorl, which is considered the posterior margin. of dissection. During the dissection, the doctor will remove the surface tissue of the temporal fascia along with the preventricular sinus. A portion of the cartilage or sunj membrane of the whorl at the base of the sinus is also removed to ensure complete removal of the epithelium in all cases. After the dissection is complete, the doctor will stitch the skin with Silk 3.0 or prolene thread and drain the fluid. After 24 hours of surgery, the bandages and drainage tubes are removed, and the patient is given a course of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs for 5 days. After 7 days, when the wound heals, the stitches can be removed; The doctor will make an elliptical incision around the sinus fossa and extend it superiorly and posteriorly into the retrodural groove.; After incision, the physician will perform dissection with a self-retaining mastoid retractor to define the temporal region that forms the medial limit of the dissection, and continue through the cartilage of the anterior whorl, which is considered the posterior margin. of dissection.; During the dissection, the doctor will remove the surface tissue of the temporal fascia along with the preventricular sinus.
