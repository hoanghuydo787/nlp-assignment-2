    "subsection_content": "Dr. Thuy Hang answers common questions about atrial fistula:\n1. Is atrial fistula dangerous?\nDoctor Thuy Hang said: “Atrial fistula seems to be a benign congenital disease, only worrying when there are signs of infection, but I think atrial fistula should be considered a disease that requires attention. Special attention because it has the potential risk of hearing, cardiovascular, and especially kidney diseases. Kidney defects are associated with common ear problems such as hydronephrosis, horseshoe kidneys, and renal aplasia or hypoplasia.\nIn several studies on the association between congenital malformations of the kidney and urinary tract and malformations of other organ systems, researchers have also suggested that periodic renal ultrasound should be recommended in people with tympanic fistula defects and three or more other mild defects such as: dysfunctional features, genetic syndromes or family history of deafness, eardrum and/or kidney malformations.” .\n2. How long does it take for atrial fistula surgery to heal?\nPatients with preventricular sinus resection are treated with intensive antibiotics for 5 days and on the 7th day the sutures can be removed. However, to fully recover from the wound, it takes about 30 days after surgery.\n3. How long does atrial fistula surgery require in the hospital?\nDepending on each person's ability to recover, the hospital stay after atrial fistula surgery may be longer or shorter. But usually, ear surgery patients with atrial fistula will be treated in the hospital for about 7 days. After the wound is removed, the patient will be discharged from the hospital.\n4. Does atrial fistula surgery leave scars?\nThe surgical wound for the atrial fistula is not large so it does not affect aesthetics. Small scars can be treated with modern scar treatment technologies and they will disappear after the scar treatment process.\n5. Where is a good place to examine and treat atrial fistula?\nAccording to Dr. Thuy Hang, atrial fistula can be very related to congenital defects in the ear, nose and throat, cancer, cardiovascular, kidney, and bronchial systems, so it is best for patients to go for examination at hospitals with good quality. A full range of reputable ENT, Urology, Obstetrics, Cardiology, and Oncology specialties, with modern equipment and experienced doctors to be fully evaluated and given the most accurate diagnosis, from That is the most effective treatment.\nDepartment of Ear, Nose and Throat, Tam Anh General Hospital is a unit that examines, diagnoses and treats ear, nose and throat diseases, including atrial fistula. With a team of skilled and experienced experts and leading doctors, supported by the most modern medical examination and treatment equipment system such as: soft tube ENT endoscope, audiometer, measuring vestibular function, vestibular rehabilitation exercise machine... along with close combination in diagnosis and treatment between ENT, Urology, Cardiology, Obstetrics... help specialized medical examination and treatment.
