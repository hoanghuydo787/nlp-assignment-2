This leads to abnormal changes in the synthesis or degradation cycles of substances in the body. This creates abnormal products that poison cells, impair organ function, and even cause death for children.\nDuring pregnancy, the fetus absorbs nutrients metabolized from the mother. But after birth, the baby provides its own nutrients by breastfeeding, at which point the baby's digestive system begins to function.
