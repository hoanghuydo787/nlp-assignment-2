    "subsection_content": "1. Amino acid metabolism disorders in infants\nAmino acid metabolism disorder is a condition in which mutated genes make enzymes unable to synthesize, decompose or absorb amino acids from protein foods such as meat, fish, eggs, milk, etc. This leads to Accumulation of unmetabolized proteins and formation of abnormal metabolites in cells and organs, causing disease in children.\n2. Fatty acid metabolism disorders in infants\nFatty acid metabolism disorder in newborns is a congenital syndrome that affects the ability to break down fat in newborns. Normally, the body will metabolize glucose from starch and sugar to create energy for life activities and when this energy source is depleted, the body will use stored energy from fat. However, when children have fatty acid metabolism disorder, they will not be able to use fat to produce energy. Therefore, the blood sugar levels of sick children are always low and the blood accumulates many toxic substances.\n3. Organic acid metabolism disorder\nOrganic acid metabolism disorder is a disorder that affects the ability to use amino acids (components to build proteins in the body) and the ability to synthesize and use ketones (organic compounds). produced by the body during the process of burning fat to produce energy) in the body. When using vitamins, proteins and carbohydrates (sugars) in food, patients can develop serious symptoms, even death.\nCommon organic acid metabolism disorders include:\n3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (3MCC) enzyme deficiency; Beta-ketothiolase (BKT) enzyme deficiency; Glutaric acidemia type I (Glutaric acidemia type 1 – GA1).; Hydroxymethyl Glutaric aciduria (HMG) enzyme deficiency; Unable to decompose leucine causing Isovaleric Acid Abnormalities (IVA).; Abnormalities in Methylmalonic acid metabolism (CBI A and CBI B).; Multiple carboxylase enzyme deficiency (MCD).; Propionic acid metabolism disorder (PROP).\nAmong them, 3MCC and PROP are the two most common disorders, with an incidence of 1:75,000 children born each year.\n4. Carbohydrate metabolism disorder: Galactosemia\nCarbohydrate metabolism disorder (Galactosemia) is a condition of excess galactose in the blood. Galactose is a component in lactose, often found in dairy products, especially in artificial milk powder for children. In addition, some other foods may also have small amounts of galactose.\n5. Lysosomal storage disorders: Pompe, MPS, Gaucher, Fabry\nLysosome is an organelle containing hydrolytic enzymes that degrade proteins, complex carbohydrates, nucleic acids, lipids, sulfates and phosphates, forming products that can be reused or discarded. outside the body.\nLysosomal storage disorders are a group of diseases related to about 40 disorders of genes encoding enzymes in lysosomes. The absence or loss of function of an enzyme, after a period of time, will cause accumulation of intermediate metabolic products, leading to destruction of cell structure and function. A large number of cells die causing loss of organ function in the body.\nAmong them, common Lysosome disorders include:\nPompe disease: has an incidence of 1:40,000.; MPS disease: includes MPS-I (1:100,000), MPS-II (1:136,000), MPS-IVA (1:250,000), MPS-VI (1:300,000).; Gaucher disease: has an incidence of 1:57,000.; Fabry disease: has an incidence of 1:40,000.",
