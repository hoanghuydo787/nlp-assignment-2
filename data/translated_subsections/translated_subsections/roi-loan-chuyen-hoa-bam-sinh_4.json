    "subsection_content": "Currently, to detect congenital metabolic disorders early, experts at the neonatal center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City recommend performing fatty acid metabolism screening tests for all newborns, to Early detection of risk factors for disease reduces morbidity, complications and mortality even before the disease has any symptoms. Some tests commonly performed to diagnose congenital metabolic disorders include:\nCarnitine absorption reduction test: Carnitine is a nutrient responsible for converting fat into energy for the body. The state of reduced carnitine absorption will make it impossible to use carnitine to perform this function, leading to metabolic disorders and some muscle diseases, hypoglycemia, etc. Children with this disease often have symptoms such as muscle tenderness, low muscle mass, muscle weakness, frequent fatigue, irritability, poor mobility, swelling, edema, difficulty breathing and hypoglycemia;; Testing for long-chain hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase catalytic enzyme deficiency causing fatty acid oxidation disorder: This is a testing method based on the excessive presence of long-chain hydroxy acids on organic acid analysis and the appearance of carnitine conjugates in an acylcarnitine compound or glycine conjugates in an acetylglycine compound through enzymatic studies in skin fibroblasts. Children with this disease may suffer from cardiomyopathy, rhabdomyolysis, increased creatine kinase, liver abnormalities or neurological diseases, etc.; Testing for very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase catalytic enzyme deficiency: The disease can appear in children before 4 months of age, children nearly 1 year old, and even adults. Symptoms of the disease are often related to serious diseases of the heart muscle;; Test for medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase catalytic enzyme deficiency causing fatty acid oxidation disorder: This is a test method to detect medium chain fatty acid binding compounds of carnitine in plasma, glycine in water urine or detect enzyme deficiency in cultured fibroblasts. Symptoms usually appear when pups are 2-3 months old with manifestations such as: refusal to feed, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, convulsions, coma, hypoglycemia, increased blood ammonia levels and blood ketones. abnormal urine, urine, etc.; Protein-energy deficiency test: This test is performed to quantify serum albumin, check the number of lymphocytes, CD4+ T lymphocytes, transferrin, and the ability to respond to skin antigens;",
