Drugs that are temporarily related to the onset of erectile dysfunction should be treated. discontinue or replace.; Non-invasive methods such as Contraction Rings (For people who cannot maintain an erection long enough) or Vacuum Erection Devices (a vacuum device that pulls blood into the penis through a suction action, then a Elastic ring is placed at the base of the penis to maintain an erection). Disadvantages of this method are penis bruising, cold tip of the penis, and lack of naturalness. If necessary, these tools can be combined with medication.; Treatment is with medication, usually oral phosphodiesterase inhibitors. These drugs control smooth muscle relaxation. In comparative clinical trials, these drugs showed an efficacy of  60 – 75%.; Prostaglandin E1 intracavernous or urethral injection:  Alprostadil (prostaglandin E1), self-administered by penile cavernosal injection or urethral insertion, can produce an erection with an average duration of 30’ to 1 hour.; If other treatment methods fail, surgery to replace the artificial cavernous material may be considered.\n1. How to treat with oral medication?\nRecently, some drugs that help treat erectile dysfunction become simple, non-invasive, highly effective (75 - 80%) and have few side effects are phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors. Currently, there are three groups of commonly used PDE-5 inhibitors: sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil.\n1.1 Effects and effectiveness of the drug\nThese drugs increase blood flow into the penis, helping the patient get an erection. The medicine begins to work and creates the necessary erection after only 10 - 30 minutes of taking it\n1.2 Side effects\nDizziness, headache, facial redness, runny nose, hypotension, visual abnormalities, hearing loss; Indigestion and stomach upset may occur in some cases.; Do not use PDE-5 inhibitors with nitrate drugs (treatment of coronary artery disease). All PDE5 inhibitors cause coronary vasodilation, enhancing the hypotensive effects of other nitrates, including those used to treat coronary artery disease as well as inhaled amyl nitrate (popularly known today as poppers). ). Therefore, concurrent use of nitrates and PED5 inhibitors may be dangerous and should be avoided.\n2. Surgery to treat erectile dysfunction?\nIf medication and vacuum equipment fail, surgical implantation of a penile prosthesis - artificial cavernous body - can be considered.\nProsthetic implants consist of semi-rigid silicone rods and multi-component devices that can be inflated with saline. Both models have the common risks of anesthesia, infection, and graft rejection.",
