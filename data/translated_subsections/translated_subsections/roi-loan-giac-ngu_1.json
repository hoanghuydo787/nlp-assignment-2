    "subsection_content": "Among the types of sleep disorders, below are the 6 most common diseases that we often suffer from:\nInsomnia\nInsomnia is a condition where it is difficult to fall asleep at night, repeatedly for many days. People with insomnia often experience excessive daytime sleepiness and are susceptible to other cognitive impairments while awake.\nIf this sleep disorder lasts a long time, occurring at least three times per week for at least three months, it is considered chronic insomnia. Currently, statistics from the National Sleep Foundation (USA) sleep research organization show that about ⅓ of adults \"live\" with insomnia.\nSleep apnea syndrome\nSleep apnea is also a sleep disorder that causes the patient to have upper airway obstruction every time they go to sleep. There are two main types of sleep apnea: obstructive apnea and central apnea. In addition, there is also mixed apnea which is a combination of the above two types.\nWhen falling asleep, the larynx will narrow, making it more difficult for air to circulate through the pharynx. At this time, the patient will snore to combat the above phenomenon. Or the patient may also stop breathing for a period of time (usually 10 seconds). (2)\nSleep apnea can cause the patient to stop breathing many times while sleeping and have absolutely no memory of this condition even if they wake up after each pause. Like other sleep disorders, sleep apnea can cause excessive sleepiness, fatigue, drowsiness, cognitive impairment, etc. during the day.\nNarcolepsy\nNarcolepsy is a sleep disorder that causes people to feel excessively tired during the day despite getting enough rest the night before. This condition causes you to always be in a state of \"sleepiness\" and may suddenly fall asleep during the day.\nNarcolepsy is a chronic disease that can lead to sudden loss of muscle tone over a short period of time. Narcolepsy and atonic attacks can occur in patients with tumors of the third ventricle and upper brainstem, traumatic brain injury, encephalitis, and Niemann-Pick disease.\nRestless legs syndrome (RLS)\nRestless Leg Syndrome (RLS, also known as Willis-Ekbom disease) is a type of sleep-related movement disorder. This condition causes the patient to feel itchy, painful, and uncomfortable in the legs and feel like they want to move their legs even while sleeping. (3)\nIn some cases, people with restless legs syndrome may also feel discomfort in their hands or other parts. Only when the foot moves can it feel more comfortable.\nThis sleep disorder is often mild in the morning and becomes more severe each night.\nRestless legs syndrome makes you constantly want to move while you sleep\nParasomnias\nParasomnias is a condition of \"false insomnia\" - a relatively common sleep disorder today. People with pseudoinsomnia may have unusual behaviors before falling asleep or during sleep. (4)\nSleepwalking, talking in sleep, moaning in sleep, having nightmares, wetting the bed, etc. are common behaviors of people with this sleep disorder. Symptoms of this sleep disorder often occur in children, but sometimes adults can also experience it.\nCircadian sleep disorder\nSleep rhythm disorder, also known as circadian rhythm sleep disorder, is a condition in which it is difficult to fall asleep, wake up too early but cannot go back to sleep, wake up during the sleep cycle, etc. Sleep disorder This includes forms such as: delayed sleep phase disorder, advanced sleep phase disorder, sleep disorder due to shift work, irregular sleep-wake rhythm, irregular sleep-wake syndrome 24 hours,…\nIn addition to the 6 types of sleep disorders mentioned above, there are many other types of sleep disorders such as idiopathic oversleeping, Kleine-Levin syndrome (sleeping beauty syndrome), sleep paralysis, etc.",
