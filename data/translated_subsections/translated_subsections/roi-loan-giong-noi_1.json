Laryngitis\nLaryngitis is one of the most common voice disorders\nLaryngitis occurs when the vocal cords become irritated and swollen, causing the patient to become hoarse or even lose their voice. Acute laryngitis is usually caused by an upper respiratory virus and lasts only a few weeks. Meanwhile, chronic laryngitis lasts longer and is mostly related to diseases such as chronic cough, asthma or gastroesophageal reflux.\n2. Vocal cord paralysis\nIn some cases, the vocal cords may be partially or completely paralyzed. The cause of this condition may be that the laryngeal nerve is affected by infection, trauma during surgery, stroke or cancer.\n3. Spasmodic dysphonia\nThis is a neurological disease that affects the functioning of the vocal cords, causing the muscles in the larynx to contract involuntarily. This can cause the voice to become shaky, broken, weak, hoarse...\n4. Polyps, fibroids or laryngeal cysts\nPolyps, fibrous nodules or laryngeal cysts are benign lesions of the vocal cords. The formation of these lesions affects the normal functioning of the vocal cords, causing changes in the voice.\n5. Laryngeal cancer\nLaryngeal cancer is a malignant tumor of the vocal cords, most commonly laryngeal carcinoma. This type of cancer can cause voice disorders, causing the voice to become hoarse and persistent, causing difficulty breathing. (first)",
