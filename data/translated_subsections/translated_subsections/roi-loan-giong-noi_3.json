    "subsection_content": "When we talk, air from the lungs pushes up and passes through the vocal cords. The vocal cords are elastic folds of mucous membrane located inside the larynx. When air flows through, the vocal cords are pulled closer together, vibrating and creating sound.\nFor sound to come out normally when speaking, the vocal cords need to work smoothly inside the larynx. Anything that interferes with the movement or contact of the vocal cords can cause a voice disorder. Possible causes of this disorder include:\n1. Voice abuse\nExcessive use of the voice is the leading cause of voice disorders\nVoice overuse can also cause voice disorders. Vocal abuse is anything that strains or harms the vocal cords, such as talking too much, shouting, or coughing. Smoking and constantly clearing your throat are also vocal abuse behaviors.\nVocal abuse can cause the vocal cords to stretch, become fibrotic, or develop abnormal growths. These change the sounds that come out of the throat. In some cases, the vocal cords can rupture due to vocal abuse, causing bleeding and even loss of voice if not treated promptly.\n2. Abnormalities in laryngeal structure\nAbnormalities in the structure of the larynx can affect the voice. These abnormalities can be congenital (trochanteric membrane, vocal fold groove...) or acquired (laryngeal injury, narrow airway scar...)\n3. Inflammation and edema of the vocal cords\nSurgery, respiratory diseases, allergies, gastroesophageal reflux, chemical exposure, smoking, drinking too much alcohol, using certain medications, and vocal abuse can cause inflammation and swelling. inflammation, affecting the normal functioning of the vocal cords.\n4. Benign/malignant lesions in the larynx\nBenign lesions such as cysts, papillomas, granulomas, fibroids or polyps can form on the vocal cords, preventing normal vocal cord function.\nOn the other hand, malignant tumors can also develop in the larynx, causing voice disorders and many other symptoms such as sore throat, earache, lump in the throat, prolonged cough, difficulty breathing, weight loss...\n5. Problems with the nerves that control the voice\nSome conditions can affect the nerves that control the vocal cords, including multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, etc. Nerves can also be affected by previous surgeries.\n6. Hormonal disorders\nDisorders that affect thyroid hormones, sex hormones, and growth hormones can cause voice disorders.\n7. Psychological problems\nVoice characteristics can also be affected by psychological stressors or other psycho-psychological problems. Patients suspected of having a psychological voice disorder should see a psychologist or psychiatrist for examination, diagnosis and treatment.
