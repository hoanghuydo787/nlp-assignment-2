Clinical examination\nDoctor Tran Thi Thuy Hang, Department of Ear - Nose - Throat, Tam Anh General Hospital is examining a patient with signs of voice disorder.\nThe doctor will ask about the symptoms the patient is experiencing as well as listen to the patient's pronunciation to evaluate the voice disorder.\nThe doctor may also perform a more thorough examination of the vocal functions of the larynx by performing a laryngoscopy.\nCommonly used laryngoscopy methods include:\nRigid laryngoscopy: The doctor uses a rigid laryngoscope to pass through the mouth and down the throat to observe the pharynx, larynx and other related structures.; Flexible laryngoscopy: The doctor uses a small endoscope to pass through the nose and down the throat to examine and examine this area. Endoscopy time is about 10 - 15 minutes.\nRigid and flexible endoscopy can be combined with stroboscopy of the larynx - which is to examine the larynx with a flashing light that captures slow moving images of the vocal cords to observe vibration and activity. opening and closing of the vocal cords. The stroboscopic endoscopy method plays an important role in diagnosing conditions that cause voice disorders, helping to significantly improve the accuracy of laryngeal diagnosis compared to endoscopic techniques using conventional light sources. .\n2. Paraclinical\nThe doctor may prescribe a number of necessary tests and paraclinical examinations to support the diagnosis of voice disorders such as:\nVoice sound analysis: Through analysis from specialized machines and equipment, doctors can measure abnormalities in the sounds produced by the vocal cords.
