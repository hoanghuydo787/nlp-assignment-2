Menorrhagia\nMenstrual bleeding is considered heavy (menorrhagia) if it interferes with daily activities and work. Normally, the amount of blood lost during each period is about 50-150ml. If a woman loses a lot of blood, 10-25 times the normal amount of blood during each period, or has to constantly change sanitary napkins every hour instead of 3-4 times a day, that is menorrhagia.\nMenstrual disorders, if severe, can cause patients to have to temporarily stop daily activities and work just to deal with excessive menstrual blood.\nMenorrhagia causes women to have to change many sanitary napkins every hour, affecting daily activities and work.\nMenorrhagia can appear at different stages in a woman's life, and can appear in her teenage years when she begins to menstruate, or in her 40s and 50s when she women entering perimenopause.\nIn addition, menorrhagia also comes from many other causes such as:\nHormone imbalance in the body; Inflammation of the cervix or uterus; Fibroids.; Side effects of using intrauterine contraceptive devices; Hypothyroidism (due to underactive thyroid).; Changes in diet or exercise.\n\"Any situation of menorrhagia needs to be examined and examined to find the cause for timely intervention and treatment, avoiding unfortunate complications that may occur,\" Dr. Hoang Duy emphasized.\n2. Amenorrhea\nSome women may experience the opposite situation of menorrhagia, which is the complete absence of menstruation, called amenorrhea or amenorrhea. Amenorrhea is considered normal before puberty, during pregnancy and after menopause. If you do not have monthly menstruation and do not belong to the 3 groups mentioned above, you should see a doctor immediately to get advice from a doctor on appropriate intervention solutions.\nThere are 2 types of amenorrhea, including:\nPrimary amenorrhea: a case where a woman has turned 16 years old but still has not had menstruation. Caused by abnormalities in the endocrine system, problems in the ovaries, hypothalamus or genetic abnormalities.; Secondary amenorrhea: a case in which a woman has regular menstruation but suddenly stops menstruating for 3 months or longer. The cause may be due to hormonal disorders in the body, problems with the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, ovarian cysts or surgical removal of the ovaries.\n3. Menstrual cramps\nMost women experience menstrual cramps before or during their period at some point in their lives. In some people, symptoms of menstrual cramps occur mildly every month. However, if the condition is painful and prolonged, called dysmenorrhea, women need to consult a doctor for proper health care.\nWomen may experience menstrual pain such as cramps due to uterine contractions under the activation of Prostaglandin - a hormone-like substance produced by uterine lining cells and circulating in the blood. When having dysmenorrhea, women may feel diarrhea or faint, become pale and sweat a lot because Prostaglandin speeds up uterine contractions, dilates blood vessels, lowers blood pressure and causes dizziness. face.\nIf you have severe menstrual cramps, you need to see a doctor immediately to get proper pain relief instructions from a doctor\n4. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)\nPremenstrual symptoms usually appear about 5-7 days before your period begins, and disappear as soon as your period begins or shortly thereafter. Some women experience a range of physical and emotional symptoms, while others experience few or no symptoms. A survey found that about 30-40% of women may experience severe premenstrual symptoms, affecting daily activities and work.\nPhysical premenstrual symptoms include:\nFull stomach;; Tightness, swelling and tightness in the chest;; Headache;; Constipation.\nEmotional premenstrual symptoms include:\nEasily angry and irritable;; Anxiety and confusion;; Stress, mood swings;; Inability to concentrate;; Depression.\nDoctor Hoang Duy shared that premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is caused by an increase and decrease in Estrogen and Progesterone levels in the body, affecting substances in the brain, such as Serotonin - a substance that has the ability to Strong influence on mood and emotions.\nIt is currently unclear why some women with menstrual irregularities develop premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD â€“ the most severe form of PMS), while others do not. Some researchers suspect that these cases are more susceptible to changes in hormone levels in the body.\n5. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)\nPremenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is the most severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). About 3-8% of women who experience PMDD symptoms say it severely affects their quality of life.\nThe most common symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are irritability, anxiety, and mood swings. Women with a history of depression, postpartum depression or mood disorders are at higher risk of premenstrual dysphoric disorder than other women.",
