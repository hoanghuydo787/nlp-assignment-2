Cholesterol and triglycerides (triglycerides) are the two most common types of lipids that cause disease conditions. Specifically: (1)\nLDL cholesterol: considered “bad cholesterol” because it contributes to the formation of plaque in blood vessels; HDL cholesterol: considered “good cholesterol” because it helps remove LDL from the blood.; Triglycerides: formed and developed when calories are not burned immediately, stored in fat cells.\nCholesterol is present in the body's cells. Triglycerides are also found in cells and in dietary fats (such as white fats in meat, oils, and dairy products). The liver also produces cholesterol and triglycerides.",
