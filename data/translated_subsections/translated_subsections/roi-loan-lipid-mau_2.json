    "subsection_content": "Lipid disorders are divided into two types: primary and secondary. If primary dyslipidemia is genetic, secondary dyslipidemia is an acquired condition (developing from other causes such as obesity, diabetes, etc.).\nThere are many types of primary lipid disorders, such as:\nHyperlipidemia or familial high cholesterol: This is the most common genetic cause of both high LDL cholesterol and high triglycerides. If hyperlipidemia is familial, the person may develop these problems in their teens or early 20s, often with a history of having a parent with high lipid disorders.; Familial hypercholesterolemia and polygenic hypercholesterolemia: Both are characterized by high total cholesterol.; Familial hyperapobetalipoproteinemia: This condition means high levels of apolipoprotein B (a protein and part of LDL cholesterol).\nSecondary causes:\nSedentary lifestyle, eating too many calories; Internal diseases: Diabetes, kidney failure, liver failure\nHyperlipidemia can have primary or secondary causes. If you have this condition, your body will have difficulty breaking down LDL cholesterol or triglycerides.",
