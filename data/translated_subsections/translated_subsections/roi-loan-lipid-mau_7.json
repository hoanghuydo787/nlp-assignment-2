Treatment goals are often based on LDL targets, LDL targets will change depending on whether the patient is a high, medium or low risk group.\nHigh LDL cholesterol is often treated with statins, which interfere with cholesterol production in the liver. If statins do not improve triglyceride and LDL levels, your doctor may recommend additional medications such as: ezetimibe, niacin, fibrates, bile acid sequestrants, evolocumab and alirocumab, lomitapide and mipomersen.",
