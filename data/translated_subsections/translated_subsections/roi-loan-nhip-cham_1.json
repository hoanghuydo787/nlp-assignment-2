Some people have a slow heart rate but it is not a disease, such as athletes, or people's heart rate while sleeping,\" Dr. Binh added.\nSome drugs can cause slow heart rate, especially drugs used to treat other heart diseases such as drugs to treat high blood pressure, drugs to treat heart failure...\nIn some cases, bradycardia is also a pathology. This could be due to:\nCardiac pacemaker (sinus node) abnormality.; Aging of heart tissue.; Impairment or damage to the rhythm transmission system in the heart; Congenital heart disease.; Coronary heart disease.; After heart surgery.; Severe infection.; Sleep apnea.; Electrolyte disorders; Hypothyroidism.; Immune disease (systemic lupus erythematosus...).",
