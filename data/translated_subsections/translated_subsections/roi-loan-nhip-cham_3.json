During the examination, the doctor will check the patient's pulse and listen to the patient's heartbeat. (3)\nTo know the basic electrical activity of the patient's heart, the doctor will order the patient to have an electrocardiogram (ECG). However, ECG measurement only records the heart's electrical activity for a short time. To monitor a patient's heart rate for a longer period of time, such as a day or multiple days, the doctor will prescribe a long-term continuous electrocardiogram (Holter ECG).\nWhen the patient wears Holter ECG, the patient can still live as usual. It is recommended that patients record symptoms that occur during the Holter ECG procedure, based on which the doctor will have a basis to help accurately diagnose the disease and provide appropriate and effective treatment.\nWhen wearing Holter ECG, patients can still function normally\nAfter the doctor knows for sure that the patient has a slow arrhythmia, the doctor may ask the patient to do additional clinical tests to find the cause, including:\nBlood tests;; Echocardiography;; Measure drug concentrations that affect heart rate (if any).; Electrophysiological survey to evaluate the functioning of the sinus node, conduction pathways...",
