    "subsection_content": "Normally the heart has 4 chambers. The two smaller, upper chambers of the heart are called the atria. The remaining two heart chambers are larger in size, located below, called ventricles. Normal heart rhythm is generated by a structure in the heart, located in the right atrium called the sinus node. The electrical impulse generated by the sinus node will spread to the atria of the heart, then this impulse will pass to the ventricles through the atrioventricular node and conducting branch bundles. These electrical impulses are emitted by the sinus node and transmitted throughout the heart rhythmically in continuous waves, helping the heart contract to create heartbeats. The formation and propagation of these electrical impulses help control the beating of the heart and create a heartbeat.\nBecause normal heart rhythm is generated by the sinus node, normal heart rhythm is also called sinus rhythm. Sinus rhythm frequency (number of heartbeats per minute) is not fixed but changes appropriately according to physiological status, body activities and surrounding environmental conditions. Therefore, sinus rhythm is the body's best and most suitable rhythm.",
