These causes may be abnormalities or diseases of the heart itself, or diseases in other organs that affect heart rhythm (for example, thyroid disease, kidney failure causing electrolyte disorders). ). Arrhythmias can occur transiently in just a few minutes or less, appearing in waves without any previous warning signs. However, some arrhythmias last for many hours, even continuously for many years.\nThe causes of arrhythmia are:\nSinus node activity becomes abnormal or impaired;; There is another source of abnormal rhythm in the heart;; There are abnormal conduction pathways in the heart;; The heart's normal conduction system is damaged (blocked);; Damaged heart muscle;; Electrolyte disorders cause arrhythmia;; Due to drugs or toxins;; Due to abnormalities of other organs that affect the heart (eg hyperthyroidism).",
