    "subsection_content": "Some mild arrhythmias usually do not cause any harm to health. However, other arrhythmias, especially arrhythmias that cause symptoms as described above, if not detected and treated promptly, can be life-threatening or lead to serious complications such as:\nStroke: People with arrhythmia are 5 times more likely to have a stroke than healthy people. That's because when you have arrhythmia, blood cannot circulate to all parts of your body, increasing the possibility of blood clots forming. Blood clots that form in the atria can travel to the brain, blocking/narrowing blood vessels leading to stroke.; Reduced ability to exercise, limited activities/living: To move, exercise and perform daily activities, the body needs a continuous supply of oxygenated blood. Unfortunately, if you have arrhythmia, your heart cannot pump enough blood to other parts, leaving you in a constant state of fatigue and weakness.; Heart failure: The heart pumps blood to other parts of the body to maintain vital activity. However, when you have an arrhythmia, the heart cannot effectively pump blood to where it is needed. Therefore, the heart has to work harder and becomes weaker. This will interfere with the normal functioning of the heart, causing heart failure.; Sudden death: Some arrhythmias are latent, patients are asymptomatic or have unclear transient symptoms. However, when the patient has recurrent and severe arrhythmias, it can lead to sudden death. One of the main causes of sudden death in young people is severe cardiac arrhythmias, often due to genetic mutations that cause severe arrhythmias.",
