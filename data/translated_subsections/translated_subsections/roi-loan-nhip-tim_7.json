    "subsection_content": "To diagnose arrhythmia, an arrhythmia specialist will examine and evaluate your general cardiovascular condition, asking about your medical history and related symptoms. The doctor will conduct tests to diagnose and evaluate the severity of the arrhythmia (if any). Through clinical examination and the results of necessary tests, the doctor will advise the patient on the disease condition and advise appropriate treatment options.\nIt should also be noted that some arrhythmias are intermittent or transient in nature. When the patient has returned to a normal rhythm (due to the arrhythmia ending on its own) and comes for examination, the examination results may be normal, abnormal signs cannot be detected, making it difficult to diagnose the disease. Therefore, once a patient has symptoms suspected to be related to arrhythmia, he or she should see an arrhythmia specialist as soon as possible, especially while symptoms persist.\nParaclinical tests commonly prescribed to diagnose arrhythmia are:\nElectrocardiogram (ECG): During an electrocardiogram, sensors (electrodes) that detect the heart's electrical activity are attached to the chest, arms, or legs. This method aims to measure the duration of each electrical phase in the heartbeat.; 24-hour Holter ECG: This portable ECG monitor can be worn for one or more days to record electrical activity over a longer period of time to increase the likelihood of detecting disorders. heartbeat. The device is useful in evaluating suspected arrhythmia-related symptoms as well as monitoring response during treatment. The machine is also used to screen and detect patients at risk of arrhythmia for timely treatment.; Event recorder: used to detect sporadic arrhythmias. The device is usually worn for long periods of time (up to 30 days or until you develop typical arrhythmia symptoms).; Echocardiogram: A handheld device (transducer) placed on the chest that uses sound waves to create images of the size, structure, and movement of the heart.; Implantable loop recorder: If symptoms are infrequent, your doctor will implant a device under the skin in the chest area to continuously record the heart's electrical activity and detect irregular heartbeats.\nHolter ECG machine is used to monitor heart rate.\nIf the arrhythmia is still not found in the above laboratory tests, the doctor may trigger the arrhythmia using other methods, such as:\nStress testing: Some arrhythmias are triggered or worsened by strenuous exercise. During exercise testing, your heart's activity is monitored while you ride a stationary bike or exercise on a treadmill. If you have bone and joint diseases that interfere with performing the test, your doctor may use a drug to stimulate the heart to work similarly to exercise.; Tilt table test: Your doctor will perform this method if you have fainting of unknown cause. You will have your electrocardiogram, heart rate and blood pressure continuously monitored in the lying position and when the table is tilted steeply, combined with the use of medication. This test can reproduce the fainting episode to assess the cause and severity of the disease to guide appropriate treatment methods.; Electrophysiology survey and mapping: In this test, doctors thread thin, flexible tubes (catheters) with electrodes attached through blood vessels to different areas in the heart.
