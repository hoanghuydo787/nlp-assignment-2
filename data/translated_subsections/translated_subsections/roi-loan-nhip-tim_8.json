    "subsection_content": "Treatment for arrhythmia depends on whether you have a fast heart beat (tachycardia) or a slow heart rate (bradycardia). Some arrhythmias do not require treatment. Your doctor will do regular checkups to monitor your condition.\nCommonly applied treatments are:\nUse medicine\nThe choice of medication to treat arrhythmia depends on the type of arrhythmia and potential complications. For example, medications that control heart rate and restore normal heart rhythm are often given to patients with tachyarrhythmias. If you have atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, anticoagulants will help prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of stroke. It is important to take medication exactly as directed by your doctor to achieve effective treatment and prevent complications.\nProcedure/surgery\nTypes of procedures and surgeries used to treat arrhythmias include:\nCatheter ablation: In this procedure, the doctor threads one or more catheters through the blood vessels to the heart. Electrodes at the tip of the catheter use heat or cold energy to create small scars in the heart, blocking abnormal electrical signals and restoring normal heart rhythm.; Pacemaker: If the bradycardia is not due to correctable causes, doctors often treat it with a pacemaker because there aren't any medications that increase the heart rate as effectively as a pacemaker. .; Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD): This device is often fitted to patients who develop a fast or irregular heartbeat in the lower chambers of the heart (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation). If you have had a sudden cardiac arrest or have certain heart conditions that increase your risk of sudden cardiac arrest, your doctor may also recommend an ICD.; Maze surgery: For Maze surgery, the doctor makes a series of incisions in the heart tissue in the upper half of the heart (atria) to create a maze of scar tissue. Because scar tissue does not conduct electricity, it blocks stray electrical impulses, thereby helping to treat some types of arrhythmias.; Coronary artery bypass surgery: If you have severe coronary artery disease leading to arrhythmia, your doctor will perform coronary artery bypass surgery. This surgery restores blood flow to the heart and may help improve heart function.\nDoctors at Tam Anh General Hospital conducted interventions to investigate and eliminate arrhythmias.",
