    "subsection_content": "After giving birth, a woman's body undergoes many hormonal changes to regulate recovery and milk production. However, postpartum hormonal imbalance can occur, causing unwanted symptoms such as insomnia and psychological imbalance. Here are some ways to help balance hormones after giving birth:\n1. Stay away from harmful substances\nNicotine, alcohol and caffeine are substances that can worsen postpartum hormonal imbalance. Therefore, mothers need to avoid drinking alcohol, smoking and drinks containing caffeine such as coffee.\n2. Use vitamin supplements\nThe balance of vitamins and minerals in the body also helps restore hormonal balance. Therefore, after giving birth, don't forget to take vitamin supplements every day. Remember to consult your doctor before taking any medicine or vitamin because any food can be transmitted to your baby through breast milk, so safety should be a top priority. .\n3.

Walking is a great way to help your body exercise and relax.\n6. Increase fiber intake every day\nPostpartum women should supplement lots of fiber-rich foods such as green vegetables, broccoli, lentils, peas, etc. to eliminate estrogen content in the body.\nPeas help supplement fiber for postpartum mothers.\n7. Do not eat foods rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids\nThese foods can affect the endocrine glands and make symptoms of imbalance worse.
