    "subsection_content": "Hormonal disorders after pregnancy are a common and common problem in women. Below are some frequently asked questions related to postpartum female hormone disorders:\n1. How do postpartum hormones change in the first days?\nThe moment a baby is born is always the most unforgettable moment for a woman. How long labor lasts has no bearing on how happy you are when you meet your baby for the first time. However, postpartum hormonal changes can occur within the next few days. Characteristics of early postpartum hormonal imbalance include:\nImmediately after the baby is born, progesterone and estrogen levels drop.; A spike in oxytocin occurs immediately after birth to compensate for the drop in estrogen and progesterone levels. Hormones are tied to a woman's emotions and maternal instincts.; Prolactin increases rapidly to stimulate lactation.\n2. Hormones in the 3rd to 6th week after birth\nAfter the first few weeks a woman will likely start to feel more emotionally stable and gradually get used to taking care of her baby. About 6 weeks after giving birth, symptoms of postpartum depression may appear as hormone levels begin to change. These changes may include reluctance to shower or not paying attention to hygiene, fear of leaving the baby with someone else, not being able to get enough sleep due to constant babysitting and loss of appetite, and not wanting to leave the house or interact. with people around.\nAfter the first few weeks a woman will likely start to feel more emotionally stable and gradually get used to taking care of her baby.\n3. Hormones at 3 months after birth\nDuring the 3 months after giving birth, the mother has gradually formed new habits in her lifestyle to conveniently take care of the baby. However, hormone levels at this time have not yet restored to normal as before giving birth. During this time, hormone levels gradually return to pre-pregnancy levels. However, cortisol levels continue to increase due to the many stresses encountered during the process of caring for the baby. Lack of sleep or poor sleep reduces melatonin and serotonin levels. This postpartum hormonal change can have a negative impact on a woman's psychology.\n4. Hormone levels at 6 months after birth\nDepending on whether the baby is bottle-fed or breast-fed, postpartum hormone levels will be very different at this time. The peak of postpartum endocrine disorders is the decrease in prolactin levels when the baby begins to reduce breastfeeding. This hormone should always increase during breastfeeding, but when your baby starts eating solid foods, prolactin levels will begin to drop. Even if you continue to breastfeed after 6 months, your baby's milk needs will still be adjusted and you will not produce as much milk as before. For breastfeeding women, hormone levels are suppressed longer (the more breastfeeding, the longer the suppression period).\n5. When will hormone levels return to normal?\nThe timing will vary depending on each person's constitution, but about 6 months after giving birth, many hormones in the mother's body will return to the way they were before pregnancy. At this time, hormonal changes in estrogen and progesterone will return to pre-pregnancy levels, and many women have their first postpartum period around this time.\n6. Why can hormonal imbalance lead to postpartum depression?\nAllopregnanolone is a steroid that the brain produces and occurs naturally from the breakdown of progesterone. During pregnancy allopregnanolone levels will increase steadily until the third trimester, but  after childbirth this steroid begins to decline rapidly. In many cases, allopregnanolone levels will increase a few days after giving birth, but if this does not happen, this is the cause of depression.\nChanges in hormone and allopregnanolone levels during pregnancy can affect the activity of GABA receptors, a type of receptor in the brain that plays a role in mental health conditions that can also trigger depression. present with postpartum depression.\nEndocrinology - Diabetes Department of Tam Anh General Hospital with a team of doctors and experts with many years of experience and modern machinery and technology system will help symptoms of postpartum hormonal disorders quickly end. Mother and baby are both healthy and happy.\nGiving birth will bring many changes to a woman's body, including postpartum hormonal disorders. Postpartum hormonal disorders are a common problem and can gradually improve over time. Women should have regular check-ups after giving birth to receive advice from doctors on effective measures to improve symptoms.",
