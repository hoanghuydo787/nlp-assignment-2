    "subsection_content": "The endocrine system consists of a series of interconnected organs and glands, responsible for producing and secreting endocrine hormones, playing an important role in controlling and regulating metabolism and metabolism. energy metabolism, reproduction, development as well as the body's response to stress, injury, and mood. (first)\nThe endocrine system includes:\nHypothalamus: located at the base of the brain near the optic chiasm, has the function of secreting hormones that stimulate or inhibit hormone secretion of the pituitary gland, controlling water balance in the body, temperature, appetite, sleep and blood pressure.; Pituitary gland: is a small endocrine gland the size of a pea located in the lower part of the brain. It is a central endocrine gland that commands and controls the functions of other endocrine glands in the periphery.; Pineal gland: located below the corpus callosum, in the middle of the brain, secretes the hormone melatonin to help control sleep; Thyroid and parathyroid glands: located in front and below the neck, below the larynx. The thyroid gland plays an important role in the body's metabolism. The parathyroid gland plays an important role in regulating the body's calcium balance.; Thymus: located in the upper part of the chest, in the chest behind the sternum, has the function of creating immune cells that help the body fight infections and destroy abnormal cells.; Adrenal glands: there are 2 adrenal glands located above each kidney. Like many other endocrine glands, the adrenal glands function in close association with the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. The adrenal glands create and release corticosteroid hormones and catecholamines to help maintain blood pressure and regulate metabolism.; Pancreas: located behind the stomach. The pancreas plays an important role in the digestive process, as well as the production of endocrine hormones. Hormones produced by the pancreas include insulin and glucagon, which help regulate blood sugar levels.; Ovaries: located deep in the female pelvis, on both sides of the uterus, connected to the uterus through the fallopian tubes. In addition to containing egg cells necessary for reproduction, the ovaries also produce estrogen and progesterone, which play an important role in maintaining female characteristics and metabolism in the female body.; Testicles: located in the male scrotum, play a role in producing sperm for reproduction and testosterone to help maintain male characteristics.",
