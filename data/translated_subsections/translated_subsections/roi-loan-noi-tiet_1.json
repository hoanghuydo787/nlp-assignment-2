(also called primary disorders).\nSecondary disorders originate from the pituitary gland and hypothalamus, causing inhibition or excessive stimulation of peripheral endocrine glands.\nA more rare cause is due to abnormal response of target organs to endocrine hormones (often causing functional impairment).\nDisorders can lead to increased hormone production causing hyperfunction or decreased hormone production causing dysfunction.\nThere are different types of endocrine disorders depending on the endocrine glands and the related hormones of each gland.",
