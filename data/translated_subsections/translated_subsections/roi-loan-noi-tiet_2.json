    "subsection_content": "Each different endocrine disorder will have specific symptoms depending on the disease. Common endocrine disorders:\nDiabetes: occurs when the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin or has insulin resistance, leading to increased blood sugar levels. If blood sugar levels increase, it will lead to symptoms such as: weight loss, increased thirst, increased drinking, frequent urination, slow healing of ulcers, increased risk of infections, especially tuberculosis, blurred vision, and other diseases. neurological complications such as numbness in the feet, loss of sensation, bloating, indigestion, urination disorders...; Hyperthyroidism: occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone and releases it into the blood, causing symptoms and signs such as weight loss, fast heartbeat, irregular heartbeat, palpitations, tremors, increased sweating, sensitivity to hot temperatures, muscle weakness causing difficulty climbing stairs, rapid fatigue, loose stools, irritability...; Hypothyroidism: occurs when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone, causing symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, sluggishness, depression, swelling of the face and eyelids, sensitivity to cold temperatures, constipation, skin dryness, slow heart rate, cramps, menstrual disorders...; Cushing's syndrome: occurs when there is an excess of the hormone cortisol in the body. Cortisol plays a role in helping the body respond to physical or mental stress, regulating metabolism, and maintaining blood pressure. Excess cortisol can be due to endogenous causes, such as in the case of an adrenal adenoma that increases cortisol secretion, or due to exogenous causes, such as overuse of drugs containing corticosteroids. Symptoms of excess cortisol include weight gain, round face like the moon, fatty lumps on the back of the neck, shrunken limbs, muscle weakness, thin skin, easy bruising, slow wound healing, hair loss, and stretch marks. purplish redness in the abdomen and thighs, decreased sexual function...; Primary hyperaldosteronism: usually due to adrenal tumors or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, which increases aldosterone hormone secretion, causing hypertension and hypokalemia. Hypokalemia will cause symptoms such as muscle weakness, cramps, headaches, palpitations, increased drinking, frequent urination, and nocturia. Moderate-severe hypertension can be resistant to conventional treatment. Hyperaldosteronism is one of the causes of high blood pressure in young people that needs to be screened.; Pheochromocytomas: due to tumors originating from the adrenal medulla, increased secretion of catecholamines in the blood. Symptoms include high blood pressure, pale skin, sweating, palpitations, and headaches. There are also symptoms such as goosebumps, nausea, vomiting, hand tremors, fatigue, difficulty breathing, chest pain, and epigastric pain. This is also one of the causes of high blood pressure in young people.; Adrenal insufficiency: chronic adrenal insufficiency will have symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, dizziness due to postural hypotension, anxiety, abdominal pain, and slow physical development in children. In addition, primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) also has symptoms of increased skin pigmentation, especially on sun-exposed areas, skin folds, mucous membranes, scars, and areolas. A dangerous complication of adrenal insufficiency is acute adrenal insufficiency with symptoms such as severe muscle weakness, fainting, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, back pain, confusion, delirium, hypotension and possibly Can be fatal if not treated promptly.; Acromegaly: usually due to pituitary adenoma increasing growth hormone secretion, leading to abnormal development of bones, organs, and other tissues in the body. Common symptoms of acromegaly include large, coarse hands and feet, increasing in size compared to before, manifested through increased shoe, glove, and ring size. Facial features change, coarse face, longer vertical diameter, large nose, enlarged frontal bone, protruding lower jaw, raised eyebrows, sparse teeth, enlarged tongue, deep voice. Increased sweating, causing strong odor, increased sebum secretion. Acne, excess hair. Carpal tunnel syndrome, hand numbness, extremity paresthesia. Hypertrophy of cartilage and synovial tissue leads to hypertrophic arthritis leading to joint pain, back pain, and hunchback.; Prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma: hyperprolactinemia causes typical symptoms in premenopausal men and women, but not typical in postmenopausal women. Pre-menopausal women have symptoms such as infertility, oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, and galactorrhea (less common than the remaining symptoms). Men will have symptoms such as decreased sexual desire, infertility, impotence, gynecomastia, or galactorrhea (very rare), osteoporosis (if hypogonadism persists). For postmenopausal women, hyperprolactinemia is only recognized when the pituitary adenoma is large enough to cause headaches or vision loss, or the pituitary tumor is discovered incidentally on MRI. Symptoms of galactorrhea are rare in women. postmenopausal women. Children will have symptoms such as primary amenorrhea and delayed puberty.; Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): is a condition in which the ovaries produce abnormal amounts of androgens. Androgen is a male sex hormone, normally only present in very small amounts in women. Symptoms of PCOS include being overweight, obese, amenorrhea, irregular or sparse menstruation, infertility, hirsutism, sebaceous skin with acne, vaginal dryness, large or multiple ovaries. cysts, black thorn marks on the back of the neck, under the armpits, under the breasts...",
