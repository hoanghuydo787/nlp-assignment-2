    "subsection_content": "Symptoms of endocrine disorders can be discreet, difficult to recognize, progress silently over time and are non-specific, so clinical detection is often delayed after many months or even years. For this reason, performing blood tests to measure hormone levels of the peripheral endocrine glands and pituitary gland is necessary in detecting and diagnosing the disease.\nDiagnosis of endocrine disorders is a complex process that requires coordination of blood and urine tests, endocrine dynamic tests as well as imaging and genetic tests, because the endocrine system is the structure of the endocrine system. Structure has connectivity - regulating many different functions of the body such as growth, metabolism and reproduction.\nIf you have any symptoms of suspected endocrine disorders, you should see an endocrinologist to have tests performed based on symptoms and suspected endocrine diseases such as:\nUrine test.; Blood test quantifies hormone levels.; Fine needle aspiration biopsy; Imaging tests: ultrasound, computed tomography (CT scan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).; Genetic testing - genetics.\nIf the body has unusual symptoms, the patient should see an endocrinologist to find out the cause of endocrine disorders affecting health.",
