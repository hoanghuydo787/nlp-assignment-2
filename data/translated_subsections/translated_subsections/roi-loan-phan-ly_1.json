This is considered the most common manifestation of the recorded diseases. This disorder can occur suddenly or gradually and can last from minutes to years depending on the severity of the injury.; Depersonalization-derealization disorder: episodes of detachment from self or surroundings that may be experienced as “unreal” (lacking control or being “outside” the self) while still aware that this is just a feeling and not a reality.; The old category of unspecified dissociative disorder is now divided into two categories: other specified dissociative disorder and unspecified dissociative disorder.
