The reasons for these limitations are: (2)\nChildren have difficulty expressing their inner experiences; Parents may miss signals or try to hide abusive or neglectful behaviors; Signs may be subtle or transient; Children fall into a state of emotional disorders, memory and concentration related to dissociation that can be confused with other disorders.\nSigns of hidden stool disorders are difficult to detect, so they are easily overlooked\nTherefore, recognizing dissociative symptoms in children is considered a challenge.\nDissociative disorders often develop as a way of coping with trauma. Unpredictable or scary family environments can also cause a child to 'detach' from reality during times of stress. The severity of the disease in adulthood may be directly related to the severity of the childhood trauma.\nIn addition to developing diagnostic tests for children and adolescents, a number of approaches have been developed to improve the recognition and understanding of dissociation in children. Recent studies have focused on neurochemical, functional, and structural abnormalities of the brain (possibly resulting from childhood trauma) to clarify the neural basis of dissociation-related symptoms. .\nTraumatic events that occur during adulthood such as war, torture, or experiencing a natural disaster can also cause the disorder.
