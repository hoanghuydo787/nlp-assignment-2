The bulbs contain sensory neurons (ampullary organs).\n– Upper semicircular canal: located above the other 2 canals, has an upward arc, bulging bulb facing outward and flat end facing inward. – Horizontal semicircular canal: is the widest and shortest canal, has an outward arc and lies on the horizontal plane. – Posterior semicircular canal: is the narrowest but longest of the three canals, with an arc facing back, a bulging bulb facing down and a flat end facing up.\nTrue vestibular division:\nThis part consists of two main parts: the cyst (oval) and the spheroid (spherical). The follicle is located above close to the 5 holes communicating with the semicircular canals, the follicle is located below close to the basal spiral of the cochlea.\nAnatomical structure of the vestibular organ",
