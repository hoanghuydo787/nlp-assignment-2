    "subsection_content": "Usually, this is a common disease in the elderly. However, the disease is increasingly occurring in younger people, can occur at any age, and is more common in adults. If not treated early, the disease can cause complications that directly affect the patient's health and life. High-risk subjects include: (3)\n6.1. Elderly\nAs we often know, the elderly suffer from vestibular disorders at a fairly high rate, because people reach an age where their bodies begin to age, and some organs lose function.\nA recent epidemiological study in the US estimated that 35% of people aged 40 and over have experienced some vestibular disorder. People aged 65 years and older often suffer from dizziness, of which dizziness due to disorders in the vestibular system accounts for about 50%. Nearly 8 million American adults have a chronic disease. More dangerously, from the 70s onwards, more than half of accidental deaths in the elderly were due to problems related to falls due to dizziness and imbalance.\nIn Vietnam, this situation is similar, the number of people with the syndrome is increasing and getting younger.\n6.2. People working in stressful environments\nA high-pressure, often stressful work environment or unscientific living habits also pose high risks.\nStress causes the body to produce large amounts of the hormone cortisol, causing a series of diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc., causing damage to the nervous system, including the 8th nerve, which causes the vestibular system. receiving incorrect information and operating incorrectly, leading to disorder. Therefore, the incidence of the disease in office workers, intellectual workers... is increasing.\n6.3. Pregnant women\nPregnant women often suffer from morning sickness leading to loss of appetite, especially in the first 3 months, the body is not provided with enough nutrition, causing the pregnant woman to feel dizzy and light-headed. At the same time, physiological changes, anxiety, and fatigue also significantly affect the vestibular system, easily leading to vestibular disorder syndrome during pregnancy. Treatment during pregnancy must be as prescribed by a doctor to avoid side effects or dangerous complications.",
