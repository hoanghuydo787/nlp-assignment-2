    "subsection_content": "9.1 Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)\nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of dizziness caused by sudden changes in position, making you feel like yourself or things are spinning or swaying. The cause of this disease is small calcium crystals in the ear that are misplaced.\nThis syndrome can be improved through vestibular exercises guided by a doctor to help calcium crystals return to their original position.(5)\n9.2 Labyrinthitis of the ear\nLabyrinthitis is an inner ear infection that occurs when a delicate structure deep inside the ear becomes inflamed. This condition not only affects the body's balance and hearing control, but also causes symptoms such as ear pain, tinnitus, ear discharge, nausea and high fever...\n9.3 Vestibular neuritis\nVestibular neuritis is the cause of sudden dizziness accompanied by nausea, vomiting and loss of balance. The most commonly thought cause may be caused by a virus and affects the vestibular nerve - the part that transmits sound information and regulates balance from the inner ear to the brain.\n9.4 Meniere's disease\nMénière's disease is an inner ear disorder that causes dizziness, tinnitus, and hearing loss. The cause of this disease may be due to an increase in the amount of fluid in the ear, a virus, an allergy or an autoimmune reaction of the body. In some cases, the disease can make hearing loss worse and can become permanent.\nChanging your diet such as eating less salt, reducing salt, coffee, and alcohol can reduce symptoms caused by Ménière's disease. For severe cases, surgical intervention is required to relieve symptoms of the disease, but people with this disease very rarely need surgery.\n9.5 Perilymph fistula (PLF)\nPerilymph fistula in the inner ear is when a hole or defect appears in the area separating the middle ear and inner ear membrane, causing dizziness or worse, hearing loss. Perilymph fistula can be caused by birth, head trauma or heavy lifting. When you have this disease, you need surgical intervention to fill the hole or tear in your ear.\n9.6 Some other causes of vestibular disorders\nAcoustic neuroma\nAcoustic neuroma or 8th nerve tumor is a benign, non-cancerous and slow-growing tumor. However, it can compress the auditory nerve and cause imbalance in the body, leading to hearing loss, tinnitus and dizziness. In some cases, this tumor can press on the facial nerve, leading to sharp pain or facial paralysis. Acoustic nerve tumors can be removed surgically or treated with radiation to inhibit growth.\nEar poisoning\nOtotoxicity is a condition in which the inner ear is seriously affected, especially behind the cochlea and auditory nerve cells when using drugs or chemicals to treat diseases, causing functional impairment or even hearing loss. . This condition may improve when the patient stops using drugs or chemicals.\nExpanded vestibular aqueduct (EVA)\nThe vestibular aqueduct is a small bony canal that extends from the internal space of the inner ear to the brain. When the vestibular aqueduct is wider than normal, the patient is likely to experience hearing loss. In fact, the specific cause of this disease has not been found, but many believe that genetics is one of the factors that cause the vestibular aqueduct to widen.\nCurrently, there is no treatment for people with this disease. However, early diagnosis and avoiding head injuries are the best ways to protect your hearing.\nMigraine headache\nMigraine headache is a condition of severe headaches, lasting a few hours to 3 days, which may be accompanied by dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, hearing loss and tinnitus, and some people also have blurred vision. . This pathology often appears in people with a history of migraines. Vestibular disorders can occur in people with migraine but do not have headaches.",
