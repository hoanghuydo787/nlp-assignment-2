Accordingly, medical experts have divided into two main categories:\nOrganic digestive disease (occurs when structural abnormalities appear in the digestive system, leading to affected activities).; Organic digestive disease (occurs when the digestive system has structural abnormalities, leading to affected activities).\nFunctional digestive disorders (Occurs when the digestive system does not function normally but there is no physical disease).; Functional digestive disorders (Occurs when the digestive system does not function normally but there is no physical disease).\nThe condition appears with diverse symptoms, affecting many parts of the system at the same time. Specifically, digestion is the process of breaking down and converting food into nutrients, passing through the intestinal wall and into the blood. It all starts in the mouth area, when chewing, food mixed with saliva is then decomposed and crushed by stomach contractions. When it reaches the intestines, digestive juices from the gallbladder and pancreas will continue to decompose again. At this time, nutrients pass through the intestinal wall and into the blood, serving the purpose of energy production. Meanwhile, unabsorbed food will combine with dead cells to convert into feces in the colon.(3)\nThis is a normal digestive process. If a disorder occurs, one or more stages will be affected, causing common unpleasant symptoms.",
