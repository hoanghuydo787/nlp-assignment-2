Among them, two typical situations include:\nGastroesophageal reflux disease: The esophagus is connected to the mouth and stomach. Reflux occurs when gastric secretions travel back up into this area, causing pain and discomfort. If the disease is not treated early, in the long term it will lead to damage to the esophagus.; Gastroesophageal reflux disease: The esophagus is connected to the mouth and stomach.
