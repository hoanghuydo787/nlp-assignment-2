    "subsection_content": "Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that 8 common causes of menorrhagia in middle age are: (2)\n1. Age factor\nWhen entering premenopause, ovarian function will decline, and a lack of the hormone Estrogen can cause hormonal imbalance. From there, the ovaries cannot release eggs, the corpus luteum is weak or absent, which will prolong the number of menstruation days and increase the amount of menstrual bleeding.\n2. Unhealthy living habits\nPeople who regularly abuse alcohol, beer, stimulants such as coffee, cigarettes... or abuse antibiotics for a long time may enter menopause earlier than normal, easily causing menorrhagia.\nOr people with unscientific diets and excessive abstinence cause the body to lack nutrients, leading to disturbances in the synthesis of the necessary estrogen hormone, directly affecting the menstrual cycle.\n3. Change in emotions\nWomen entering premenopause are prone to stress, hot flashes, and excessive worry, leading to prolonged stress. These symptoms can cause sudden amenorrhea or menorrhagia. In some cases, you may also have severe abdominal pain during menstruation.\nEmotional changes can make menorrhagia symptoms worse\n4. Uterine fibroids\nUterine fibroids are benign tumors that appear in the uterus, commonly found in women between the ages of 30 and 50. The disease can cause prolonged menorrhagia in premenopausal women.\n5. Uterine polyps\nUterine polyps are tumors that stick to the inner wall of the uterus due to excessive growth of cells in the endometrium. And one of the common symptoms of the disease is prolonged menorrhagia.\n6. Having other gynecological diseases\nWomen with other gynecological diseases in the endometrium, cervix, ovaries or gynecological infections during this period are at higher risk of menorrhagia.\n7. Suffering from cancer\nSome cancers such as cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer... can cause women to experience menorrhagia or abnormal vaginal bleeding. Therefore, when encountering this condition, women need to immediately go to the hospital for early examination to rule out cases of menorrhagia due to dangerous cancer.\n8. Other causes\nSide effects of using an IUD, having a hereditary coagulation disorder syndrome or using medication to treat other diseases also cause premenopausal women to have higher menorrhagia than usual.\nYou need to inform your doctor about the medications you are taking to accurately diagnose the cause of menorrhagia",
