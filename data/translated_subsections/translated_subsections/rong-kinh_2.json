    "subsection_content": "Menorrhagia can be due to many reasons, from hormone-related problems, other medical conditions or sometimes stress. Below are the most common causes: (3)\n1. Hormone imbalance\nThe balance between the hormones Estrogen and Progesterone in women will help regulate the accumulation of uterine lining that sheds during the menstrual cycle. If there is a hormone deficiency that causes an imbalance, the uterine lining will overgrow, leading to heavy menstrual bleeding.\nCauses that can disrupt hormone balance in women include polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid disease, obesity, insulin resistance...\n2. Ovarian dysfunction\nIf eggs are not released during the menstrual cycle, the female body cannot produce the hormone Progesterone as in a normal menstrual cycle, causing hormone imbalance, resulting in menorrhagia.\n3. Uterine fibroids\nBenign uterine fibroids are also one of the reasons why menstrual cycles last longer than normal.\n4. Endometriosis\nEndometriosis in the uterine muscle can cause pain and bleeding, causing the patient to see more blood flow in and out of the cycle.\n5. Uterine polyps\nBenign, small polyps located on the uterine lining can cause prolonged bleeding.\n6. Insert an IUD\nMenorrhagia is also one of the common side effects of IUD insertion to prevent pregnancy.\n7. Related to pregnancy\nMiscarriage (death of the fetus in the uterus) or ectopic pregnancy can cause abnormal bleeding.\nEctopic pregnancy is one of the causes of prolonged menstrual bleeding\n8. Using medicine\nSome medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs, anticoagulants, hormonal drugs... can cause prolonged menstrual bleeding.\n9. Other diseases\nInherited blood clotting disorders such as Von Willebrand disease can cause abnormal menstrual bleeding. In addition, cervical cancer, uterine cancer or ovarian cancer can also lead to menorrhagia.\n10. Other risk factors\nDuring a normal menstrual cycle, the ovaries release eggs (ovulation) to produce the hormone Progesterone for the body, keeping the menstrual cycle regular. If the egg is not released, the amount of Progesterone hormone can cause heavy bleeding.\nMenorrhagia in adolescents is due to disorders of the ovulation process. For teenage girls, usually the first year eggs cannot be released from the ovaries.\nFor women of reproductive age, this phenomenon is related to diseases such as uterine fibroids, uterine polyps or endometriosis. In addition, other diseases such as uterine cancer, hereditary blood clotting disorders, liver and kidney diseases or side effects of medications can also cause this condition.\nIn addition, premenopausal menorrhagia is also one of the common conditions in middle-aged women.",
