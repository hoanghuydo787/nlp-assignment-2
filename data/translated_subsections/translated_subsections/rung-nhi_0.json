    "subsection_content": "Atrial fibrillation or atrial fibrillation is one of the common heart rhythm disorders, especially in elderly patients (usually over 60 years old). In atrial fibrillation, the patient's heart beat is irregular and chaotic even when resting - said Dr. Vu Tran Dinh Huy, Heart Center of Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City.\nDiseases can be divided into 4 types, including: (2)\nParoxysmal atrial fibrillation: This is a type of atrial fibrillation that begins and ends suddenly. Atrial fibrillation can last as short as a few minutes, or it can last for hours or days. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation can end on its own without medical intervention. During atrial fibrillation, patients often have symptoms of palpitations, fatigue, and shortness of breath. The longer atrial fibrillation lasts, the higher the risk of stroke complications; Persistent atrial fibrillation: A type of atrial fibrillation that lasts more than a week. In order for the heart to return to normal rhythm, the patient needs to use special medications or special intervention methods such as \"electric shock cardioversion\".; Persistent atrial fibrillation: Atrial fibrillation that lasts more than 12 months; Permanent atrial fibrillation: A condition in which the heart cannot return to a normal rhythm. Attempts to return the patient to a normal heart rate are largely ineffective and the patient will depend entirely on medication to partially control the symptoms of the disease.\nIn some patients, this condition may appear and then stop on its own, so it is called paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. However, the disease can progress, persist and continuously become persistent atrial fibrillation.",
