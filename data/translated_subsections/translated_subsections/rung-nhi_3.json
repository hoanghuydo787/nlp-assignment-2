    "subsection_content": "To diagnose and detect atrial fibrillation, the doctor will examine the patient's medical history, symptoms of suspected atrial fibrillation, and medical history of the patient and family. Next, the patient will have a cardiovascular examination to support the diagnosis. Doctors may also order patients to undergo a number of additional tests, including: (4)\nRoutine electrocardiogram (ECG): This is the most basic diagnostic used to diagnose atrial fibrillation. ECG is a machine that records heart rhythm through electrodes glued/attached to the patient's body. However, ECG only records heart rate for a short period of time, so it can miss the disease if the patient is \"out of an attack\" of atrial fibrillation.; Holter ECG: Is an electrocardiogram recording device that is more compact and can be worn conveniently. In cases where the patient has symptoms suspected of atrial fibrillation, but the attacks are short, infrequent and difficult to detect when measuring ECG, the doctor may prescribe Holter ECG measurement to continuously record heart rhythm within a period of time. 24 hours or multiple days. Monitoring and recording heart rate for one/many days will help increase the ability to \"catch\" atrial fibrillation, contributing to the accurate diagnosis of the medical condition.; Heart rate event recorder: A portable heart rate recording device with the ability to monitor heart rate from weeks to months. However, the machine does not automatically record ECG continuously like Holter ECG. When the patient feels symptoms of arrhythmia such as nervousness, shortness of breath, fast heartbeat, palpitations, weakness, etc., the patient will press a button on the machine. The device will save your heart rate before and after you press the button for a few minutes. Your doctor will review your heart rhythm while you have symptoms to determine what rhythm it is, helping to detect atrial fibrillation if present.",
