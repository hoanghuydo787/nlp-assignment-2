    "subsection_content": "In patients with atrial fibrillation, the two top chambers of the heart (called the atria) contract very quickly and chaotically and irregularly. This leads to blood stagnation in the atria, creating conditions for blood clots to form in the heart. These blood clots can then be pumped out by the heart, traveling through blood vessels to the brain or other organs, causing a stroke or acute blood vessel blockage in other parts of the body. Patients with atrial fibrillation have a 5-7 times higher risk of stroke than other patients.\nIn atrial fibrillation, the heart beats irregularly, often beating rapidly continuously, causing the heart to contract poorly, weaken and reduce the effectiveness of pumping blood to the body. On the other hand, if this condition persists over time, it will increase the risk of heart failure, while also aggravating other cardiovascular diseases, and most dangerously, it can cause death.",
