    "subsection_content": "Hair loss has many causes, including: (3)\n1. Hormonal changes\nPregnant women, during menopause or after giving birth, the hormones at these stages change suddenly, causing hair to thin due to hair follicles shrinking, causing hair to grow slowly and break more easily.\n2. Stress, tension, depression\nWhen in a state of stress, the body will produce free radicals that damage hair follicles, causing this part to rest prematurely, affecting the speed of hair growth, and even causing hair to fall out.\n3. Genetics\nHair loss can be hereditary. If someone in the family has hair loss leading to baldness, there is a high possibility that children will also encounter the same situation.\n4. Side effects of the drug\nDrugs used to dissolve blood clots, treat acne rich in vitamin A, anabolic steroids, treat arthritis, gout, depression drugs, treat heart disease or high blood pressure, drugs used in cancer chemotherapy... can cause hair loss. However, when you stop using these drugs, your hair will quickly grow back.\n5. Scalp fungus\nThe disease mainly occurs in children. The disease causes hair loss, but if properly examined and treated, hair will grow back quickly.\n6. Pull or apply strong force to the hair\nOccurs due to Trichotillomania addiction syndrome. Trichotillomania can lead to infections, skin damage and permanent hair loss. In extreme cases, some people avoid communication to hide their addiction to hair pulling.\n7. Polluted environment\nPolluted air, high humidity, and frequent exposure to sunlight cause dry scalp and frizzy hair that easily breaks.\n8. Wrong hair care\nDyeing, perming or straightening your hair can thin your hair. Over time, hair will break and fall out.\n9. Imbalanced nutrition\nIf the diet lacks iron, biotin or protein, the hair follicles are not provided with enough nutrients to nourish the hair, causing the hair to become dry, weak and prone to breakage.\n10. Chemicals\nOveruse of styling products such as perms and bleaches can cause damage, tangles, and hair loss.\n11. Poisoning\nArsenic, thallium, mercury and lithium. If a large amount of warfarin (a substance found in rat poison) is swallowed, it can also cause hair loss.\n12. Effects of chronic disease\nDiabetes, lupus, thyroid, scalp psoriasis, etc. Specifically, when you have diabetes, your blood vessels are easily damaged due to increased sugar levels. At this time, the amount of oxygen reaching the hair follicles is inhibited, inhibiting the growth of hair follicles, causing hair to break and fall out.\n13. Treatment methods\nChemotherapy or radiation therapy to the head and neck can cause total hair loss. Hair loss occurs as a secondary consequence of the use of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The degree of hair loss will vary depending on the medication being used, dosage and frequency of treatment. While some patients experience only mild hair loss, others may experience more severe hair loss.\n14. Age\nThe aging process causes many changes in the body's metabolic activity and a weakened immune system, making hair weak, prone to breakage and discoloration. Therefore, in middle age, gray hair begins to appear, hair falls out more, and becomes thinner than when young.\n15. Sexually transmitted infections\nSyphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases can cause hair loss in patches on the scalp, eyebrows, and beard.",
