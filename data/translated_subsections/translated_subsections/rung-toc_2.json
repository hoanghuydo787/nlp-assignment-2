    "subsection_content": "1. Gradually thin on the top of the head\nThis is a common type of hair loss, common in older people. In men, hair begins to fall out from the hair above the forehead. For women, hair loss is often seen when the hairline recedes (or anterior fibrotic alopecia).\n2. Circular or patchy bald spots\nIn some cases, hair falls out in circular or patchy spots on the scalp. Before that, the skin may be itchy or painful before hair loss.\n3. Sudden hair loss\nPeople suffering from certain physical or mental shocks, psychological tension, and stress can cause hair to fall out suddenly and become brittle. A tuft of hair can fall out when combing, washing your hair, or even just pulling lightly. This condition often causes hair thinning but is only temporary.\n4. Hair loss all over the body\nTotal hair loss occurs while being treated with certain methods, such as chemotherapy.\n5. Scaly patches spread on the scalp\nScaly patches spreading on the scalp can be a sign of infection (bacteria, fungus, etc.). This condition causes hair loss along with redness, swelling and oozing.",
