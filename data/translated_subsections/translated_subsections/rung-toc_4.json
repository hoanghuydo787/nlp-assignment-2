    "subsection_content": "Physiological hair loss and pathological hair loss are two completely different conditions and are distinguished by the following factors:\n1. Physiological hair loss\nPhysiological hair loss (life-cycle hair loss) is a condition in which hair grows and lengthens and gradually falls out over time. After hair falls out, a new layer of hair will grow to replace the old hair. On average, 30 - 100 hairs fall out every day and an equivalent amount of new hair grows. This is a normal physiological phenomenon and is nothing to worry about.\n2. Pathological hair loss\nWhen hair falls out more than 100 strands per day, the cause is unknown and it falls continuously over a long period of time. In some cases, hair loss is accompanied by itching, peeling skin, and many red spots. These may be signs of dermatological diseases leading to hair loss. Factors that cause hair to break easily include: neuroendocrine disorders, genetics, stress, nutritional imbalance, and inflammation.",
