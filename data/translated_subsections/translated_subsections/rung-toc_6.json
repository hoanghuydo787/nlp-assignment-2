    "subsection_content": "In some cases, hair loss can be permanent, while in others it is temporary. Common types of hair loss:\n1. Hair loss without cause\nThis is a condition in which hair falls out and thins with age. Hair follicles enter the resting phase. Therefore, the hair will be shorter and less.\n2. Hair loss in men\nHair loss in men is often related to genes and male sex hormones. Accordingly, the hairline gradually moves backwards to form an M shape. A circular area at the back of the head (top) thins and expands in size over time. Finally, the hair becomes smooth, shorter, and thinner, while creating a U-shaped (or horseshoe) style around the sides of the head. (5)\n3. Hair loss in women\nAny girl or woman can experience hair loss. However, hair loss in women is often common in the following subjects:\nWomen over 40 years old.; Postpartum women; Patients using chemotherapy or affected by other drugs; People who often wear their hair in ponytails, tight braids, or use harsh chemicals to style their hair.; Women in menopause.\n4. Hair loss in patches (patchy)\nAlopecia areata is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks hair follicles. This causes hair to fall out in patches that are roughly the size and shape of a coin. The likelihood of alopecia areata is higher if a relative has this disease. In addition, alopecia areata is more common in people with family members suffering from autoimmune disorders such as diabetes, lupus or thyroid.\n5. Hair loss all over the body\nGeneralized hair loss is often seen in patients who are using chemotherapy to treat cancer.\n6. Trichotillomania\nTrichotillomania (or trichotillomania) is a mental disorder that involves repetitive urges to pull out hair, eyebrows, or hair from other areas of the body. Pulling hair often leaves patchy bald spots, causing discomfort for the patient and hindering communication and work activities.\nFor people with hair pulling addiction, this behavior may stem from:\nStress: deliberately pulling out hair to relieve stress; Voluntarily: pulling out your hair without realizing you're doing it, for example when you're bored.\n7. Telogen effluvium\nTelogen effluvium causes temporary hair loss that occurs due to stress or changes to the body. Acute telogen effluvium lasts less than 6 months, hair loss occurs 2-3 months after the body falls into a state of stress.\nChronic telogen effluvium lasts more than 6 months, the disease affects the entire scalp and has no obvious cause. Hair may fall out in patches in the early stages of chronic telogen effluvium. However, this condition does not cause complete baldness.\n8. Anagen effluvium\nAnagen effluvium is a condition of very rapid hair loss, occurring due to causes such as chemotherapy, infection, toxins, radiation or autoimmune diseases.\n9. Scarring alopecia leads to permanent hair loss\nScarring alopecia (alopecia areata) occurs when hair follicles are destroyed, often due to infection, chemical exposure, burns or autoimmune disorders. This condition can leave permanent scarring because hair cannot grow without healthy hair follicles. Scarring hair loss causes emotional and psychological effects, causing patients to have low self-esteem and guilt.\nThere are 2 types of scarring alopecia:\nPrimary scarring alopecia: inflammatory or autoimmune disorder that directly destroys hair follicles.; Secondary scarring hair loss: occurs due to complications of trauma or from damage to the skin.\nHair loss can occur at any age.",
