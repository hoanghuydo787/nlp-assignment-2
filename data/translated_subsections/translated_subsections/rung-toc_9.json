    "subsection_content": "There are many causes of hair loss, the doctor will base on each specific case to provide appropriate hair loss treatment:\n1. Treatment with medication\nUse a topical medication on the scalp, such as Minoxidil or Rogaine速. These two drugs are often used in the first treatment for thinning hair. Additionally, patients can use the prescription oral medications Finasteride or Propecia速 (for men with baldness).\n2. Use natural methods\nTreat hair loss with grapefruit peel: essential oil from grapefruit peel stimulates growth, nourishes each hair follicle, helping hair grow long, beautiful and naturally strong. By cutting up the grapefruit peel, put it in a pot of boiling water, let it cool, then use that water to wash your hair.\nBesides, hair loss can be treated with coconut oil: this is an ingredient often found in shampoos or conditioners. With its moisturizing properties, coconut oil helps smooth hair, prevents tangles, and prevents breakage.\nUse aloe vera to improve hair loss: aloe vera contains vitamins A, C and E. All three vitamins contribute to cell regeneration, promote growth and make hair shiny. Vitamin B12 and folic acid found in aloe vera also help reduce hair loss, soothe itchy scalp, and treat seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff).\n3. Use hair transplant and laser methods\nDuring the hair transplant process, the doctor will remove hair from areas with thick hair. Then, those hairs will be transplanted into places with sparse or little hair.\nAdditionally, low-level laser therapy (or red light therapy, cold laser therapy) is used to treat hair loss, by irradiating photons into the scalp tissues. These photons are absorbed by cells to stimulate hair growth. Laser therapy is gradually becoming widely accepted because it is safe and less invasive than hair transplantation.\n4. Use products to help treat hair loss and stimulate hair growth\nUsing platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to help treat hair loss, by drawing blood and separating the plasma. The doctor will then inject platelet-rich plasma into the scalp. PRP treatment helps slow hair loss and encourages new hair growth. In addition, hair loss treatment methods can be mentioned such as PRP needle rolling and HA injections.\nDr. CKI Vo Thi Tuong Duy is injecting HA to treat hair loss and stimulate hair regrowth.",
