    "subsection_content": "Dementia is caused by damage or loss of nerve cells and nerve cell connections in the brain. Depending on the area of ​​the brain damaged, the effects of dementia can manifest and vary in severity in each person. Dementia is often grouped according to common features of the disease, such as protein or protein deposits in the brain or affected part of the brain... and divided into two types.\n1. Dementia (irreversible - due to degenerative causes)\nAlso known as progressive dementia. Progressive dementia is divided into many types, each type corresponding to each cause and specific symptoms as follows:\nAlzheimer's disease: is the most common cause of dementia. Patients with Alzheimer's have Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tufts in the brain. Plaques are clumps of protein called beta-amyloid. These blocks damage healthy nerve cells and the fibers that connect them.; Vascular dementia: This is the second most common type of dementia caused by damage to the vessels that supply blood to the brain. Blood vessel problems can cause strokes or damage the brain in other ways, such as damaging fibers in the brain's white matter. The most common symptoms of vascular dementia include difficulty solving problems and slowing thinking, concentration and organization. These tend to be more noticeable than symptoms of dementia.; Lewy body dementia: Ball-like lumps of abnormal protein that form in the brain cause dementia. This type of progressive dementia is also very common. Common signs and symptoms of Lewy bodies include: Sleepwalking, hallucinations, problems with concentration and attention, uncoordinated or slow movements, tremors and stiffness.; Frontal dementia: This is a group of diseases characterized by the breakdown (degeneration) of nerve cells or by the connection of nerve cells in the frontal and temporal lobes. Common symptoms of the disease include instability in behavior, personality, thinking, judgment, language and movement.; Mixed dementia: Caused by multiple diseases at the same time in the elderly such as Alzheimer's disease along with vascular dementia.; Huntington's disease: Gene mutation causes some nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord to be eliminated. Signs and symptoms of this disease include a severe decline in thinking (cognitive) skills, which usually appears between the ages of 30 and 40; Traumatic brain injury (TBI): This condition is often caused by repeated head trauma. People such as boxers, football players or soldiers are at higher risk of traumatic brain injury. Depending on the part of the brain injured, this condition can cause signs and symptoms of dementia such as depression, agitation, memory loss and impaired speech. TBI can also cause parkinsonism. Symptoms of the disease may not appear immediately after the injury but may not appear until many years later.; Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (also known as mad cow disease): This is a rare brain disorder that usually occurs in people without risk factors for dementia. The disease can be caused by deposits of infectious proteins called prions, but it can also be genetic. Transplanting a cornea from a person with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease to a healthy person can transmit this disease.; Parkinson's disease: Many people with Parkinson's disease eventually develop symptoms of dementia (dementia Parkinson's disease).\nAlzheimer's disease is a major cause of dementia\n2. Dementia is not caused by degeneration of the nervous system\nSome causes of reversible dementia with corresponding symptoms include:\nInfections and immune disorders: Dementia-like symptoms may be caused by fever or other side effects of the body's response to infection. Multiple sclerosis and other conditions where the body's immune system attacks nerve cells can also cause dementia.; Metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities: People with thyroid problems, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), too little or too much sodium or calcium, or problems with absorption vitamin B12 may develop dementia-like symptoms or other personality changes.; Nutritional deficiencies: Dehydration; Vitamin B1, B6, B12, vitamin E, copper deficiencies in the diet can cause dementia-like symptoms; Medication side effects: Medication side effects, reactions to medications, or interactions of certain medications can cause dementia-like symptoms.; Subdural hematoma: Bleeding between the surface of the brain and its covering, common in the elderly after a fall, can cause symptoms similar to those of dementia.; Poisoning: Exposure to heavy metals such as lead, pesticides, heavy alcohol consumption, and stimulant use can lead to symptoms of dementia.; Brain tumor: Brain tumors can damage the nerves leading to dementia.; Hypoxia: When organ tissues do not receive enough oxygen such as severe sleep apnea, asthma, heart attack, carbon monoxide poisoning... it can lead to dementia.; Normal hydrocephalus: This condition is caused by enlarged ventricles in the brain, which can cause problems with walking, difficulty urinating, and dementia.",
