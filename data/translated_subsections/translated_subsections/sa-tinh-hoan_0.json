    "subsection_content": "Testicular prolapse (dropping testicles) is a condition in which the size of the scrotum hanging from the testicles will be longer than the penis in its normal state. When a man sits, the scrotal skin cannot contract around the testicles as it normally does. The cause is that the scrotum stretches, causing the testicles to sag. (first)\nTesticles are an important part of male physiology. The endocrine function of the testicles is to regulate the hormone testosterone. The exocrine function of the testicles is to produce sperm. The testicles have two sides, connected and surrounded by the scrotum.\nIn adults, testicles are 4 - 4.5cm long and 2 - 2.5cm wide. In the natural state, the length of the testicles will be greater or equal to the penis when not erect.",
