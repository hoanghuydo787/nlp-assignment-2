    "subsection_content": "Testicular prolapse has many negative impacts on men's mental health. Some causes of testicular prolapse include:\nOrchitis: The disease is characterized by high fever, uncomfortable pain, swelling in the testicles, making the testicles larger than normal, stretching the scrotum, leading to sagging. Orchitis, if there is no early intervention, can cause complications such as infection spreading to other areas such as prostatitis, nephritis...; Testicular torsion and varicocele: This is a condition in which the veins of the testicles become twisted or stretched. These diseases cause varicose veins in the testicles, causing blood to not circulate evenly, causing the testicles to increase in size, leading to testicular prolapse.; The scrotal skin is wider than the seminal vesicles: The scrotal skin is larger and does not hug the testicles tightly. The condition can cause unilateral or bilateral testicular prolapse; High temperature: The scrotum can contract or expand according to temperature. This is to maintain a stable internal environment for the testicles to develop. Warmer temperatures due to weather or exercise can cause the scrotal skin to stretch excessively.; Testicle size: Testicle size that is too large, exceeding the scrotum's ability to contract is also one of the causes of testicular sagging.; Hydrocele in the spermatic cord: When the spermatic suction tube is dysfunctional, it can cause hydrocele, causing the seminal vesicles to prolapse, leading to testicular sagging.; Cancer in the testicles: This is the most dangerous and serious disease in people with testicular prolapse. When cancer cells develop, they will create lymph nodes in the testicles, leading to increased testicular volume and size. At this time, the scrotum is under great pressure, making the sagging condition even more serious.; Inguinal hernia: This is an indirect cause of testicular prolapse. Inguinal hernia causes testicles to sag, causing pain in the scrotum, especially when walking and standing.; Damage to the testicular lining.",
