This condition deforms the testicles, causing pain to the patient. Twisted veins will cause poor blood circulation. In addition, when veins dilate too much, they can affect the genital organs. Patients often have testicular pain and have many difficulties in their sexual life; There may even be paralysis, premature ejaculation, decreased sperm quality...; Venous effusion: This is a condition in which the amount of fluid in the veins is stagnant, concentrated on only one side of the scrotal sac, causing the testicles to swell, become abnormally large, causing sagging; Damage to the testicular membrane: When damaged, the testicular membrane can cause blood to stagnate in the testicles, more seriously, pus. When not detected and treated early, men can suffer from orchitis and sagging sperm.; Wide scrotal skin: In normal men, the genital structure will have scrotal skin of sufficient size to hug the testicles. However, some men have the scrotal skin wider than the seminal vesicles, which leads to sagging testicles.; Testicular cancer: This disease can cause a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum.
