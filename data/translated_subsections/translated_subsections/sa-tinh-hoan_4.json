    "subsection_content": "Testicular prolapse can be a warning sign of certain diseases in men such as: (2)\n1. Orchitis\nThe disease usually appears in men over 30 years old. At that time, the testicles are invaded by harmful bacteria and cause infection. These bacteria often originate from the urethra and then travel upward through the vas deferens, causing infection in the testicles.\nCommon symptoms in patients with orchitis include testicular prolapse; bloody semen; pain when urinating, ejaculating, and having sex; Feeling heavy and stuck in the groin. Patients often experience fatigue and weakness, which may be accompanied by high fever. Serious cases may cause swelling, edema, and fluid accumulation in the testicles.\n2. Epididymitis\nThis is a condition in which the epididymis is swollen and inflamed due to infection or not. If treatment is delayed, men may experience infertility, impaired physiological function, and even impotence. Some cases of epididymitis can lead to other diseases such as prostatitis and urinary tract infections.\nPatients with epididymitis often have symptoms such as a warm, red, swollen scrotum; pain in one testicle (especially when urinating, ejaculating, and having sex); Pelvic or lower abdominal discomfort. Some accompanying symptoms may appear such as fluid and pus discharge from the penis, semen mixed with blood. Patients may experience fatigue, chills and high fever.\n3. Testicular torsion\nTesticular torsion is a condition in which the testicle twists at the end of the spermatic cord, causing loss of blood supply to the testicle, causing testicular damage, even necrosis. This disease is rare, usually due to trauma or unknown causes. Testicular torsion causes blood flow to the testicles to stop, leading to tissue damage, causing testicular prolapse.",
