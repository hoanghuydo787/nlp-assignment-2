However, over time, the tumor/tissue may prolapse outside the anus permanently and cannot be pushed back inside.\nLong-term rectal prolapse will occur more often when the patient coughs, sneezes or stands up. Sometimes, rectal prolapse may feel like “sitting on a ball” or like incomplete bowel movements.\nIn addition, rectal prolapse can also have other symptoms such as difficulty controlling bowel movements, bright red blood flowing from the rectum, discomfort and possibly constipation.
