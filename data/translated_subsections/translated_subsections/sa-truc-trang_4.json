During a physical examination, the doctor will insert a gloved finger and lubricant into the rectum to examine. Besides, the doctor may also ask the patient to sit on the toilet to defecate. This will help the doctor see the prolapse.\nDoctor Hau said that at Tam Anh Hospital there is a video recording system when patients are defecating, including a specialized camera installed on the toilet and a remote control computer system to diagnose rectal prolapse. exactly 100%.\nSpecialized camera installed on toilet seat\nIn addition, patients may also be asked to do some other, more advanced tests to diagnose rectal prolapse, especially for people with medical conditions. Tests include:\nX-ray: An X-ray will show the rectum and anal canal while the patient defecates.; X-ray: An X-ray will show the rectum and anal canal while the patient defecates.\nColonoscopy: A long tube is inserted into the rectum with a small camera on the end to look for any problems that could be causing prolapse; Colonoscopy: A long tube is inserted into the rectum with a small camera on the end to look for any problems that could cause prolapse.\nEndometrial ultrasound: A probe is inserted into the anus and rectum to examine the muscles and tissues.; Endometrial ultrasound: A probe is inserted into the anus and rectum to examine muscles and tissues.\nSigmoidoscopy: Uses a long tube with a camera on the end to go deep into the intestines to look for inflammation, scarring or tumors.; Sigmoidoscopy: Uses a long tube with a camera on the end to go deep into the intestines to look for inflammation, scarring or tumors.\nMRI: Takes images to examine all organs in the patient's pelvic region.; MRI: Takes images to examine all organs in the patient's pelvic region.\nAnal manometry: A thin tube is inserted into the rectum to test muscle strength; Anal manometry: A thin tube is inserted into the rectum to test muscle strength.\nAnal electromyography (EMG): This method helps check whether nerve damage is causing problems with the anal sphincter.; Anal electromyography (EMG): This method helps check whether nerve damage is causing problems with the anal sphincter.\nDorsal nerve terminal motor latency test: This method helps test the dorsal nerve that plays a role in controlling intestinal motility.; Dorsal nerve terminal motor latency test: This method helps test the dorsal nerve, which plays a role in controlling intestinal motility.",
