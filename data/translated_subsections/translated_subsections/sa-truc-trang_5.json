    "subsection_content": "Rectal prolapse can be treated with one of the following methods:\n1. Treatment with medication\nIf rectal prolapse is mild, the patient can be treated with stool softeners and fiber supplements as prescribed by the doctor. Medications to treat rectal prolapse will soften stools to help patients defecate more easily. However, drug treatment is only a temporary solution and cannot cure rectal prolapse, so doctors advise patients to have rectal prolapse surgery as soon as possible.\n2. Physical therapy treatment\nSupportive physical therapy before and after rectal prolapse surgery is a unique feature of the Anorectal Unit at Tam Anh Hospital. Physical therapy aims to strengthen the anal and pelvic floor muscles and restore defecation reflexes. The patient will receive electrical stimulation in the anus combined with biofeedback and Kegel exercises.\n3. Surgical treatment\nThe most common treatment for rectal prolapse is surgery to put the rectum back in place. The type of surgery a patient is offered will depend on factors such as overall health, age, and the severity of the rectal prolapse. There are currently two most common types of surgery commonly applied to patients with rectal prolapse including:\nAbdominal surgery: Doctors can operate using traditional surgery or laparoscopic surgery to suspend the prolapsed rectum into the sacred bone.; Abdominal surgery: Doctors can operate using traditional surgery or laparoscopic surgery to suspend the prolapsed rectum into the sacred bone.\nPerineal surgery: Altemeier surgery: cutting the rectum through the anus - connecting the rectum and anal canal. Perineal surgery aims to affect the inner lining of the rectum or the part of the rectum that has prolapsed outside the anus to return them to their original state.; Perineal surgery: Altemeier surgery: cutting the rectum through the anus - connecting the rectum and anal canal.
