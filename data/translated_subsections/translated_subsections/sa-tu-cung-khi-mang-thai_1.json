However, according to experts, among the causes, having many children may be the main risk factor. (2)\nWomen with a history of pelvic floor trauma or congenital pelvic floor dysfunction are at risk of developing this condition. Uterine prolapse that develops during pregnancy is most likely due to the development of physiological changes during pregnancy that lead to weakening of the supporting structures of the pelvic organs. Pregnancy itself can cause prolapse. Increased cortisol and progesterone levels during pregnancy may contribute to relaxation of the uterine suspensory ligaments. Damage to the genitals due to multiple pregnancies and labor are factors that easily lead to uterine prolapse.\nOther factors may include prolonged labor or difficult birth, a long or enlarged cervix, which will be heavier than a normal cervix, pulling the uterus down. Some common risk factors include age, obesity, congenitally weak pelvic floor muscle support system, increased abdominal pressure, pelvic tumors, pelvic trauma... Rarely does this condition occur in people have never been pregnant.",
