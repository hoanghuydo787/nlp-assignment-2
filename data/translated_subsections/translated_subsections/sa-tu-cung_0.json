Weakening of the supporting structures allows the uterus to move out of its normal position and fall into the vagina.

The uterus is where the fetus nests and develops. The uterus expands during pregnancy to accommodate the baby and then shrinks in size after birth.\nPelvic floor diseases are dysfunctions in the pelvic floor organs due to the impact of the weight of pregnancy and the stretching pressure of childbirth. This is one of the most common problems in women.\nUterine prolapse during pregnancy and postpartum can vary depending on how weak the uterine support is. In cases of partial genital prolapse, the uterus may have slipped and entered the vaginal birth canal, creating a lump or bulge.
