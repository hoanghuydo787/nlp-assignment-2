However, when the uterus slips further out of position, this can put pressure on other pelvic organs – such as the bladder or bowel – and cause symptoms such as:\nVaginal symptoms\nFeeling of heaviness or pressure in the pelvic area;; Seeing or feeling a bulge;; Feeling of heaviness and pressure in the vagina;; Abnormal or excessive discharge from the vagina;; The cervix descends through the vaginal opening;; Pain in the pelvis, lower abdomen or back.\nUrinary symptoms\nFrequent bladder infections;; Urinary problems, including incontinence with frequent urination, urgency or urinary incontinence.\nBowel symptoms\nUncontrolled flatulence, loose or solid stools; Constipation; Need to use hands or push (impact around the vagina or perineum) to make defecation easier.\nSexual symptoms\nPain or difficulty during intercourse;; Reduced sexual sensation.\nSymptoms may get worse when you stand or walk for long periods of time. In these  activities gravity puts extra pressure on the pelvic muscles.",
