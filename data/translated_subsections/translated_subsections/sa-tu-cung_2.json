    "subsection_content": "Uterine prolapse can affect women of any age from 20 years and older, especially women who have given birth or have gone through menopause. Nearly half of women between the ages of 50 and 79 have had pelvic organ prolapse or some other form of pelvic organ prolapse. Cervical prolapse is also likely to occur in women with a family history (grandmother, mother, sister, or sibling) of this condition.\nMenopause occurs when your ovaries stop producing the hormones that regulate your monthly menstrual cycle (period). When you have not had a period for 12 consecutive months, you are considered menopausal. One of the hormones that stops working during menopause is estrogen. This particular hormone helps keep your pelvic floor muscles healthy. If your pelvic floor muscles are less firm, weak, or flabby, you are at high risk of uterine prolapse.\nIn addition, women who often do heavy labor and manual labor are also susceptible to genital prolapse, especially those who often work in a standing position, bending, or carrying heavy objects because of pelvic pressure. The abdomen and perineum are always high. Uterine prolapse can also occur in women who have never given birth because they are weak, have thin ligaments, and the uterus is in an intermediate position aligned with the vagina, so when there is strong pressure in the abdomen, it will push the uterus. The bow gradually descends.",
