When these structures weaken, they cannot hold the uterus in place and it begins to sag. Several factors can contribute to weakening of the pelvic muscles, including:\nLoss of muscle tone due to aging;; Trauma during childbirth, especially if you give birth to multiple children or the fetus has a large weight;; Obesity or high body mass index;; Chronic coughing puts downward pressure on the pelvic floor;; Constipation.",
