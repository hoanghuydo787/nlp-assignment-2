Four degrees of prolapse include:\nStage I: The uterus is located in the upper half of the vagina;; Stage II: The uterus has descended almost to the vaginal opening or 1cm or more inwards from the vaginal opening;; Stage III: The uterus slides down and protrudes largely out of the vagina;; Stage IV: This is the most severe stage when the entire uterus prolapses completely outside the vagina.",
