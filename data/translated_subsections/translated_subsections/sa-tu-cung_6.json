During a gynecological examination, the doctor will use a speculum to examine the vagina and uterus, helping to detect bulges caused by the uterus falling into the vaginal canal. (3)\nAdditionally, your doctor may test your pelvic floor by asking you to push down in a supine or standing position, which can help assess how well the uterus has slid into your vagina. Your doctor may also ask you to squeeze your pelvic floor muscles as if stopping the flow of urine to test the strength of your pelvic floor muscles. This test can be done while you are lying down or while standing up.",
