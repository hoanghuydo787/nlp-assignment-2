    "subsection_content": "Postpartum uterine prolapse can be treated surgically and non-surgically. Depending on the patient's condition and treatment goals, whether they want to have children in the future or not, the doctor will recommend appropriate treatment regimens for you. Treatment methods such as:\nSurgical options\nHysterectomy and cervical prolapse repair: The disease can be treated classically with a hysterectomy. Hysterectomy is used in the most severe cases of uterine prolapse with most surgeries performed being total or partial hysterectomies (removal of part of the uterus but not the cervix). Your doctor will decide which hysterectomy is appropriate for your specific condition. In addition, any part of the vaginal wall, urethra, bladder or rectum can be operated on at the same time. A hysterectomy is a major surgery, and removing the uterus means pregnancy is no longer possible.; Laparoscopic, open or vaginal uterine suspension: surgery is used to perform uterine suspension, restoring uterine support and the structure of the pelvic floor. Doctors can use insoluble synthetic grafts (which last a lifetime after being placed in the body) to replace your own damaged fascia, fascia, and ligament structures. These advanced, highly technical pelvic floor rehabilitation surgeries are now widely used around the world because they are minimally invasive and effective for treating cervical prolapse.\nNon-surgical options\nPelvic floor exercises: Special exercises, called Kegels, can help strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. This may be the only treatment needed in mild cases of uterine prolapse. To do Kegel exercises, tighten your pelvic muscles as if you are trying to hold back urine. Hold the muscle tight for a few seconds then release. Repeat 10 times. You can do these exercises anywhere and anytime (4-6 times/day).\nReference: Exercises to treat uterine prolapse at home\nPelvic floor physical therapy with an intensive pelvic floor exercise machine: pelvic floor exercise protocols on the machine are updated according to existing protocols in the world, biofeedback training, electromyography stimulation with intra-sound probes vaginal probe, intra-anal probe or electromyography patch around the anal area help specifically treat pelvic floor diseases of the urinary tract, genital tract or anal tract.; Placing a uterine pessary (Pessary) in the  vagina: A vaginal pessary is a device that fits inside your vagina to hold the uterus in place. Uterine augmentation is used to treat moderate to severe disease, and can be a temporary or permanent treatment option depending on the appropriateness and acceptability of each person. Your doctor will thoroughly examine your pelvic floor to prescribe the right type and size of the implant for you, and you will learn how to use it (insertion, removal, and cleaning) to help relieve your symptoms. Your doctor will also advise you on the appropriate uterine implant if you are still sexually active. Vaginal female hormone medications are often used in the first 1 to 2 weeks after inserting the IUD to increase tolerance and reduce irritation, pressure on vaginal tissue, erosion, and vaginal bleeding.; Estrogen replacement therapy: Estrogen replacement therapy can help slow the weakening of the pelvic muscles and connective tissue that support the uterus. There are some side effects, such as increased risk of blood clots, gallbladder disease, and breast cancer. You need to consult your doctor for appropriate estrogen replacement therapy or discontinue use. Follow-up every 3 - 6 months if using hormone replacement.",
