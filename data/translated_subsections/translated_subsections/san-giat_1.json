Pregnant women will enter eclampsia when symptoms such as convulsions, deep coma, etc. appear.\nThe cause of the disease may stem from abnormalities in the formation and function of the placenta. Blood flow to the placenta is reduced, limiting the nourishment of the fetus. Explaining this phenomenon, experts say it may stem from the following reasons:\n1. High blood pressure\nComplications occur when a pregnant woman's blood pressure increases, the force of blood transfusion on the artery wall is not large enough, affecting the arteries and other blood vessels. This phenomenon can cause swelling of blood vessels in the brain and growing fetus in the abdomen. Abnormal blood flow will hinder the brain's ability to function, which can cause seizures - a characteristic symptom of eclampsia.\nIt is recommended to control pregnant women's blood pressure at a stable level to prevent the risk of this obstetric complication\n2. Proteinuria\nThe disease can affect kidney function. Normally, the kidneys filter waste from the blood and create urine. However, the kidneys will retain nutrients in the blood such as proteinuria (protein in urine) to redistribute to the body. When the glomerulus - the kidney's filter - is damaged, protein can leak and be excreted into the urine. Therefore, the doctor may prescribe a urine sample from the pregnant woman to test for protein.",
