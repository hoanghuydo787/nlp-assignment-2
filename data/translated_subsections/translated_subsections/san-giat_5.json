For pregnant women who have never had the disease, the doctor can prescribe necessary tests to determine the risk of the pregnant woman having this syndrome or not.\nThese tests include:\n1. Blood test\nThe doctor may prescribe some necessary blood tests to evaluate the pregnant woman's condition. Tests include a complete blood count, measuring the amount of red blood cells in the blood, and platelet counts to determine blood clotting.\nIn addition, blood tests also help check the function and status of pregnant women's liver and kidneys.\n2. Creatinine test\nCreatinine is a waste product created by muscle metabolism. The kidneys will filter all creatinine from the blood. If the glomerulus is damaged, the risk of excess creatinine in the blood is very high (2). Excessive residue of this substance in a pregnant woman's blood can be one of the signs of preeclampsia - eclampsia.\n3. Urine test\nYour doctor may prescribe a urine test to check for proteinuria, as well as the excretion rate of this organ.",
