In case of serious medical condition\nWhen a pregnant woman experiences serious complications, her doctor may advise her to terminate her pregnancy. The fetus may be born prematurely, and the preterm infant care plan prescribed depends on the length of pregnancy and the severity of the illness.\nBesides, controlling blood pressure during pregnancy is very important. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends antihypertensive treatment for pregnant women with systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 110mmHg (3). Controlling blood pressure is also important for about 48 hours after giving birth because the risk of pregnant women experiencing eclampsia is highest. Therefore, systolic blood pressure should be controlled < 150mmHg and diastolic blood pressure < 100mmHg on two occasions, read at least 4 hours apart.\n3. Medicines to treat eclampsia\nYour doctor may prescribe certain medications to prevent seizures in pregnant women, called anticonvulsants. In addition, pregnant women also need to use medicine in case of high blood pressure.",
