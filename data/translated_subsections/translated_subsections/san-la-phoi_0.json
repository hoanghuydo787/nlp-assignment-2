    "subsection_content": "Lung fluke (Paragonimus spp.) is a species of flatworm that lives parasitically in the human lungs, specifically the bronchioles. People get sick from eating shrimp and crabs infected with lung fluke larvae that are not cooked. Flukes can move to the central nervous system, causing meningitis. (first)\nThere are up to 40 different species of lung flukes, but only more than 10 species cause disease in humans. In other countries, the main disease-causing species is Paragonimus westermani, in Vietnam it is Paragonimus heterotremus.\n1. Physical characteristics\nAdult flukes: lung flukes are 7-13 mm long, 4-6 mm wide, the size of peanuts or coffee beans.; Lung fluke eggs: 80 - 120 µm long - 4-8 µm wide, with dark brown color, oval shape, lid, thick shell, containing embryo inside.; Larvae: adult lung flukes must go through many different larval stages, from hairy larvae to tailed larvae and cystic larvae before becoming adult flukes.; Reproduction: lung flukes are hermaphrodites, hermaphrodites, having both male and female genitals.\n2. Biological characteristics\nReservoir: humans are the main hosts for parasitic lung flukes, in addition some animals such as dogs, pigs, cats... can still be infected.; When infecting humans: After 2-15 days, the patient appears initial symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. The next few days included fever, chest pain and fatigue. In addition, some people have a dry cough, a cough with rust-colored or blood-tinged phlegm when the cough is severe, and coughs more often like people with tuberculosis.; Pathophysiology: Lung flukes nest in the lungs, causing localized necrosis of the lung parenchyma, creating fibrous cysts; In addition, flukes also cause disease in other internal organs, causing inflammation, abscesses, and granulomas.\n3.
