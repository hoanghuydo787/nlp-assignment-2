In the early stages of the disease, patients often have localized necrosis of the lung parenchyma, then fibrocystic cysts appear surrounding the adult flukes. By 7-8 weeks after infection, the lung fluke is completely mature and begins to lay eggs in the cyst. This cyst grows rapidly and can rupture in the bronchiole.; In other organs: if the larvae in the duodenum do not move to the lungs but wander to other internal organs, they will still develop into young tapeworms and can create cysts and lay eggs in locations outside the lungs, causing inflammation. abscess, granuloma.",
