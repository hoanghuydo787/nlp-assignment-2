(first)\nWhen entering the human body, they are released through the intestinal wall and into the blood to travel throughout the body. At this time, there are 2 situations happening:\nSituation 1: If they go to the tissues, muscles under the skin, or tongue, after 9-10 weeks, they become larval cysts (called pig rice). After 1 year, this larval cyst dies and calcify, no longer capable of causing infection; Situation 2: If they reach the stomach, the small intestine will take advantage of digestive enzymes to release, the bright head protrudes, sticks to the intestinal mucosa to develop into an adult fluke in just  2 months. They parasitize mainly in the body's jejunum - where there are many nutrients to feed rice tapeworms. Every day, 4-5 old tapeworm segments containing tapeworm eggs will fall out and be excreted in the stool, even coming out of the anus on their own.\nIf people defecate indiscriminately, tapeworm eggs are spread by the wind, the water of rivers, streams, ponds, lakes... scattered everywhere, sticking to food, drinking water sources, fields and gardens... At this time, if people are unlucky Swallowing tapeworm larvae or pigs swallowing eggs or burning tapeworms... the life cycle of rice tapeworms is repeated.",
