    "subsection_content": "After 24 - 72 hours of eating raw, undercooked meat or food or water contaminated with tapeworm eggs, the larvae pass through the stomach to the small intestine, attacking the circulatory system throughout the body.; During the next 2 months, they reside in the connective tissue between muscles and the larvae form cysts with an outer shell with a length of 17-20 mm and a width of 7-10 mm, popularly known as \"pig rice\". or “rice pig” (cysticercus cellulosae). Inside the cyst there is white fluid with a tapeworm head. Under the effect of duodenal fluid, the tapeworm head escapes from the cyst and attaches to the intestinal mucosa, developing into an adult tapeworm.; 67-72 days later, the adult fluke has old segments to push out of the anus, forming new fluke cycles.; Adult flukes can live up to 25 years.",
