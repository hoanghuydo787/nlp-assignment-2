In particular, patients infected with rice tapeworm larvae in the nervous system are easily confused with encephalitis or meningitis caused by amoeba or bacteria; Craniopharyngioma, medulloblastoma; Tuberculosis meningitis, astrocytoma in the central nervous system...\nTo diagnose the disease, a stool test for eggs, a CT scan, and possibly an MRI scan or serum test are needed when the patient has symptoms in the central nervous system.",
