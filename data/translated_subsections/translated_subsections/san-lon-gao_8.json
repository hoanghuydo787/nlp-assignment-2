Specifically, when having an intestinal infection, the patient is given 5-10 mg/kg of body weight with praziquantel, a single dose to kill adult worms from the body.\nHowever, for patients with neurocysticercosis (whether symptomatic or not), be cautious when using praziquantel, because when eliminating hydatid cysts, praziquantel can cause an inflammatory reaction related to seizures or other complications. other symptoms. As for niclosamide, the doctor prescribed 4 tablets (500 mg each) to be chewed once, but for children, only use 50 mg/kg (maximum 2 g) once.\nFor patients with nervous system manifestations: treatment is very complicated, doctors prescribe anticonvulsants, corticosteroids, sometimes with albendazole or praziquantel; Maybe even surgery. Corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation and reduce increased intracranial pressure. In addition, people with seizures can take regular epilepsy medications.\nIn cases where the patient has increased intracranial pressure or there are tapeworm larvae in the brain, surgical intervention can be performed.",
