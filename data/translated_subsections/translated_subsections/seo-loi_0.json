    "subsection_content": "Keloid scars are rough raised scars on the skin surface due to the proliferation of fibrous tissue that is too much compared to the wound and causes scarring. Specifically, when the skin is injured, fibrous tissue forms to repair the wound. However, in some people, this fibrous tissue proliferates excessively, forming a hard, shiny mass called a keloid.\nCurrently, about 100 million people in the world have scars due to surgery or trauma, of which 15% of cases have fibrous tissue that progresses excessively into hypertrophic scars or keloid scars. Keloid scars can occur at any age, appear anywhere on the body, but  often occur in body areas such as: Shoulders, earlobes, chest, cheeks, buttocks,...\nKeloid scars on earlobes are usually round and firm; on other parts of the body, they will have a flatter surface. However, on some parts of the body such as: Neck, abdomen, ears,... keloid scars move slightly when touched.\nKeloid scars extend beyond the boundaries of the original wound, invading adjacent normal skin. Although keloid scars are not harmful to health, they make patients feel less confident, especially in the arms, legs, etc.\nFor people who are prone to keloid scars, even a small scratch can lead to keloid scars",
