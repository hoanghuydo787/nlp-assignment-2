    "subsection_content": "Perennial keloid scars\nKeloid scars tend to grow slowly, spreading over weeks, months, or years. However, in some people, keloid scars can grow rapidly, tripling in size in a few months. Keloid scars come in different sizes, and the patient will feel tender, itchy, or painful as the keloid develops. This symptom usually goes away when the keloid stops growing.\nNewly formed keloid scars\nThe body produces too much collagen during scar formation to repair wounds. In the body, collagen plays a role in maintaining skin elasticity and supporting muscle, bone, and tissue structure.\nKeloid scars usually appear about 3 - 12 months after injury. At first, keloid scars are red, pink or purple but will eventually turn darker than the skin, with the edges darker than the center. These scars appear as shiny, hairless lumps of skin. (first)",
