When skin is damaged, the body produces pigment cells (melanocytes), so there is more melanin in the injured area. Therefore, black people have more melanin than other races, so the possibility of keloid scars is higher.; Genetics: About 1/3 of people with keloids have a family member who has had keloids (more common in people of African or Asian descent.); Age (10 - 30 years old): Keloid scars can appear at any time, but the age range from 10 - 30 years old is the stage when keloid scars are easily formed because collagen is more active.; Pregnancy: Hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy increase the risk of keloid formation.
