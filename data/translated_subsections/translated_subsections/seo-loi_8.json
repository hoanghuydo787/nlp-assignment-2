    "subsection_content": "There are many methods to treat keloid scars, the doctor will use one or a combination of treatment methods depending on the condition. Frequently used keloid treatment methods include:\nWound care: For new keloid scars, treatment may include compression bandages made from stretchy fabric or other materials. This method is used after surgery to remove keloid scars. To reduce or prevent scarring after surgery, it is necessary to apply pressure on the wound by wearing a compression bandage for 12 - 24 hours a day and lasting 4 - 6 months to be effective. However, when performing this method, the patient feels very uncomfortable; Use corticosteroid cream: Apply prescription corticosteroid cream to help relieve itching.; Injections: If the keloid is small, the doctor will reduce the thickness of the scar by injecting cortisone or other steroids. Patients need monthly injections (up to 6 months) before the scar flattens. However, when injecting corticosteroids, it is easy to cause side effects such as: skin thinning, spider veins, skin color changes (decreased or increased skin pigmentation).; Cryotherapy: Small keloid scars that want to reduce or eliminate them will be frozen with liquid nitrogen. Side effects that occur when using this method include: blistering, pain, loss of skin color (hypopigmentation).; Laser treatment: Large keloid scars are flattened by treatment with multiple pulsed dye laser sessions (4 - 8 weeks between sessions) to reduce itching and fade scars. Your doctor may combine laser therapy with cortisone injections. Possible side effects include: hypo- or hyperpigmentation, blistering, scaling (more common in people with darker skin).; Radiation: Using low-level radiation (Phosphorus 32 or X-rays) helps shrink or reduce scar tissue. However, radiation has side effects that can easily cause skin cancer complications; Surgery: If the above treatment methods do not reduce keloid scars, the doctor will remove them by surgery combined with other methods.\nIf keloid scars are not treated early, there is a risk of spreading to neighboring skin areas",
