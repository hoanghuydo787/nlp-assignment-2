    "subsection_content": "Pitted scars are a skin condition where deep depressions of uneven size and shape appear on the skin's surface, so they are also called pitted scars. When the fibroblast organization in the dermis is damaged, broken, and does not produce collagen or elastin, it loses the ability to regenerate skin and cannot fill the wound, so when the wound heals, it leaves dents on the skin.\nAlthough this condition does not cause itching or discomfort, and does not affect health, the pits on the skin (especially on the face) make the patient lack confidence.",
