This is one of the types of pitted scars that is difficult to treat.\n2. Square leg-shaped scar\nSquare-shaped scars often have vertical edges and are wider than sharp-bottomed scars. They look like a large dent or crater that is common under the cheeks and jaw. Square-shaped scars are formed from squeezing acne incorrectly or as a result of chickenpox.\n3. Round bottom shaped scar\nTo distinguish round-bottom scars from other types of pitted scars, patients observe the following characteristics: the indentations have steep edges, undulating on the wavy surface, making the skin look less smooth. Round-bottom scars, also known as wavy scars, are commonly found on the lower cheeks and chin, where your skin is thicker.\n4.
