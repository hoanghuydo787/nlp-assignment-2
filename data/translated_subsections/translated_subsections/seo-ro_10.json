    "subsection_content": "Currently, there are many different ways to treat pitted scars, including popular methods such as:\n1. Natural ingredients\nIngredients like pennywort, aloe vera, fresh turmeric, green tea powder,... are very suitable to support the treatment of pitted scars because they contain vitamins A, E, B1, B6,... to help protect and regenerate the skin, increasing Collagen production and anti-oxidation.\nWith the above ingredients, just grind and gently apply to the scarred area, leave for about 15 - 20 minutes and rinse with water. If using fresh turmeric or green tea powder, add honey, or squeeze a little lemon juice when using aloe vera.\nThe natural way to treat pitted scars is easy to do, you need to apply it for a long time to see the effect. However, this method is not effective in cases of severe pitted scars.\n2. Chemical peels method\nChemical peels method (skin peel or biological skin peeling) is based on the use of organic acids such as alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) or beta hydroxy acid (BHA) or trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to stimulate the peeling process. epidermis, promoting skin renewal and regeneration. The skin peels method can overcome many skin problems such as: acne, pitted scars, dark spots, large pores... at a cost many times lower than other high-tech treatments such as: micro-abrasion, laser photothermal…\n3. Create fake lesions\nCreate fake lesions with 2 main methods: needle rolling and microneedling.\nMicroneedling uses small needles to roll on the surface, causing small injuries to stimulate collagen production to improve skin conditions such as melasma, scars, baldness, and wrinkles.\nMicroneedling uses tiny needles to impact the skin's epidermis to replace old cells. Then, nutrients extracted from seaweed, fermented plants... are injected deep into the skin to nourish and regenerate the skin.\nMicroneedles are mainly located in the epidermal layer of the skin and do not cause pain, suitable for skin with mild or moderate pitted scars. Microneedling is more painful because the intervention is deeper than microneedling, bringing noticeable results after each treatment.\n4. Dermabrasion\nDoctors use a handheld device called a dermabrasion machine, which creates friction to remove the outer layers of skin. This method is painless because it only affects the surface of the skin and one session of dermabrasion takes about 30 - 40 minutes.\nThere are three popular types of microdermabrasion: hydrodermabrasion, microdermabrasion with diamond crystals, and microdermabrasion with crystal crystals. Because it only affects the surface, microdermabrasion requires you to persevere and do it many times to get the expected results.\n5. Filler injection\nFiller injection is chosen by many people with quick results after implementation. This method injects filler into the dermis or dermis at the location of pitted scars with the purpose of raising the skin surface, supporting subcutaneous tissue and filling pitted scars. Fillers are usually in liquid or gel form, usually collagen, or autologous fat similar to natural substances in the body.\nDepending on the location, filler injections last for 4-6 months, then dissolve and the skin returns to the state before the filler was injected. In addition, this method can have dangerous complications if the filler is of unknown origin, of poor quality, or the filler is injected incorrectly, causing the scar structure to change.\n6. Laser reconstruction\nThere are 2 types of laser skin resurfacing: fractional CO2 laser and non-invasive laser. Depending on the condition of pitted scars or the nature of your skin, the dermatologist - skin aesthetician will determine which laser method is appropriate.\nFractional CO2 laser therapy helps stimulate cell regeneration beneath the scar. Using laser light to shine on pitted scars, burns the outermost layer in the scarred skin area and stimulates new cell growth. After a while, the pits are slightly reduced.\nAblative laser is a form of treatment that removes pitted skin using laser beams. This ablative laser resurfacing takes several weeks of care and recovery, but the results last for years, with no additional treatments required. However, this therapy has some risks such as changes in skin color, redness, and swelling. In some cases, this method makes acne or scars worse.\nThe patient after a week of treating pitted scars at Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City",
