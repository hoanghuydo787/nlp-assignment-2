    "subsection_content": "To avoid headaches, loss of confidence, or wasting time and money treating pitted scars, you need to create skin care habits such as: (3)\n1. Take care of your skin properly when you have acne\nWhen you have acne, you should not use your hands to squeeze or deliberately remove the acne core, which can easily lead to infection. You need to remove makeup, wash your face thoroughly and use a pimple popper or wash your hands to remove the pimples under the skin. After squeezing acne, apply facial mask to moisturize skin. This method helps the skin have a certain moisture and reduces the risk of inflammation with newly removed acne spots.\n2. Use sunscreen\nYou should use sunscreen when going out to avoid dirt from sticking deep into the skin and harmful rays to the skin. If you don't go out and sit in a well-lit location, you should still use sunscreen, because ultraviolet rays can still penetrate the skin here.\n3. Exfoliate\nTo treat current acne and prevent further breakouts, it is necessary to keep pores clear and support skin cell regeneration. Choose gentle exfoliating products that contain ingredients such as: cleansers containing AHAs (like glycolic acid), BHAs (like salicylic acid), and retinol are all helpful.\n4. Take medication as prescribed\nIf your acne does not improve after a few months of acne treatment, see your doctor to adjust or review your prescription.",
