    "subsection_content": "The degree of preterm birth is often described according to gestational age, usually divided into 4 levels:\nExtremely premature: A baby born before 28 weeks of gestation; Very premature:  A baby born between 28 – 31 weeks 6 days; Moderately premature: A baby born between 32 - 33 weeks and 6 days; Late prematurity: A baby born between 34 - 36 weeks and 6 days\nMost moderately and mildly premature babies (approximately 80%) have a gestational age of over 32 - 37 weeks, weighing > 1,500g - 2,500g. These children are still at high risk of death because of lack of basic care such as keeping warm, breastfeeding, hygiene and infection prevention. In low-income countries, about 10 - 13% of babies are born at a gestational age of 28 - 32 weeks and more than half of these babies die due to lack of intensive care.",
