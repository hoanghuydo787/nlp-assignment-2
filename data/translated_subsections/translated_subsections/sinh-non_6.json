    "subsection_content": "If there are signs of premature birth, mothers should choose a hospital with specialized care for premature infants (NICU). If the hospital where the baby is born does not have a NICU, the woman and her unborn baby should be transferred to another hospital for the best support.\nDuring labor, women may be given medication to stop contractions for a time. This allows women to be transferred to another hospital if necessary. Corticosteroids may be given 12 to 24 hours before birth to help the baby's lungs work more effectively. Premature babies can be born very quickly through the vagina. However, in some cases, your doctor may decide that a cesarean section is safest. Therefore, whether premature babies should be born naturally or by cesarean section depends on many factors.\nFor newborns, the 60 minutes after birth and the first 28 days of life are critical to their survival. With more than 30 years of experience in resuscitating and raising premature babies, Dr. Do Huu Thieu Chuong said that as soon as they leave the mother's womb, premature babies need to be kept warm with wraps, hats, and plastic bags. Keep warm and immediately transfer to a heated bed placed next to the birthing bed.\nDepending on each case, it is necessary to attach a non-invasive CPAP breathing tube to help prevent the baby's lungs from collapsing, limit infection, and prevent respiratory failure. Doctors also do a number of screening tests, especially screening for birth defects, screening for diseases to rule out congenital hypothyroidism, congenital hyperplasia, low G6PD, hearing screening...\nScreening for congenital heart disease using simple methods such as transcutaneous oxygen measurement or specialized measures if there are abnormalities or suspected abnormalities. Cases of severe congenital heart disease can be intervened very early, minimizing the risk of death and increasing the chance of a healthy life.",
