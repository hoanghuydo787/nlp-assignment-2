    "subsection_content": "Pregnant women\nPregnant women with premature babies may face many psychological obstacles. The mother may panic and worry about the baby's condition. Depending on the baby's condition, the doctor will have a care regimen, so pregnant women should rest and follow the doctor's instructions. A reasonable nutritional regimen, daily health monitoring, eliminating unusual problems such as fever, abdominal pain or lochia, breast pain, milk secretion... should also be noted.\nAfter giving birth, pregnant women are instructed to clean their bodies every day to avoid infection. 2-3 days after giving birth, the mother can take a quick bath with warm water. If the milk duct is clogged, it needs to be treated to avoid mastitis and breast abscess. For pregnant women having a cesarean section, it is important to wash the vulva after urinating and defecating to avoid perineal infection.\nAfter giving birth, mothers should receive proper care and nutritional supplementation. Many people have an excessive abstinence mentality, leading to insufficient nutrition in milk and milk loss. Early exercise after giving birth is encouraged for both mothers giving birth naturally and by cesarean section. If there are psychological problems, they need to be shared with everyone so that they can be resolved. In the first week after giving birth, mothers should have a check-up to ensure their health. safe.\nPremature babies\nPremature babies may need special care during the first 2 years. This is especially true if the baby weighs less than 1kg at birth. But you can help your child stay healthy, grow, and develop when you bring him or her home from the hospital. Here are some tips: (3)\nRegular check-ups with the doctor: Mothers need to take their babies for follow-up appointments to check and confirm that the baby is gaining weight and discuss more methods of caring for newborns at home.; Nutrition for children: Breast milk is the best food for children. But if your baby is having trouble feeding, your doctor can help you solve the problem. The baby can breastfeed directly or breastfeed through a bottle, depending on the baby's choice. Your baby may also need extra iron because premature babies don't have as much iron in their bodies as full-term babies. Monitor your baby's development: Premature babies may not develop at the same rate as full-term babies during the first 2 years. To monitor your child's development, your doctor may use growth charts, recording your baby's important milestones such as activity level, sitting up, and crawling.; Weaning regimen: Most doctors recommend introducing solid foods to premature babies 4-6 months after the baby's original due date (not the date of birth). Premature babies do not develop like full-term babies. It may take longer for your baby to develop the ability to swallow.; Sleep duration of newborns: Although premature babies sleep more hours per day than full-term babies, they sleep for shorter periods of time. All newborns, including premature babies, should be placed on their back, not their stomach. Sleeping on your stomach and sleeping on a soft mattress may increase your risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).; Check your child's vision and hearing: Premature babies are more likely to have crossed eyes than full-term babies. This condition usually disappears on its own as the baby grows older. Some premature babies have an eye condition called retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). If there is a possibility that your child has ROP, your doctor will recommend that you take your child to an eye doctor for regular checkups. ROP can be treated to help prevent  vision loss. Babies are also more likely to have hearing problems than full-term babies. You can test your baby's hearing by making noises behind or next to the baby. If your baby does not turn or respond to a loud noise, contact your doctor.; Vaccination for children: Full vaccination protects the baby from invading pathogens. Premature babies are more likely to get the flu than full-term babies. A flu vaccination plan for your whole family can help protect your baby from getting the flu from someone in the family.\nIn particular, premature infants need to be screened at birth with in-depth exploratory tests to screen for potential health risks that are not clearly evident clinically. Parents can see more newborn screening packages to help early detect 73 common endocrine, metabolic, and genetic disorders in newborns here.",
