    "subsection_content": "Bladder stones can develop when your bladder cannot empty completely. This causes urine to become stagnant and concentrated. Concentrated urine can crystallize and form stones.\nSome infections can lead to bladder stones. Sometimes an underlying condition that affects the bladder's ability to hold, or empty, urine can lead to the formation of bladder stones. Any foreign material present in the bladder tends to form stones in the bladder.\nThe most common conditions that cause bladder stones include:\nProstatic hypertrophy: (benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH) can cause bladder stones in men. An enlarged prostate can obstruct the flow of urine, preventing the bladder from emptying completely.; Nerve damage: Normally, nerves carry messages from the brain to the bladder muscles, controlling the bladder muscles to contract or relax. If these nerves are damaged by a stroke, spinal cord injury, or other health problems, your bladder may back up with urine. This is called a neurogenic bladder.\nOther possible causes of bladder stones include:\nCystitis: sometimes urinary tract infection or pelvic radiation therapy, can lead to bladder stones.; Medical tools and equipment: Bladder catheters, small tubes inserted through the urethra to help urine exit the bladder, can cause bladder stones over time. When objects accidentally move into your bladder, such as birth control devices or catheters in the urinary tract. Mineral crystals, which later become gravel, tend to form on the surface of these devices.; Kidney stones: Stones that form in your kidneys are not the same as bladder stones. They develop in different ways. But small kidney stones can travel down the ureters into the bladder and, if not expelled, can develop into bladder stones.",
