    "subsection_content": "There are two types of gallstones: cholesterol stones and pigment stones. Both types have distinct epidemiological and risk factors.\n1. Cholesterol stones\nThis type accounts for 80% of gallstones, and is often associated with obstruction and inflammation. Cholesterol stones are yellow-green in color and are mainly made up of hard cholesterol. Women and obese people, which are associated with bile that is oversaturated with cholesterol, are often susceptible to cholesterol stones.(5)\n2. Pigment stones\nThere are two types of pigment stones: black stones and brown stones.\nBlack pigment stones: Made up of pure calcium bilirubinate or a complex of calcium, copper and mucin glycoprotein. These gallstones often form in states of stasis (eg, parenteral nutrition) or excess unconjugated bilirubin (eg, hemolysis or cirrhosis). Black pigment stones are more likely to remain in the gallbladder.; Black pigment stones: Made up of pure calcium bilirubinate or a complex of calcium, copper and mucin glycoprotein. These gallstones often form in states of stasis (eg, parenteral nutrition) or excess unconjugated bilirubin (eg, hemolysis or cirrhosis). Black pigment stones are more likely to remain in the gallbladder.; Brown pigment stones: Made up of the calcium salt of unconjugated bilirubin with small amounts of cholesterol and protein. These stones are often located in the bile ducts, causing blockage and are often found in areas where bile is infected. Brown pigment stones are common in Asian patients and are rarely seen in patients in the United States.; Brown pigment stones: Made up of the calcium salt of unconjugated bilirubin with small amounts of cholesterol and protein.
