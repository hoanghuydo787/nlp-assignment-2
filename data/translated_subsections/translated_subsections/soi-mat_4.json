    "subsection_content": "Gallstones form when bile stored in the gallbladder hardens into solid pieces of material. This process requires three conditions:\nFirst condition: Bile must be saturated with cholesterol. This can occur with excess cholesterol with normal amounts of bile salts or normal cholesterol levels with reduced amounts of bile salts. Second condition: Accelerated cholesterol crystal nucleation or rapid transition from liquid to crystal. This occurs when there is an excess of nucleation factors or an absence of nucleation inhibitors. Third condition: Gallbladder hypomotility, a condition in which crystals remain in the gallbladder long enough to form stones; First condition: Bile must be saturated with cholesterol. This can occur with excess cholesterol with normal amounts of bile salts or normal cholesterol levels with reduced amounts of bile salts.; Second condition: Accelerated cholesterol crystal nucleation or rapid transition from liquid to crystal.
