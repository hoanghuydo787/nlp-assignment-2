    "subsection_content": "The diagnosis of gallstones will be made by the doctor by examining the patient's health and may request additional tests if gallstones are suspected.(4)\nBlood tests: To check for signs of infection or blockage and rule out other conditions. Ultrasound: Helps doctors observe images inside the patient's body to detect gallstones. CT scan: Allows doctors to see the gallbladder and intra/extrahepatic biliary system to detect stones. Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP): A technique that uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to create images of the liver, gallbladder, biliary tract and pancreas. Cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan): This method helps doctors check whether the gallbladder is contracting correctly. Your doctor will inject a harmless radioactive substance that finds its way to the organ. A technician can then watch the movement of the gallbladder. If gallbladder movement is not normal, gallstones may be present. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): The doctor inserts an endoscope with a camera through the mouth down the first part of the small intestine and into the common bile duct to detect stones. At the same time, ERCP can help remove stones stuck at the end of the common bile duct.
