Treatments for gallstones include:\nGallbladder removal: Can be performed by open or laparoscopic surgery. After gallbladder surgery, gallstones can recur within a year. To help prevent this, people with gallstones should be given ursodeoxycholic acid to limit stone formation.; Gallbladder removal: Can be performed by open or laparoscopic surgery.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is performed by the doctor giving the patient local anesthesia and then using a flexible fiber optic camera, or endoscope, to go into the mouth, through the digestive system and into the common bile duct.
