    "subsection_content": "The ureter is a long tube (about 25cm) that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder. The closer the ureter gets, the narrower it becomes. Ureteral stones are usually stones that move from the kidney to the ureter. This type of stone blocks the flow of urine from the kidneys to the bladder. This blockage leads to urine stagnation, which can lead to dangerous complications over time. (first)\nThe location of the stone can be in any part of the ureter, the most common are 3 physiological narrowing locations of the ureter such as:\nThe segment connecting the kidney to the ureter; The segment connecting the ureters to the bladder.; The ureter lies anterior to the iliac artery.\nUsually, the number of stones is one. In some cases, there may be multiple stones or a series of stones. The ureteral segment where stones appear is often inflamed and thickened, the upper ureteral segment is dilated and atrophied, and the lower ureteral segment is narrowed.\nWhen stones first appear, the patient will not notice any symptoms. This stage usually lasts 2 years and has no complications. If detected and treated medically during this stage, treatment effectiveness can be up to 80%.",
