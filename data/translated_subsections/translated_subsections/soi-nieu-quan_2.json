    "subsection_content": "Ureteral stones are made up of crystals in urine that clump together. Stones often form in the kidney before entering the ureters. Not all ureteral stones are made up of the same crystals. Pebbles can be made from different types of crystals such as: (2)\nCalcium oxalate: Stones made up of calcium oxalate crystals are the most common. Dehydration of the patient's body combined with a diet rich in oxalate-rich foods will increase the risk of developing stones.; Uric acid: Uric acid stones often appear when purine metabolism in the body increases. Common causes of this condition are supplementing a lot of purine-rich foods (pork intestines, beef intestines, dried fish meat, mushrooms...), gout, and decomposition of cancerous tumors when using chemotherapy drugs. Uric acid is easily soluble in alkaline environments, easily crystallizes in acidic environments, when the pH of urine is <6. Accordingly, acidified urine is the ideal environment to form stones.; Struvite: Struvite stones are formed due to urinary tract infections. The bacteria causing the infection cause a buildup of ammonia in the urine, leading to stone formation. Struvite stones often increase in size very quickly.; Cystine: Cystine stones are very rare in Vietnam. Stones form when the kidneys excrete too much cystine (an amino acid in urine), but it is less soluble so it easily accumulates. The cause of the condition is a congenital disorder of cystine reabsorption in the kidney tubules and intestinal mucosa.\nSome factors can increase the risk of forming ureteral stones such as:\nFamily history: If a family member has kidney or ureteral stones, your chances of getting the disease will increase.; Not drinking enough water every day will increase the risk of forming stones in the urinary system. In addition, people who live in warm climates and people who sweat a lot are at higher risk of getting the disease than others.; Diet: A diet containing foods rich in sodium, animal protein, and calcium oxalate will increase the risk of stone formation. In addition, supplementing too much vitamin C can also cause you to face the risk of stones appearing in the urinary system.; Obesity: Large waist size, overweight, uncontrolled weight gain are factors that increase the likelihood of ureteral stone formation.; Side effects of medications: Medications such as decongestants, diuretics, steroids, and anticonvulsants can increase the likelihood of stone formation.; Some other factors that increase the risk of disease include recurrent urinary tract infections, inflammatory bowel disease, gout, and hyperparathyroidism.",
