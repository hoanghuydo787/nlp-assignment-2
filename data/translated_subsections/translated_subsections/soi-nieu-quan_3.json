    "subsection_content": "If treatment of ureteral stones is delayed, it will cause complications such as:\nWater retention in the kidneys, causing dilation of the renal pelvis: Because the stones have blocked the passage of urine, urine cannot get to the bladder to be eliminated. This condition causes urine to stagnate in the kidneys, dilating the renal pelvis, affecting kidney function.; Urinary tract infection: During the process of moving the stone, it damages the lining of the ureter. Stagnation of urine in the kidneys is a favorable opportunity for bacteria to multiply and develop, causing inflammation with symptoms such as high fever, chills, and pain in the lumbar region.; Acute kidney failure: This condition occurs when stones completely block the ureters on both sides, or stones get stuck in the ureter in only one kidney, leading to symptoms of anuria.; Chronic kidney failure: Prolonged urinary tract infections can lead to chronic kidney failure. The kidney cells are now damaged and cannot be restored.",
