In addition, some commonly applied diagnostic methods include:\nUltrasound: This is the initial means to suggest the diagnosis of ureteral stones with signs of hydronephrosis and dilated ureters. Ultrasound results often show ureteral stones in the upper ⅓ and lower ⅓ ureters; X-ray of the urinary system (KUB): This method can detect ureteral stones in about 60 - 80% of cases, except non-opaque stones such as uric acid stones, cystine stones.; CT scan (MSCT): This is a method that helps determine the location, size and opacification of stones, and the degree of obstruction with high accuracy (up to 96%).; Blood test: Blood test results will help the doctor determine whether there is too much calcium or uric acid in the patient's blood. Thereby, doctors can monitor kidney function, evaluate accompanying infections, and check for other diseases (if any).; Urine test: Used to evaluate whether there is a urinary tract infection or not. In addition, a urine sample from the last 24 hours can show whether the patient is excreting too many stone-forming minerals or too little stone-preventing substances. The doctor may ask the patient to perform this test on 2 consecutive days.",
