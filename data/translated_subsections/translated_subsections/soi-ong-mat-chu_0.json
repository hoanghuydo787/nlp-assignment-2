    "subsection_content": "Choledocholithiasis is the appearance of at least one gallstone in the main bile duct outside the liver (common bile duct). Stones can be made up of bile pigments or calcium and cholesterol salts.\nThe common bile duct is the tube that carries bile directly from the liver to the duodenum to aid in food digestion. Therefore, the common bile duct plays an important role in the circulation of bile. When stones appear in the bile duct, they can significantly reduce the amount of bile reaching the duodenum, causing bloating and slow digestion. Large stones will cause bile duct obstruction, leading to dangerous, life-threatening complications such as biliary tract infection, acute pancreatitis...",
