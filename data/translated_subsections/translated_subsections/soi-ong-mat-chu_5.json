    "subsection_content": "1. Cholangitis\nAs the size of common bile duct stones increases, it will cause blockage of the common bile duct, causing bile fluid to stagnate in the bile ducts in the liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts. This situation creates a favorable environment for harmful bacteria to invade and grow strongly, causing infection and cholangitis.\n2. Acute cholecystitis\nAcute cholecystitis is one of the extremely dangerous complications of common bile duct stones. This is a condition of bile obstruction and secondary infection in the gallbladder. Acute cholecystitis can cause gallbladder necrosis, bile leakage, and even death when timely intervention is provided.\nPeople with untreated common bile duct stones can develop acute cholecystitis\n3. Biliary tract bleeding\nObstruction of the common bile duct due to stones can cause bile stasis in the liver, causing serious impairment of liver function. Furthermore, this condition also damages the bile duct walls, affecting blood vessels, leading to biliary bleeding.\n4. Purulent cholangitis\nWhen the common bile duct is blocked, it can cause biliary tract infection. Therefore, when suffering from common bile duct stones, if the disease is not detected early and treated promptly, the infection will become more serious, forming a pus cavity, causing the patient a lot of pain, high fever and bile. pus.\n5. Biliary tract abscess, liver abscess\nCommon bile duct stones cause extrahepatic biliary tract infection. When this condition becomes severe, it can cause biliary tract abscess. The pus moves back up to the liver, leading to a liver abscess. This is one of the very serious complications of common bile duct stones. When experiencing this complication, the patient will feel severe pain in the right lower quadrant and symptoms of an enlarged liver appear.\n6. Biliary peritonitis\nThis is an extremely dangerous complication of common bile duct stones. This complication requires timely emergency surgical intervention. Bile peritonitis is a condition in which infected bile enters the abdominal cavity, localized in the right lower quadrant or spread throughout the abdomen, causing peritonitis.\n7. Septic shock, sepsis\nThis complication puts the patient at a very high risk of death. When there are signs such as high fever (over 39°C), fast heart rate (over 100 times/minute), rapid and shallow breathing, low blood pressure, mental disorders..., the patient needs immediate emergency treatment.",
