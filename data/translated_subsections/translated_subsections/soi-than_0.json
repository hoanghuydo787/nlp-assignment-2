    "subsection_content": "Kidney stones are a common urinary stone disease in middle-aged men. The age of onset is usually between 30 and 55 years old (1). Men have a more complex urinary tract structure, so stones are often difficult to pass on their own like in women.\nUrinary stones are solid particles formed by the natural crystallization of inorganic crystals in urine. They can cause pain, nausea and vomiting, hematuria and can cause fever and chills due to secondary infection. Most of them start to form in the kidneys, move along the urinary system and are excreted, so many people are familiar with the name kidney stones.\nWhen the urinary system begins to deposit and crystallize stones, the crystals and small stones often travel along the urinary tract and are excreted. At some point in the urinary tract, crystals or stones get stuck, continue to settle and crystallize to form larger stones.\nHere, the stones gradually grow larger in size, which can block the flow of urine, leading to urine stagnation and bulging above the blockage site. It is at this location that many complications will occur such as infection, crystallization and formation of different types of stones... gradually destroying the kidney structure.\nBased on the location of the stone in the urinary system, people can also name or classify stones:\nKidney stones are urinary stones located in the kidney, including renal calyces and renal pelvis stones.; Ureteral stones: caused by stones moving from the renal pelvis to the ureter and causing urinary tract obstruction.; Bladder stones: 80% are due to stones falling from the kidney or ureter or due to obstruction in the bladder neck and urethra; Urethral stones: when stones follow the urine stream from the bladder to the urethra, getting stuck here.",
