Calcium Oxalate accounts for a high proportion in tropical countries like Vietnam. This stone is very hard and radiopaque, has a rough shape, yellow or brown color; Common phosphate stones are Magnesium Ammonium Phosphate, also known as infectious stones, often caused by long-term urinary infections, especially by Proteus bacteria. The stones are yellow and slightly friable. This type of stone is often very large and can fill the renal pelvis causing coral stones.\nUric acid stones form due to increased purine metabolism in the body. Causes that can increase purine metabolism include consuming a lot of foods that contain a lot of purine (such as pork intestines, beef intestines, dried fish meat, mushrooms...), or patients with gout, or stones formed due to decomposition. cancerous tumors when using chemotherapy drugs; Cystine stones are formed due to errors in cystine reabsorption in the kidney tubules. This stone is relatively rare in Vietnam. Cystine stones are non-opaque stones with a smooth surface.",
