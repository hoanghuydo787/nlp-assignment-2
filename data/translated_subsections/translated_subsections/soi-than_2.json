That is when the onset occurs very suddenly, after a strenuous activity. Then the pain intensity becomes stronger. Patients often writhe in pain and struggle to find a position to relieve pain but cannot.\nWhen experiencing this symptom, the patient needs to immediately go to a health facility or hospital so that doctors can take measures to reduce the pain caused by kidney stones. Absolutely do not do it at home arbitrarily.\nTwo cases of kidney stone pain can be distinguished\nPain due to kidney stones due to obstruction of the renal pelvis and renal calyces: Pain appears in the lumbar fossa, below the 12th rib, pain spreads forward towards the navel and pelvic fossa.; Ureteral stone pain: originates from the lumbar fossa and spreads downward along the ureter, to the pelvic fossa, genitals, and inner thigh.\nSymptoms accompanying kidney stone pain are nausea, vomiting, and abdominal bloating due to paralytic ileus.
