    "subsection_content": "There are many causes of kidney stones, starting from crystallization and crystal deposition in the urinary system. According to experts, urinary stones can form due to urine containing too many chemicals, typically calcium, uric acid, cystine... 85% of stones formed start from calcium deposition.\nThe specific causes pointed out are:\nNot drinking enough water: The body does not have enough water for the kidneys to excrete, urine is too concentrated. Concentration of saturated crystals in urine.; Diet high in salt: This is a common cause in Vietnamese people, Vietnamese people's taste is quite salty. Salt and fish sauce are familiar everyday spices... Eating a lot of salt (NaCl), the body has to increase the excretion of Na+, increasing Ca++ in the kidney tubules... Therefore, Calcium stones easily form.; High-protein diet: Protein in food increases urine pH levels, increases Calcium excretion and reduces Citrate absorption.; Taking Calcium and Vitamin C supplements incorrectly: We supplement too much with micronutrients, leading to an excess of them in the body. For Vitamin C, when converted into Oxalate radical. Ca++ ions will compete and inhibit the absorption of other ions such as Ze++, Fe++, etc. When the kidneys have too many substances, they will be overloaded, of course increasing the risk of stone formation here.; Consequences of gastrointestinal diseases such as stomach ulcers, diarrhea... can also form Calcium Oxalate stones. Diarrhea causes dehydration, loss of Na+ K+ ions, etc. decreased urine output; Oxalate concentration in urine increases,... thereby easily forming stones; Genetic factors: The disease can also be caused by genes in the family. The risk of disease in members of the same bloodline is higher than normal.; In people born or acquired, there are urinary tract malformations, causing urinary tract obstruction, for example due to prostate enlargement, diverticula in the bladder, prostate fibroids, etc. Some patients are injured and cannot move for a long time. Urinary tract obstruction causes urine, which is stored for a long time, to deposit and form kidney stones.; Urinary tract infections. Bacteria penetrate, causing persistent urinary tract infections, creating pus, and depositing excretions over a long period of time, which also causes kidney stones; Obesity: According to some studies, the risk of disease for obese people is higher than that of normal people.",
