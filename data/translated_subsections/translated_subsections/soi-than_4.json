    "subsection_content": "When stones get stuck inside the urinary tract, it will affect the urinary tract through 3 stages:\nOpposition phase\nAt this stage, the upper part of the urinary tract that is stuck with a stone will increase contractions to push the stone out. The ureters and the upper renal pelvis are not dilated. There is a sudden increase in pressure in the renal pelvis causing renal colic. Clinically, at this stage, patients often present with typical kidney storm pain.\nExpansion phase\nThis stage is a consequence of the resistance stage. After about 3 months without being able to push the stone out, the ureter, renal pelvis and renal calyces above the blockage site will dilate. Ureteral motility is reduced\nComplications stage\nThe stone does not move for a long time due to its adhesion to the mucosa. The ureters are thickened and can become narrowed. During this stage, kidney function will gradually decline. Kidneys have fluid retention. And if there is an infection, there will also be pus stasis.\nStones remain in the urinary tract, which is a favorable factor for reinfection. If left for a long time, it will cause chronic pyelonephritis and lead to chronic kidney failure.",
