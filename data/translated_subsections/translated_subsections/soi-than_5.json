That is:\nSupersonic\nWhen kidney stones are suspected, the first diagnostic method prescribed is ultrasound, because it is quite effective, simple and less expensive. Using an ultrasound, the doctor can detect stones, and can also predict the degree of fluid retention in the kidneys, ureters and the thickness of the kidney tissue.\nSome cases of stones without obvious complications or symptoms have been discovered during incidental ultrasound examinations for some other reason or during routine general examinations.\nUrine test\nThis is a mandatory test in diagnosing kidney stones. Because from the results of this test, many conclusions can be drawn about the disease condition - stages and complications, especially Urinary Tract Infection.\nExamine the sediment\nOxalate crystals, phosphate, calcium... These are the components of kidney stones. It can be concluded what type of stone exists and is forming in the urinary system.\nUrine pH\nBacteria will decompose Urea into Ammonia, so when the pH level is > 6.5, it can be concluded that it is a urinary tract infection.\nProteinuria\nIf there is a lot of proteinuria, the doctor will have to diagnose glomerular diseases because if there is only urinary tract infection, there will be very little proteinuria in the urine.\nFind cells and germs\nUrine test found many red and white blood cells. If kidney stones are suspected to be complicated by infection, when centrifuged, examined and Gram-stained, bacteria can be seen in the urine.\nASP – Abdominal X-ray without preparation\nMost urinary system stones in Vietnam are radiopaque stones, so X-rays are very valuable in diagnosis. This method helps the doctor determine the location of radiopaque stones, indicating the size, number and shape of the stones.\nUIV – Intravenous urography\nUIV scan shows the shape of the kidneys, renal pelvis, and ureters; location of the stone in the urinary tract; Degree of dilatation of the renal pelvis and ureters. Through this, it is possible to determine the contrast excretion function of each kidney.\nX-ray of the upstream and downstream kidneys\nThis is a measure to detect non-opaque stones, it is valuable in cases of silent kidneys on UIV film\nCystoscopy\nThis method is rarely used for diagnosis and is mainly used in laparoscopic surgery to remove stones",
