In some cases where it is ineffective, the doctor will consider using Morphine.; Smooth muscle relaxants: intravenous injection of Buscopan, Drotaverin,...; Antibiotics: if there are signs of infection, commonly used antibiotics that are effective on gram-negative bacteria such as 3rd generation Cephalosporins, Quinolones and Aminosides. If the patient has kidney failure, depending on the level of kidney failure, change the dosage and avoid using Aminoside; Treat the cause of ureteral obstruction (stones, urinary tract malformations causing fluid retention). When medical treatment is ineffective for renal colic, doctors will prescribe early surgery to resolve the blockage. Depending on the patient's condition, number and size of stones; kidney function status on each side... the doctor will decide on minimal percutaneous drainage of the renal pelvis, or emergency surgery.\n* Note that treating stones with internal medicine\nFor small and smooth stones: Urine flow can be increased with diuretics and drinking plenty of water,... stones can be expelled naturally through ureteral peristalsis. Use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to prevent the ureteral mucosa from becoming edematous and avoid obstructing the path of stones; For uric acid stones - non-opaque stones: common in developed countries. This stone crystallizes in urine pH < 6 and can dissolve upon alkalinization. Therefore, this type of stone can be treated by: Having the patient drink more than 2 liters of water a day, abstaining from alcohol and stimulants. Diet needs to reduce protein intake. Alkalize urine with Bicarbonate de Sodium 5 -10g/day. Inhibit purine with Allopurinol 100-300mg/day. Note that it may cause side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, itching, skin rash, and impaired liver function. You should take the medicine after eating; Have the patient drink plenty of water, over 2 liters of water per day, and abstain from alcohol and stimulants. Diet needs to reduce protein intake.; Alkalize urine with Bicarbonate de Sodium 5 -10g/day. Inhibit purine with Allopurinol 100-300mg/day. Note that it may cause side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, itching, skin rash, and impaired liver function. You should take the medicine after eating.\nMedical treatment after stone removal surgery\nPatients should note that treating kidney stones does not mean that they will completely prevent recurrence. Because it is likely that there will continue to be the following risks:\nAfter surgery, stones were still left behind.; The urinary tract still has narrow areas, so the urinary system continues to deposit sediment and crystallize to form stones.; The urinary tract remains infected. Urinary tract infection is one of the causes of kidney stones, so it is necessary to completely treat urinary tract infection. Ideally, urinary infections should be treated according to the antibiogram to achieve complete results.\nSurgical treatment\nNeither the patient nor the doctor can completely decide on the treatment method for kidney stones, but the stone itself, its location and the stage of the disease will determine the appropriate kidney stone surgery method to get the right result. Best results, cost savings.\nWhen the stone has fallen into the ureter near the bladder, a semi-rigid endoscope and laser can be used to pull it out.; When the stone is high, flexible endoscopy can be used. The doctor will use a flexible tube to pass up through the urethra to reach the stone.; When the stone is in the middle kidney, use a percutaneous lithotripsy machine and make a small hole in the kidney to break the stone. In the percutaneous stone removal method, the stone is directly removed. If the stone is only 1cm, the doctor can dissolve the stone outside the body, which is less invasive, does not require hospitalization, and is cheaper.\nPreventive treatment\nPatients should drink lots of water and exercise regularly, jumping rope is a very good choice. Because kidney stones often stick to the kidney lining, when exercising (especially jumping rope) they can come loose and increase the chance of self-elimination, especially lower calyx stones. (5)\nFor kidney stone patients, you must drink plenty of water to ensure urine output is more than 2 liters per day. If you work in a hot environment or play a lot of sports, you must compensate for lost water.\nTo know how much water is enough to drink, you can use the formula:\nWeight x 40 = Number of water (cc) needed to drink during the day\n(For example, a 50kg person, the amount of water they need to drink is: 50 x 40 = 2,000 cc, or 2 liters of water; Similarly, a 60kg person will need to drink 2,400 cc)\nIt is important to urinate enough and the urine must be clear. If you see yellow urine, check to see if you are drinking enough water. Every day you have to check yourself to see when clear white urine is enough.\nIf calcium content is idiopathic: maintain a diet with normal salt (6 - 9 g NaCl/day) and normal protein (1.2 g/kg/day). Especially limit calcium intake to 800 - 1000 mg/day; Uric Stones:  Diet reduces intake of purine-containing substances). Alkalize urine to 6.5 < urinary pH < 7 to avoid calcium and phosphorus crystal deposition; Stones due to infection: after surgery to remove stones, continue taking antibiotics for about 2-3 months. Choose antibiotics that concentrate well on the kidney parenchyma such as Cotrimoxazole, Quinolone...; Cystin stones: Drink lots of water, 3 liters/day. Maintain urinary pH from 7.5 to 8 by taking Sodium Bicarbonate every day\nTo schedule an examination and treatment of urinary tract diseases, customers can fill in information here, or contact Tam Anh General Hospital System: In Hanoi: 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Bo De Ward, District Long Bien, Hanoi.
