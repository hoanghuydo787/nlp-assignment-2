Most of them start to form in the kidneys, move along the urinary system and are excreted, so many people are familiar with the name kidney stones. In the US, every year more than 400,000 patients are hospitalized because of urolithiasis. Most patients are between 30 and 50 years old. Men have a disease rate 3 times higher than women. There are 4-5 times more white people than black people.\nStones in the urinary system are a disease that can occur throughout a patient's life, so patients must be managed, monitored and have a reasonable lifestyle to limit the recurrence of stones.",
