They are yellow and slightly friable.

The patient often rolls around, does not have a pain-relieving position, the pain is from the hip and back spreading to the front of the abdomen to the iliac fossa on the same side. Patients often have a feeling of urinary retention, frequent and painful urination, and possibly hematuria.; Bladder stones: 80% are due to stones falling from the kidney or ureter or due to obstruction in the bladder neck and urethra such as prostate enlargement, posterior urethral valve, urethral stricture... Due to different urethral pathways. This stone is common in older men, less common in women. Stones cause painful urination, burning urination, frequent urination, and intermittent urination; Urethral stones: stones from the bladder follow the urine stream down into the urethra and get stuck and cannot be urinated. Stones cause acute urinary retention, making the patient extremely uncomfortable and may have urethral bleeding.",
