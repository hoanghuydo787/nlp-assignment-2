Currently, there is no clear unified theory  about the causes of stone formation. Some possible causes include:\n1. Increased excretion of solutes into the urine\nIncrease Calcium\nNormally, the amount of Calcium (Ca) excreted into urine is 100 - 175 mg/day for people with a moderate Calcium diet. But if the calcium content in the urine exceeds the upper limit, the body is susceptible to an increased risk of urinary stones.\nReasons for increased urinary calcium:\nConsuming foods with too much Ca such as milk, cheese, etc. Using a lot of Vitamin D causes increased absorption of Ca from the intestines... Idiopathic Ca. Patients lie immobile for many days, causing Ca deposits. Some diseases affecting the skeletal system such as hyperparathyroidism, cancer that has metastasized to the bones , myeloma... Some other internal kidney diseases...; Consuming foods with too much Ca such as milk, cheese, etc.; Using a lot of Vitamin D causes increased absorption of Ca from the intestines...; Tieu Ca is idiopathic; The patient lies motionless for many days, causing calcium deposits; Some diseases affecting the skeletal system such as hyperparathyroidism, cancer that has metastasized to the bones, myeloma...; Some other kidney diseases...; Increased Oxalate\nAbout 50% of stones are Calcium Oxalate salt. Therefore, eating a lot of foods high in Oxalate is also a cause of stone deposition.\nHowever, the cause of increased Oxalate is mainly due to some genetic diseases causing defects in Glyoxylic acid metabolism: malabsorption disease, surgery to remove too much intestine...\nIncreased Cystine\nDue to genetic disorders, this stone is rare and does not radiopaque.\nIncreased Uric Acid\nHigh levels of Uric Acid come from consuming a lot of foods containing substances that produce Uric Acid due to absorbing too many purines such as meat, seafood, poultry... or as a result of chemotherapy for certain diseases such as leukemia, hyperthyroidism. red blood cells.\nMild hyperuricemia is defined as a concentration >800 mg/day (> 5 mmol/day) in men or >750 mg/day (> 4 mmol/day) in women. Mostly in protein (usually meat, fish and poultry, etc.); it can cause the formation of calcium oxalate stones (hyperuricemic calciumoxalate kidney stones).\n2. Changes in reason\nReduced urine flow causes the concentration of salts and organic substances to increase. Caused by hot weather, heavy work, drinking little water, etc.\nNormal urine pH index is 5.85. pH levels are changed due to the body excreting food, drinks, functional foods and pharmaceuticals... through the urinary system.
