If kidney function decreases, it will cause anemia.; Urine test: may find blood, protein, pus cells or bacteria. And there may be crystals similar to the chemical composition of stones. If pH > 7.6: infection with urea-decomposing bacteria (like Protéus), stones are usually Magnesium Ammonium Phosphate. If the pH is always 6.5: the cause is acidosis due to renal tubular disease. If the pH is always low, it is easy to diagnose Urate stones.; If pH > 7.6: urea-degrading bacterial infection (like Protéus), stones are usually Magnesium Ammonium Phosphate.; If pH is always 6.5: the cause is acidosis due to renal tubular disease; If pH is always low, it is easy to diagnose Urate stones; Blood biochemistry: Blood concentrations of substances in the chemical composition of stones can find the medical cause of stones and treat the root of stone disease. For example, blood Calcium often increases in hyperparathyroidism, osteolytic diseases, and diffuse cancers such as breast cancer, lung cancer, leukemia...; Ultrasound: is a simple test, cheap, easy to perform, less invasive but has a high sensitivity of 95%. Assess whether there are kidney stones or not, whether the kidneys have hydronephrosis or not, and the remaining thickness of the kidney parenchyma.; X-ray:         KUB is an unprepared X-ray of the urinary system, 90% of stones are visible on the film (opaque stones). This is the most basic test to evaluate, showing whether or not stones are present, shape, size.

This is the most basic test to evaluate, showing whether or not stones are present, shape, size, quantity. , gravel location.; UIV: further shows the degree of hydronephrosis of the kidneys, and the excretory function of both kidneys; CT-Scan of the abdomen: diagnoses stones with almost 100% accuracy. In addition, it can distinguish other lesions from stones such as: tumors of the urinary system, malformations of the urinary system as well as other organs in the abdomen. ; Cystoscopy: helps detect bladder stones and associated diseases in the bladder and urethra.",
