    "subsection_content": "Urinary incontinence is classified into many different types based on symptoms and causes, specifically: (2)\nUrinary incontinence is related to intra-abdominal pressure (increased pressure on the bladder) causing the patient to leak urine when coughing, sneezing, choking on laughter, heavy lifting or vigorous physical activity. This phenomenon occurs due to weakened pelvic floor organs (pelvic floor disorder), commonly seen in women after giving birth or after total hysterectomy.; Urgent urination occurs when the patient has a sudden urge to urinate and leaks urine without getting to the toilet in time. This phenomenon is common in older people, sometimes related to urinary tract infections. In some cases, urinary urgency is related to certain neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury.; Urinary incontinence due to a full bladder causes the patient to always be in a state of urine leakage, unable to completely eliminate urine when going to the toilet. This phenomenon is more common in men, especially those with tumors, enlarged prostates, kidney stones, diabetes or using certain medications.; Urinary control dysfunction occurs in patients with physical or mental disabilities, which hinders timely urination. For example, someone with arthritis may have difficulty unbuttoning their pants, or someone with Alzheimer's may have difficulty planning their trip to the bathroom.; Mixed urinary incontinence is a condition in which a patient has more than one type of urinary incontinence, usually a combination of bladder pressure and urinary incontinence.; Transient urinary incontinence is a condition in which a patient leaks a little urine for a short period of time due to a urinary tract infection or is using a new medication. After these causes are eliminated, urinary incontinence will also disappear.; Bedwetting is a phenomenon of urine leakage during sleep, common in children but adults can also suffer from it. Bedwetting is not considered a health problem, however if this phenomenon occurs frequently when a child is over 5 years old, parents should have the child examined early to find the cause.",
