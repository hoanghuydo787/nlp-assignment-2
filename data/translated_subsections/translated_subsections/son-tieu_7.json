This device is used in people with cystocele, uterine prolapse, or urethral hypermobility (often associated with urethral prolapse) leading to urinary incontinence under pressure.\nSurgical treatment\nWhen the above methods are not effective, the doctor may prescribe the patient to undergo surgery to treat urinary incontinence.\nIn women, pregnancy and childbirth can cause pelvic floor muscles to become weak and damaged. The support component below the urethra cannot keep the urethra and bladder in their normal position, leading to postpartum women being susceptible to urinary incontinence during exertion.\nTo improve this condition, the doctor will place an insoluble lifting tape under the middle of the urethra through the vagina, creating a solid support layer, hanging the urethra and bladder back to their normal position.\nSurgical treatment of urinary incontinence is a method indicated after other methods are ineffective",
