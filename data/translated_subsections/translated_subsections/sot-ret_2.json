In Vietnam alone, there are 3 types: P. falciparum, P.vivax and P.malariae. These parasites transmit the disease through an intermediate host, the Anopheles mosquito. (2)\nThere are about 422 species of Anopheles mosquitoes in the world, but in reality only about 70 species of mosquitoes can transmit the parasite that causes malaria, of which 40 species of mosquitoes are the intermediate hosts of the disease. In Vietnam, there are 15 species of Anopheles mosquitoes that cause disease, including 3 species that regularly transmit the disease: An.dirus, An.minimus, An.epiroticus and 12 additional disease-transmitting species: An.aconitus, An.jeyporensis, An. maculatus, An.sinensis, An.campestri, An.subpictus, An.vagus, An.indefinitus.\nAn.dirus mosquitoes thrive in the rainy season, distributed mainly in mountainous areas from 20 latitude North to South. The An.epiroticus mosquito lives in the brackish coastal waters of the South. An.minimus mosquitoes are distributed in mountainous and hilly areas below 1,000 meters, thriving at the beginning and end of the rainy season.\nWhen a mosquito bites and sucks the blood of a person with malaria, it sucks in the male and female gametocytes of the malaria parasite. The time from the first fever to the appearance of gametocytes in the blood ranges from 2-3 days for P.vivax, P.malariae, P.ovale, from 7-10 days for P.falciparum.\nIn the mosquito's body, male and female gametocytes combine to form ovules, then pass through the stomach wall and form cocoons, which develop into thousands of young parasites. Young parasites move up towards the mosquito's salivary glands and gather here to have the opportunity to penetrate other people. When the parasite enters the bloodstream, it will reach the liver, develop in liver cells through stages from trophozoites to schizonts, and rupture the liver cells, releasing young parasites into the blood. In the blood vessels, young parasites penetrate young red blood cells, breaking them down to release young parasites that cause malaria. Young parasites have two forms: the asexual form returns to invade red blood cells to develop, and the sexual form includes male and female gametocytes. The gametocytes do not penetrate red blood cells but wait for the mosquito to suck the patient's blood to return to a new life cycle.\nIn some situations, P.vivax and P.ovale parasites can \"temporarily reside long-term\" in the liver, which is the reason why signs of fever recur after many months, even lasting up to 2-3 years. year. People with malaria are still a source of infection when gametocytes are still in the blood. Some studies have noted that for people with malaria who are not treated or are not treated thoroughly, gametocytes in the blood can still be a source of infection when bitten by mosquitoes to others, specifically for over 3 years for malaria. survival of P.malariae, 2 years for P.vivax and 1 year for P.falciparum.\nMosquitoes are the main agent that transmits malaria",
