Blood from an infected person can transmit malaria for at least 1 month. Malaria is transmitted through blood with 4 modes of transmission:\nMosquito transmission: This is the main way malaria spreads.; Blood transfusion: In some rare cases, blood donors (healthy carriers of the disease) are infected with malaria parasites but do not know it and donate blood to others.; Mother to child: Pregnant women with malaria will transmit it to their child through the placenta and face the risk of miscarriage and premature birth. The cause is due to the mother's anemia, severe illness, hypoglycemia, and acute pulmonary edema. Luckily, the rate of pregnant women getting malaria is very rare.; Injection: Syringe contaminated with blood containing malaria parasites, due to injecting drugs with a person carrying the disease.",
