    "subsection_content": "Common malaria\nCommon malaria is the initial symptoms of malaria, without complications, so it is usually not dangerous to the patient's life. Depending on the type of parasite causing the disease, the fever cycle in common malaria will be different. For example, malaria caused by P.falciparum causes the patient to have a fever every day. The fever is often severe and can easily lead to malignant malaria and death if not treated promptly. If malaria is transmitted by the P.vivax parasite, the fever usually occurs every other day. Fever caused by P.malariae and P.ovale parasites can occur every other day but sometimes only occurs once every 3 days. In general, common malaria includes 3 types: primary fever, typical fever and truncated fever. (3)\nInitial fever: The first fever is often not typical, the patient will have a high fever continuously for several days. The next time you have a fever, the symptoms of malaria will be more typical.; Typical fever: The patient goes through three stages of chills - fever - sweating. Chills phase: This phase lasts 30 minutes - 2 hours, the patient has chills all over the body, pale lips, haloed eyes, and goosebumps. Hot fever stage: Lasts from 1 to 3 hours. When the chills begin to subside, the patient feels hotter, body temperature can reach 40 degrees Celsius - 41 degrees Celsius. The patient's face is red, skin is dry and hot, pulse is rapid, breathing is short, thirst is accompanied by thirst. Headache, possibly some pain in the liver and spleen area. Sweating phase: Body temperature drops rapidly, the patient begins to sweat and continues to feel thirsty. The patient's headache is relieved, his pulse returns to normal, he feels comfortable, and falls asleep.; Chills phase: This phase lasts 30 minutes - 2 hours, the patient has chills all over the body, pale lips, haloed eyes, goosebumps.; Hot fever stage: Lasts from 1 to 3 hours. When the chills begin to subside, the patient feels hotter, body temperature can reach 40 degrees Celsius - 41 degrees Celsius. The patient's face is red, skin is dry and hot, pulse is rapid, breathing is short, thirst is accompanied by thirst. headache, possibly slight pain in the liver and spleen area; Sweating phase: Body temperature drops rapidly, the patient begins to sweat and continues to feel thirsty. The patient's headache is relieved, his pulse returns to normal, he feels comfortable, and falls asleep.; Short-term fever: Lasts about 1-2 hours, the patient does not have a fever, only feels chills.\nIn addition, there are some other forms of malaria such as healthy people carrying the parasite (cold parasitic form), results: blood test shows malaria parasites but the patient does not have a fever, can still live and work normally. .\nMalignant malaria\nSevere malaria is a severe form of malaria with complications. Patients have prominent signs of neurological disorders such as behavioral disorders, consciousness disorders, rapid, sometimes sudden coma, sometimes convulsions, paralysis, loss of cortex, loss of brain. There are many different forms of malignant malaria.\nCerebral form: Accounts for 80% - 95% of complicated malaria cases. The patient has pre-malignant signs, the most typical being consciousness disorders such as drowsiness or restlessness, and babbling. The patient also has continuous high fever, severe headache, insomnia, vomiting or diarrhea. In the brain, there are also signs of psychiatric syndromes such as sudden or gradual coma, gradually deepening coma, dilated pupils, epileptic seizures, and sphincter disorders. In addition, the patient also shows other signs such as respiratory disorders or respiratory failure due to brain edema, phlegm stagnation, brain dehydration or swelling leading to decreased or increased blood pressure, vomiting, and diarrhea. In some cases, kidney failure occurs, little or no urine, increased urea levels in the blood, and blood in the urine. The number of patients who die from cerebral malaria ranges from 20% - 50%.; Hemoglobinuria: The disease progresses seriously due to massive hemolysis, the patient has a severe fever, feels like vomiting or vomits yellow fluid, jaundice, cardiovascular collapse, kidney failure, back pain. The patient urinates hemoglobin. The urine is initially red-brown and then turns coffee-colored. With subsequent urination, the amount of urine gradually decreases and there is even no urine. Patients suffer from anemia, acute lack of oxygen, and the amount of red blood cells and hemoglobin in the blood drops sharply.; Cold form: The patient has low blood pressure, sweats a lot, the whole body becomes cold, the skin turns pale, and has a headache.; Pulmonary type: The bottom of the lungs has many moist rales and snoring rales, causing the patient to have difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, cyanosis, and in some cases even spitting out pink foam.; Hepatobiliary form: Patients with yellow eyes, jaundice, yellow stools and urine, nausea and vomiting, coma.; Digestive: Patients have abdominal pain, vomiting, acute diarrhea, hypothermia.",
