    "subsection_content": "Among the parasites that cause malaria, the most feared is plasmodium, which easily causes patients to fall into malignant malaria. Some other types of malaria parasites cause milder forms of the disease, but can still persist for many years and cause relapses. The World Health Organization estimates that about 94% of all malaria deaths occur in Africa, mainly in children under 5 years old. There are many dangerous and serious complications of malaria such as: (4)\nCerebral malaria: Small blood vessels cannot circulate to the brain because blood cells filled with parasites are clogged, leading to cerebral edema and brain damage. The patient shows signs of convulsions and coma. Particularly, children are susceptible to blood loss and brain damage, facing the risk of neurological and cognitive impairment, behavioral disorders, and epilepsy.; Pulmonary edema: The patient's body accumulates secretions, causing pulmonary edema, difficulty breathing, and easily leading to death.; Organ failure: Kidney failure, liver failure or spleen rupture puts the body in critical condition.; Anemia: The body does not have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to the body's tissues.; Hypoglycemia: Patients face coma or even death because hypoglycemia occurs. Patients with hypoglycemia are not only caused by the disease but also by side effects of the drug quinine to treat malaria.\nSevere malaria can progress very quickly and lead to death within hours to days. In most severe cases, the mortality rate can be up to 20% and requires special care and treatment. Although the disease is dangerous, if treated properly, the patient will recover well.",
