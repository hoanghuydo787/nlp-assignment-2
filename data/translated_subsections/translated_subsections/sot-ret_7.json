Therefore, the most accurate diagnosis is a blood test to distinguish malaria from other diseases.\nTesting methods:\nGiemsa stain: Considered the gold standard for identifying malaria parasites. Giemsa-stained blood smears were examined under a light microscope.; Quick AO staining: The patient's blood sample is examined under a fluorescence microscope; QBC method of fluorescence microscopy.; Rapid test based on immunochromatography method to detect malaria parasite antigens present in the blood.; PCR molecular biology: High sensitivity and specificity, can detect parasites/mm3 of blood, even helps diagnose recurrent malaria or reinfection of malaria.; Detection of malaria antibodies: Indirect fluorescence method and immunosorbent fermentation binding method both detect antibodies in the serum of malaria patients.",
