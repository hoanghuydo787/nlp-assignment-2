As for treatment, the patient is killed with gametocytes to stop the malaria attack combined with preventing its spread; At the same time, it kills P.vivax and dormant P.ovale parasites in the liver.\nFor people with common malaria\nTreatment to relieve malaria:\nP.vivax parasitic infection: Patients are given chloroquin at a total dose of 25 mg/kg body weight. Patients receive it for 3 days of treatment. The first two days, the patient takes 10 mg/kg of body weight/day, and on the third day, takes 5 mg/kg of body weight. Or treat with artesunate at a total dose of 16 mg/kg of body weight divided into 7 days. On the first day, the patient takes 4 mg/kg of body weight, from days 2 to 7, the patient takes 2 mg/kg of body weight every day. Artesunate should not be used in pregnant women during the first 3 months, unless they have severe malaria. Or patients can be treated with quinine sulfate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/24 hours divided into 3 doses a day, treatment lasting 7 days.\nP.falciparum parasitic infection: Patients are given drugs containing artemisinin derivatives, in pill form 40 mg dihydroartemisinin + 320 mg piperaquine phosphate. For children under 3 years old, take 1 pill the first day, half a pill each day for the next two days. From 3 - under 8 years old, 2 pills the first day, 1 pill each day for the next two days. Children 8 to under 15 years old, take 3 pills the first day, 1.5 pills each day for the next two days. From 15 years old and up, take 4 pills the first day, then 2 pills/day two days later. Do not use for pregnant women in the first 3 months.\nAnti-relapse and anti-spread treatment\nPatients were given primaquine tablets with a content of 13.2 mg containing 7.5 mg of base, a dose of 0.5 mg of base/kg of body weight/24 hours.\nWith P.falciparum parasites, treatment is only required for 1 day, and for P.vivax, treatment is required for 10 consecutive days. Do not use this medicine for children under 3 years old, pregnant women, people with liver disease and G6PD deficiency.\nIn areas where P.falciparum parasites predominate, it is recommended that patients be treated to relieve fever with combination drugs containing artemisinin derivatives: Arterakine, CV artecan, coartem,...\nTreatment of patients with complicated malaria\nWhen arriving at the hospital, the patient is given artesunate intravenously, with a dose of 2.4 mg/kg of body weight in the first hour, followed by a booster injection of 1.2 mg/kg of body weight 24 hours later. Finally, each day the patient continues to receive a dose of 1.2 mg/kg of body weight until they can drink, then switch to oral medication for another 7 days.",
