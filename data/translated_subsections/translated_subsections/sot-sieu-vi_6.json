Unlike bacterial infections, antibiotics have no effect on viral infections – unless you get a secondary infection while having a viral fever. (4)\nTreatment of viral fever depends on the underlying cause of the disease, the level of fever and other accompanying symptoms. At milder fever levels, treatments may include:\nUsing over-the-counter medications: Ibuprofen and acetaminophen are non-prescription medications that people with viral fever can use. Aspirin can also help reduce your fever but should not be used by people under 18 years old. Note, in cases of dengue fever, only use acetaminophen to reduce fever.; Warm bath: Helps soothe a feverish body; Drink plenty of water: Supplementing your daily water intake or electrolytes both helps lower body temperature and prevents dehydration due to fever.\nWhat you should not do when you have fever in general and viral fever in particular is applying cold compresses or soaking in cold water to reduce fever. This is the mistake of many people. In fact, when the body temperature is high, exposure to low-temperature water not only has no effect on reducing fever but can also have a negative effect on the body. Instead, it is better for the patient to take a warm bath.\nPeople with viral fever should spend more time resting and drinking more water",
