    "subsection_content": "Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a common disease in tropical climates caused by the Dengue virus (dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF or Dengue Fever). This virus has 4 serotypes including: DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, DEN-4. Patients can be infected with 1 to 4 strains of the virus and have lifelong immunity to that strain. This does not mean that people who have had dengue fever are immune to the remaining 3 strains. Therefore, a person may have dengue fever more than once. Dengue virus is spread to humans mainly by female mosquitoes of the genus Aedes, mainly Aedes aegypti.\nDengue fever occurs all year round and peaks during the rainy season, the mosquito breeding season. Dengue fever occurs in both adults and children. The disease causes high fever, fatigue, bone pain, blood clotting disorders, hemorrhage, and sudden drop in blood pressure. In some cases, it can lead to serious changes that can negatively affect your health.\nWhen suffering from dengue fever, the patient needs proper care and regular symptom monitoring. If not diagnosed and treated promptly, the patient can become seriously ill and even die.",
