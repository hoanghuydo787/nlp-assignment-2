    "subsection_content": "The causative agent of dengue fever is the Dengue virus transmitted to humans from female Aedes mosquitoes that carry the virus that causes the disease. Dengue virus has 4 serotypes: DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, DEN-4. In Vietnam, there are all 4 serotypes. For example, after having dengue fever DEN-1, you can still get dengue fever DEN-2.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the cause of the spread of dengue fever is mainly due to female mosquitoes of the genus Aedes, commonly known as midges. The Aedes aegypti female mosquito originates from Africa, gradually spreading to other areas via boats and planes. Female Aedes aegypti formosus mosquitoes live mainly in urban areas while female Aedes albopictus mosquitoes live mainly in rural areas. (3)\nThis species transmits the disease through a bite. The saliva of the strain containing the Dengue virus will enter the patient's bloodstream, causing dengue fever. More dangerously, when the female Aedes aegypti mosquito carries a Dengue virus, it can incubate in the body for 8 - 11 days. When this virus attacks the human body, it will \"travel\" in the blood for 2 to 7 days. The process of transmitting the virus from mosquitoes to humans and then from patients to mosquitoes follows a cycle that causes dengue outbreaks to become faster. The time when mosquitoes are most active in biting and sucking human blood is early in the morning or late in the evening.\nIn addition to the source of infection from humans, health organizations also discovered that monkeys living in Malaysia carry the Dengue virus.\nSee more: Dengue fever in adults: Symptoms, diagnosis and treatment.",
