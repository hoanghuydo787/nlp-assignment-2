    "subsection_content": "If you have severe dengue fever, if you do not receive proper care, it will cause complications that will negatively affect your health and even cause death. Complications caused by dengue fever that patients may face:\nShock due to blood loss or plasma leakage, prolonged condition can cause cerebral edema and neurological syndromes leading to coma.; Respiratory tract inflammation, pneumonia or pulmonary edema due to plasma leakage causing plasma spillage into the respiratory tract.; Cerebral hemorrhage due to blood loss and plasma leakage leads to a sudden drop in blood pressure; Heart failure, kidney failure: Hemorrhage causes blood to flow continuously, causing the heart to not have enough circulation, plus the escape of plasma, causing fluid to accumulate in the pericardium. At the same time, the kidneys must work at full capacity to excrete plasma. If this condition persists, it can lead to acute kidney failure.; Sudden blindness due to retinal hemorrhage causes reduced vision or causes hemorrhage in the vitreous fluid, making the patient almost blind.; Complications in pregnant women: Pregnant women with dengue fever may have high fever and rapid fetal heart beat. If the patient becomes seriously ill, there is a risk of thrombocytopenia leading to bleeding. If you have dengue fever in the first months of pregnancy, there is a risk of threatening the fetus.\nSee more: Dengue fever in infants: Causes and diagnosis",
