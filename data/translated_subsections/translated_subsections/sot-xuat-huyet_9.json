You can take effective mosquito control measures below:\nPrevent mosquito breeding: Cover water containers tightly to prevent mosquitoes from laying eggs. Drop whole or worms into large containers of water to kill larvae. Clean small water containers regularly such as: buckets, basins, jars, jars, etc. Clear dense gardens and collect waste items that can contain water and easily contain larvae such as bottles, jars, bottle fragments, cans, coconut shells, flower offering vases, discarded wheels, etc.; Prevent mosquito bites by: Wearing long-sleeved clothes when going out, sleeping under mosquito nets even during the day. Repell mosquitoes from entering the house with mosquito spray, mosquito incense, mosquito repellent cream, catch mosquitoes with an electric mosquito racket, etc. Use door curtains impregnated with mosquito-killing chemicals. Coordinate with the authorities to spray enough mosquito-killing chemicals; Prevent the spread of epidemics from sick people: Do not let dengue patients get bitten by mosquitoes by letting them sleep under mosquito nets.\nDengue fever can occur all year round, not just during the rainy season, so people should not be subjective. Cases of dengue fever, if detected and treated promptly, will soon recover and regain health. Detecting the signs of dengue fever early and getting the right treatment will help reduce the risk of serious complications.",
