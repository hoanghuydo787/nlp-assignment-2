    "subsection_content": "Genital warts in women are the result of infection with the HPV virus - a sexually transmitted infection (STI). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HPV is a common cause of sexually transmitted infections in the United States, affecting approximately 79 million people, primarily those under 30 years of age. About 14 million new HPV infections are detected each year. (2)\nDoctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that genital warts in women can be transmitted through many different ways, specifically:\n1. Infection through sexual contact\nThis is the most common way of transmitting genital warts in women. HPV can be transmitted during unprotected sex, and can even be transmitted when the penis in men does not penetrate deep into the vagina in women.\nWomen can get genital warts if they have skin-to-skin contact, or have oral or anal sex with an infected husband/partner.\nGenital warts in women are transmitted mainly through unsafe sex\n2. Infection from mother to child\nPregnant women with genital warts need to be actively treated before giving birth, because this virus can enter the newborn's respiratory tract from the mother's genital tract, causing death. Genital warts can cause pregnant women to face the risk of cancer of the cervix, vagina, vulva, and anus; life-threatening bleeding that is difficult to control; risk of cesarean section; risk of transmitting disease from mother to child during childbirth. Therefore, it is very important to treat pregnant women before giving birth to help pregnant women avoid these dangers.\nPregnant mothers with genital warts can transmit the disease to their babies during vaginal birth. In addition, after birth, if the baby comes into contact with rough spots on the mother's body, there is also a risk of transmitting the disease to the body. Infants infected with HPV from their mothers can be fatal.\n3. Infection through open wounds\nWhen having skin-to-skin contact with someone who has genital warts and unfortunately has an open wound, it is likely that women will be infected. Mucus, pus and blood will be the causative agents, transmitting the virus directly from sick people to non-sick people.\n4. Infection due to using shared utensils\nWomen have the habit of sharing each other's belongings such as clothes, towels, shoes... without knowing that there is a risk of infection if the other person gets sick.\nDoctor Nguyen Duc Hinh added that genital warts are different from warts that appear on the hands, feet or other parts of the body. However, women can still get genital warts if they touch warts in other places with their hands and then touch their private areas.",
