    "subsection_content": "The goal of treating genital warts in women is to treat symptoms. HPV virus cannot be completely cured, it still exists in the body so the possibility of recurrence is very high.\nDoctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that after treatment, how long it takes for genital warts to recur depends on the body's resistance, as well as whether women have safe sex or not. Cases with a high likelihood of disease recurrence include:\nPeople with weakened immune systems, chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, tumors or HIV infection. Pregnant mothers who have genital warts during pregnancy also have a weakened immune system, so they are susceptible to recurrence;; People who are undergoing treatment but arbitrarily stop or change treatment methods without a doctor's prescription;; The person has sex without using protection while the husband/partner is in the incubation period and has not yet detected symptoms;; People with gynecological infections such as cervicitis, vaginitis or lesions around the anus create a favorable environment for the HPV virus to develop;; People who use stimulants, or are anxious or stressed also put the disease at risk of recurrence.\nSafe and faithful sex is the leading method to prevent the risk of genital warts in women.\nTherefore, to prevent genital warts from recurring, women need to fully comply with the doctor's treatment regimen. In addition, during treatment, women need to perform additional tests to screen for the risk of other sexually transmitted diseases.\nWomen need to have safe sex, be faithful to only one husband or partner, and not have sex promiscuously. Do not use underwear, towels, or bathtubs together; Clean the genitals every day.\nAfter treatment, although symptoms have decreased, the HPV virus still exists. Therefore, women should keep their private areas clean, use medication and follow the scheduled follow-up visits. If you have sex, you must use condoms to avoid the risk of transmitting diseases to your husband/partner.",
