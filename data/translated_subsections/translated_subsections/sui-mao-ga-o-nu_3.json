    "subsection_content": "Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that based on the development and spread of warts, genital warts in women are divided into 5 stages as follows:\n1. Incubation period\nThe incubation period is calculated from the time the HPV virus enters the body and causes the first warts to appear. The incubation period will be different for each person, it can be 2 months or it can last longer than about 9 months, usually about 3 months.\nAt this stage, the symptoms are not clear and have not progressed into disease, so it is difficult for women to recognize and treat.\n2. Onset phase\nIt can be understood that this is the first stage of the disease. At this time, women may see genital warts appear on the lips or inside the vagina, anus or rough spots in the cervix.\n3. Development stage\nThis is the stage when the disease becomes more severe, the symptoms are more obvious with genital warts that are large, dense, shaped like a chicken's comb or a cauliflower.\n4. Stage of complications\nThis can be called the final stage of the disease. At this time, the risk of infection and ulceration can occur because the genital warts rupture, causing bleeding, pus, and a foul odor. If not treated promptly and effectively, the female genital organs are at high risk of infection, leading to dangerous complications such as vaginitis, cervicitis...\n5. Recurrence stage\nAfter treatment, women are still at risk of getting genital warts again if their husband/partner is still infected or the woman still has the disease-causing virus in her body and has not been thoroughly treated. However, special attention should be paid because if genital warts in women recur, the course will be more severe and dangerous than the first time the disease occurs.\nSee more: Are genital warts in the early stages dangerous?
