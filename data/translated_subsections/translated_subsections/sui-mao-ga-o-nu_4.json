    "subsection_content": "As shared above, the incubation period for genital warts in women will be different for each person. The incubation period can last as long as 2 months or as long as 9 months, but is usually 3 months.\nDoctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that the reason the incubation period is different is due to each person's physical condition as well as the cause of the disease. If women have poor resistance, the incubation period may be faster than normal. When the virus attacks, after 2-3 weeks, there may be signs of the disease. For people with better resistance, this incubation period will be longer.\nA humid vaginal environment creates favorable conditions for the HPV virus to multiply and develop strongly, causing genital warts in women to incubate faster than in men.\n“The incubation period for genital warts in women and men is also completely different. The reason is that the female genital organ, the vagina, is moist, which is an extremely favorable environment for the HPV virus to attack and develop quickly. Therefore, if they have the same disease, the incubation period and symptoms will appear earlier in women than in men,\" Dr. Nguyen Duc Hinh added.",
