    "subsection_content": "Genital warts in women are one of the dangerous diseases because of their ability to transmit quickly, making women feel pain, guilt, low self-esteem... If not detected early and treated promptly, the disease can Severe progression causes many serious complications, affecting women's health and fertility. Detail:\n1. Risk of cervical cancer\nThere are more than 100 different strains of HPV that can cause genital warts, but not all are cancerous. However, if women are infected with many strains of HPV at the same time, at least 14 types, they are at risk of causing cervical cancer. (3)\nStatistics show that about 10.2% of women with genital warts in the cervix, 5% of genital warts in the vagina and 5% of genital warts in the anus can develop into cancer.\nIn addition, women are also at risk of nasopharyngeal cancer, throat cancer... if they contract genital warts due to unsafe oral sex.\n2. Affects fertility\nIf your husband/partner has genital warts, there is a high risk of penis deformity causing urethral blockage, vas deferens blockage... affecting the ability to ejaculate in men.\nSome studies also show that HPV virus in semen can reduce sperm mobility, making it difficult for sperm to move deep into the uterus to meet the egg. In case sperm containing HPV meets the egg and fertilizes it, it also increases the risk of miscarriage.\nFear and low self-esteem when infected with the disease cause women to not seek medical attention, easily encountering many dangerous complications to their health and fertility.\n3. Effects on pregnancy\nDuring pregnancy, hormone levels in a woman's body increase, causing warts to get larger, spread more widely, and easily rub against each other, causing them to break and bleed. Genital warts not only make it difficult to urinate, but also reduce the elasticity of vaginal tissue, affecting the natural birth process, making it difficult for pregnant mothers to give birth normally through the vagina.\nChildren born to mothers with genital warts are also at risk of infection. Statistics show that, although rare, about 4/100,000 children infected with the disease after birth are at risk of developing laryngeal papilloma, causing the child to have a hoarse voice, weak cry, etc. If not treated with support, the disease will progress. Severe cases can spread to the trachea and lungs, causing airway obstruction in children.",
