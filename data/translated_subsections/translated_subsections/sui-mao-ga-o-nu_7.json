    "subsection_content": "When diagnosed, most women are confused and worried: \"Can genital warts in women be cured completely?\" Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh said that currently there is no medicine to treat HPV virus, this virus is still capable of re-infection, meaning women can still relapse after treatment. This means that women can carry the disease for life, may have symptoms or no symptoms, and are at risk of transmitting the disease to their husbands/partners if they have unprotected sex.\nDoctor Nguyen Duc Hinh recommends that when sick, women should not arbitrarily use common wart treatment drugs to treat genital warts. If treated incorrectly, it can lead to more severe and serious injuries. Instead, women should immediately go to a medical facility with a reputable Obstetrics and Gynecology specialty to receive an accurate examination, diagnosis, and guidance on the most appropriate treatment regimen.\nWhen sick, women need to immediately go to a medical facility for examination and guidance on appropriate treatment methods",
