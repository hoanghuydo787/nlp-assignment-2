    "subsection_content": "The virus that causes genital warts is Human Papillomavirus (HPV). This virus includes about 150 strains with at least 30-40 strains transmitted through sexual contact. But only certain strains can cause genital warts. According to the US National Cancer Institute, there are two common groups that cause genital warts:\nHPV-16 and HPV-18 strains belong to the high-risk group, capable of causing cancer of the cervix, penis, vulva, vagina, anus, oropharynx...; HPV-6 and HPV-11 strains belong to the benign group. However, giant genital warts (Buschke-Lowenstein tumors) are very rare and are considered a form of papillary squamous cell carcinoma caused by HPV 6 and 11. The disease is characterized by invasion below the dermis. Pathology has benign areas interspersed with abnormal epidermal cells or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) differentiated cells.",
