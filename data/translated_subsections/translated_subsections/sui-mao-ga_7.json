There is currently no data on safety for pregnant women and children under 12 years of age. The drug has the ability to enhance local immunity. However, this medicine is used on the skin and causes local inflammatory reactions such as: skin redness, irritation, calluses, ulcers, erosions, blisters and hypopigmentation...; Trichloroacetic acid: This acid is similar to acetic acid, used in cosmetic treatments, warts and genital warts. The drug can also cause side effects such as mild skin irritation, including itching, swelling, pain... Can be used by pregnant women.; Podophyllin and Podofilox: This is a type of tree resin that destroys the tissue of genital warts. However, podofilox, a compound with similar activity to Podophyllin, is not intended for use in the internal genital area and is contraindicated in pregnant women.; Interferon or 5-fluorouracin: This is an injectable drug that strengthens the body's natural resistance, thereby helping to destroy the HPV virus. However, the drug is only suitable for small, less serious injuries because it can cause many side effects and has a relatively high cost.\nGenital warts cannot be treated with regular wart medications or over-the-counter medications. Therefore, patients should not arbitrarily use medicine or buy it at a pharmacy, but should go to the hospital to check their specific condition and be prescribed appropriate medicine, to avoid complications and the risk of drug resistance.\nTreatment is by procedures and surgery\nIf medical treatment is not effective, the patient may need some minor procedures to remove the wart. Those measures include:\nCryotheraphy: This procedure uses liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees Celsius) to freeze infected cells, causing irreversible damage to cell membranes. The doctor sprays or uses a cotton swab to dab the lesion until a 1mm frozen halo appears around the lesion, photocoagulation time is 5-20 seconds, 1-2 healing cycles each time and repeat 1-3 times. /week maximum 12 weeks. Side effects of this method are pain, necrosis, blisters, and scarring. Regional anesthesia may be needed if the lesions are large or extensive. The rate of lesion clearance is 44 - 87%, recurrence is 12 - 42% after 1-3 months and can be up to 59% after 12 months of lesion clearance. Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen requires quite simple, inexpensive equipment and is safe for pregnant women. The downside is that patients need to go to the medical facility many times\nPhysical methods remove and destroy damage\nIncluding: CO2 laser, curettage, electrocautery... Priority indicated for large, widespread warts, warts in the urethra, vagina, cervix and other lesions that do not respond to treatment. CO2 laser is preferred because it maintains anatomy, controls depth, is easier to perform than surgical excision, has less bleeding, and causes less discomfort than electrocautery. Electrocautery is contraindicated for people with pacemakers and lesions near the anus.\nThe patient will receive local anesthesia during the procedure. In the case of large lesions, in the anal canal or in children, general anesthesia may be given. These methods are effective in removing most (89-100%) of the lesions at one time, however the risk of recurrence ranges from 19-29% and has disadvantages including possible scarring and pigmentation changes. , anal fissures, damage to the anal sphincter.",
