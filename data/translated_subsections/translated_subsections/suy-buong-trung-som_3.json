This condition leads to the early development of a number of diseases such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and lipid disorders.\nWomen with premature ovarian failure can still have children naturally, but in some cases they need to seek help from modern reproductive support methods such as in vitro fertilization or oocyte donation. In case women with premature ovarian failure want to have children or want to store eggs to preserve future fertility, they need to see a fertility doctor early to get advice on the most appropriate treatment regimen. (4)\nAccording to studies, a woman's ovarian reserve index will gradually decrease with age, especially after the age of 35. However, having children also depends on age factors, for example, a woman with low ovarian reserve but only aged 35 or younger will have a higher chance of having children than those over 40. year old. Currently there is no way to stop the process of ovarian failure or improve this condition. As you get older, the quality and quantity of eggs decrease, so you need to be examined early so as not to miss the golden time in treatment.\nCurrently, egg storage is considered a trend among modern women. Egg storage helps preserve fertility. Stored egg cells will \"stop the biological clock\" right at the time of storage and the rate of usable eggs after defrosting is over 95%.",
