For women, FSH stimulates oocyte development, which is part of the menstrual cycle. High FSH often appears in premenopausal, postmenopausal women, and people over the age of 40. In the case of women under 40 years old with high FSH levels above 30-40 IU/L, ovarian failure can be diagnosed. early eggs.; Estradiol test: Estradiol is a form of the hormone estrogen that is produced by the ovaries, breasts and adrenal glands. During the menstrual cycle, FSH stimulates the development of immature ovarian follicles. When the ovum develops, it secretes estradiol. The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are affected, releasing the hormones GnRH and LH to promote ovulation. .; In the case of women with premature ovarian failure, there will be a reduced response or no response to FSH stimulation, so the ovarian follicles do not develop and do not secrete estradiol, and the concentration of the hormone estradiol in the blood is lower than normal.; Chromosomal testing: The doctor may prescribe a chromosomal test to check the cause of ovarian failure.",
