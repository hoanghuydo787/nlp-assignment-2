    "subsection_content": "Acute liver failure comes from many different causes, mainly drugs and viruses. As follows:\n1. Due to viral hepatitis (hepatitis A, B, C, etc.)\nThis is the main cause of acute liver failure. Among them, the most common virus is hepatitis B, often co-infected with hepatitis D. In contrast, hepatitis C is not the main cause. In addition, some other viruses include: Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr, Herpes Simplex, Parvovirus B19, Varicella-zoster, hepatitis A (rare), hepatitis E, viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever...\nAcute liver failure due to hepatitis B virus can cause complications such as: infection, electrolyte deficiency and bleeding, etc. and other complications, if not treated promptly can lead to death.\n2. Medicines and toxins (poisonous mushrooms, industrial chemicals, etc.)\nThe most common toxin causing acute liver failure is Acetaminophen - dose-related toxicity. Acute liver failure is more likely to occur in people with liver damage caused by alcohol or using drugs that induce the Cytochrome P-450 enzyme system. In addition, some other toxins that can be mentioned include:\nAnti-tuberculosis drug: leading is Isoniazid.; Amoxicillin/Clavulanate.; Halothane.; Iron compounds.; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).; Some compounds in Amanita phalloides herbal and mushroom products.\n3. Using the wrong medicine or wrong dosage\nUsing too much Acetaminophen (or Paracetamol) is one of the most common causes of acute liver failure. The condition occurs when the body has to take a very large dose of Paracetamol or after using a higher than recommended dose every day for several days. In this case, seeking prompt medical attention is absolutely necessary to prevent liver failure.\n4. Other diseases\nAutoimmune disease: A disease that causes the body's immune system to attack liver cells, causing inflammation and damage; Metabolic diseases: Rare metabolic diseases such as Wilson's disease, acute fatty liver of pregnancy can also cause acute liver failure.; Cancer: Cancer that starts in the liver or metastasizes here also causes serious damage to the organ.; Shock: Sepsis or shock can severely impair blood flow to the liver, causing liver failure.; Heat stroke: Physical activity in hot environments can also be a risk for acute liver failure.",
