Some typical examples include: (3)\nKidney failure: Kidney failure due to liver failure is also called hepatorenal syndrome; Kidney failure: Kidney failure due to liver failure is also called hepatorenal syndrome.\nSepsis (including aspiration pneumonia and fever): This condition requires treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.; Sepsis (including aspiration pneumonia and fever): This condition requires treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.\nCerebral edema: This is one of the most common causes of death from acute liver failure. When there is cerebral edema, ischemia and herniation will occur, leading to increased intracranial pressure and traumatic brain injury. In particular, bodies with arterial ammonia concentrations higher than 200 micromoles/liter will face the risk of intracranial hypertension. Factors that stimulate cerebral edema include: hypoxia, systemic hypotension, decreased cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and astrocytic swelling.; Cerebral edema: This is one of the most common causes of death from acute liver failure.
