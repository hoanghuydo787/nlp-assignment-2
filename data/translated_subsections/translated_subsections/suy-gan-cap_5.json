Most of the time, doctors focus on treating liver damage, but in many cases, this process also includes managing complications and healing. Some popular methods include:\nDrugs to reverse poisoning: Acute liver failure due to Acetaminophen overdose is often treated with the drug Acetylcysteine ​​to reverse poisoning and reduce damage to the liver.; Drugs to reverse poisoning: Acute liver failure due to Acetaminophen overdose is often treated with the drug Acetylcysteine ​​to reverse poisoning and reduce damage to the liver.\nReducing brain pressure due to excess fluid: Preventing brain edema caused by acute liver failure can increase pressure on the brain. Some medications are used in this condition to reduce fluid buildup.; Reducing brain pressure due to excess fluid: Preventing brain edema caused by acute liver failure can increase pressure on the brain. Several medications are used in this condition to reduce fluid buildup.\nLiver transplant: When acute liver failure cannot be reversed, the only treatment available is a liver transplant. During this process, the surgeon will remove and replace the damaged liver. With implants, most patients can return to normal activities within 6 months. However, these individuals require lifelong medical care, including the use of anti-rejection drugs.(4); Liver transplant: When acute liver failure cannot be reversed, the only treatment available is a liver transplant.
