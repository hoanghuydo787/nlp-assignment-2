    "subsection_content": "Chronic liver failure is the result of long-term inflammation in the liver. This is often the result of cirrhosis, which occurs when healthy tissue is replaced by scar tissue, causing the range of function to gradually be lost and leading to cirrhosis and liver failure. Specifically, this is an organ that performs many important functions in the body, including:\nProduces blood proteins, which support blood clotting, the immune system and oxygen transport.; Bile production participates in the digestion of food; Helps the body store sugar (glucose) in the form of glycogen.; Protects the body by removing toxic substances in the blood.; Break down the structure of saturated fat and produce cholesterol.\nWhen liver failure occurs, this organ no longer functions normally to perform important tasks. In many cases, this condition is urgent and can be directly life-threatening. However, the liver is a good compensation organ, when the function is less than 25%, liver failure clearly shows.(1)",
