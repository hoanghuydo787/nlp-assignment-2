    "subsection_content": "Chronic liver failure comes from many different causes, some typical ones include:\n1. Consequences of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus\nThis is one of the common causes of chronic liver failure. Specifically, hepatitis B virus will cause the liver to swell if worn in adults, the disease is very silent and difficult to detect. Meanwhile, the virus that causes hepatitis C is often very difficult to detect, and symptoms are not common. In many cases, patients have serious liver damage before the infection is detected. In addition, hepatitis B and C viruses often tend to spread through blood. Therefore, to limit the risk of disease, it is important to not share needles, use unsanitary needles for tattoos or piercings, and do not share razors or toothbrushes.\n2. Drink a lot of alcohol for a long time\nChronic liver failure can be the result of a habit of drinking alcohol continuously for at least 10 years. Specifically, this organ has the ability to self-recover and is responsible for decomposing alcohol that the body consumes. After each filtration, some liver cells will also die and gradually develop new cells. However, if you drink too much alcohol, the organ's ability to regenerate is hindered, leading to serious and permanent damage. In addition, in the long term, toxic chemicals also cause the liver to swell, causing liver failure.\n3. Non-alcoholic fatty liver\nThe liver always contains a small amount of fat. However, fat amounts of more than 5 - 10% will cause fatty liver. This is also one of the causes of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and chronic liver failure, directly related to the following factors: (3)\nMetabolic syndrome.; Fat.; Type 2 diabetes.; Genetic.\nIn addition, in some cases, chronic liver failure can also stem from rarer causes, specifically:\nAutoimmune hepatitis.; Biliary tract disease; Budd-Chiari syndrome, causing hepatic vein obstruction; Effects from cancer treatments, typically chemotherapy; Cirrhosis caused by drugs; Genetic variations, such as Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency; Hemoglobinopathy, which causes iron buildup in the liver and other organs in the body; Wilson's disease, which causes copper buildup in the liver and other tissues in the body; Sometimes there is chronic liver failure for which no cause can be found",
