    "subsection_content": "Liver failure is a condition in which the liver reduces its ability to perform normal liver functions, occurring when most of the liver tissue is damaged and unable to function. This is often the final stage of many liver diseases, occurring when most organs have been irreversibly damaged. But there can also be acute liver failure as in drug poisoning...\nSpecifically, the liver undertakes many important functions in the body, including eliminating toxic substances, fighting infections, producing proteins that help blood clot, and creating bile to help digest food. However, if the liver is infected with a virus or chemical, it can lead to damage, cause liver failure, and even stop working in the long run. The disease progresses in 4 specific stages as follows:\nStage 1 - Inflammation: This is the first stage, the liver is inflamed and may function weaker than normal but does not show obvious symptoms, the patient does not feel discomfort or pain yet.; Stage 1 - Inflammation: This is the first stage, the liver is inflamed and may function weaker than normal but does not show obvious symptoms, the patient does not feel discomfort or pain.\nStage 2 – Fibrosis: Untreated inflammation will leave scars. When scar tissue accumulates in the liver, blood circulation is hindered, affecting the functioning of other organs. At this stage, the liver still has the ability to heal if treated and cared for promptly.; Stage 2 – Fibrosis: Untreated inflammation will leave scars. When scar tissue accumulates in the liver, blood circulation is hindered, affecting the functioning of other organs. At this stage, the liver is still capable of healing if treated and cared for promptly.\nStage 3 – Cirrhosis: Hard scar tissue grows more, gradually replacing healthy tissue. At this stage, the patient begins to notice unusual symptoms due to seriously affected liver function; Stage 3 – Cirrhosis: Hard scar tissue grows more, gradually replacing healthy tissue. At this stage, the patient begins to notice unusual symptoms due to seriously affected liver function.\nStage 4 - End-stage liver failure: At this stage, liver transplant is the only method that can cure the disease, otherwise the risk of death will be very high because liver function has declined to the highest level. At this time, a series of dangerous problems can occur at the same time including internal bleeding, fluid retention in the abdomen, brain edema, loss of kidney function, lung problems...
