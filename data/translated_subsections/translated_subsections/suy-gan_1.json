    "subsection_content": "Liver failure is divided into 2 main groups, including:\n1. Acute liver failure\nAcute liver failure is a serious liver dysfunction that can occur in people with no previous history of liver disease. The main cause is often an overdose of a drug, the most common being Acetaminophen, a common pain reliever and fever reducer. Besides, some other common factors include:\nViral infections: viral hepatitis A, E, viral hepatitis B, viral hepatitis C.; Poisoning; Having certain autoimmune diseases; Genetic.\n2. Chronic liver failure\nChronic liver failure is the result of long-term inflammation that leads to the formation of scar tissue that replaces healthy tissue (fibrosis). The development time is slower than acute liver failure, it can take months or even years before obvious symptoms appear. The main cause of this condition is viral hepatitis B and C, alcohol abuse or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)... causing loss of the typical range of inherent functions.",
