    "subsection_content": "In addition to the age factor, after age 30, Testosterone begins to decline naturally, but it is also affected by many of the following hidden factors: (2)\nStress, fatigue: Mental stress, being under a lot of pressure, and frequent insomnia are some of the causes of rapid decline in Testosterone. When stressed, the body releases hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline to help protect the body. However, these hormones inhibit the production of the hormone Testosterone. This explains why when men are stressed, they often lose desire and are no longer interested in sex. One study also showed that people who sleep less than 5 hours per night for 1 week will have Testosterone levels of a person 15 years older.; Sexual abuse: This is a factor leading to testosterone depletion. Excessive sexual activity or masturbation not only causes genital infections such as prostatitis and orchitis, but too much frequency of sex will increase the impact on the nervous organs. , causing the genital organs to be constantly stimulated to operate and ejaculate continuously, the amount of Testosterone in the body is also reduced.; Exposure to toxic chemicals, polluted environment: Toxic chemicals such as dust, pesticides, smoking... not only negatively affect overall health but also affect sexual health of men. Specifically, nicotine and toxic ingredients in cigarettes cause fibrosis, aging of the arteries, blocking blood flow to the penis, causing erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation.\nIn addition, these toxic chemicals also affect Testosterone levels, which is an important component that creates sexual desire, directs the erection process and participates in sperm production. According to documents from the national tobacco control program, it is clear: Smoking reduces sperm production, affecting sperm quality (deformed sperm, poor mobility).\nSide effects of drugs: Some treatment drugs have unwanted effects that reduce the amount of Testosterone in the body such as: sedatives, sleeping pills, drugs to treat stomach ulcers, joints, prostate cancer... is one of the factors that reduce male hormones as well as men's sexual ability.; Suffering from certain diseases: Overweight, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, tendonitis, chronic kidney failure, severe primary hypothyroidism, HIV... are diseases that reduce Testosterone in the body to low levels.\nIn addition, inappropriate lifestyle, diet, and exercise also affect the production of male hormones, leading to low Testosterone, falling below normal levels, causing many serious symptoms for the body. can.",
