    "subsection_content": "A variety of symptoms can occur if Testosterone production plummets. The following are signs that Testosterone levels are decreasing, which every gentleman should understand.\nLow sexual desire\nTestosterone is a hormone that plays an important role in men's physiological functions such as: creating sexual desire, directing the erection process, and controlling the production and nourishment of sperm. Therefore, when the amount of this hormone decreases, it leads to a decrease in sexual desire, men \"lose fire\", are no longer interested, think less about sex, and even avoid sex.\nMen no longer interested in \"love\" is one of the signs of Testosterone decline\nDifficulty with erection\nTestosterone, in addition to its role in creating a man's sexual desire, also directs and supports achieving and maintaining an erection. Testosterone does not produce an erection, but it stimulates receptors in the brain to produce Nitric Oxide. Nitric oxide is a molecule that helps the muscles on the walls of blood vessels relax, allowing blood to circulate and the erection process to take place easily. Therefore, when this hormone is low, it may be difficult for a man to achieve an erection both during sex and spontaneous erection (during sleep). (3)\nHowever, Testosterone is only one of many factors that help contribute to the erection process, so there are no conclusive studies on the role of Testosterone in treating erectile dysfunction. In fact, erectile dysfunction is a sign of decreased Testosterone, but this can also be a sign of many other diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, high cholesterol, and other health problems. Thyroid disorders, mental diseases such as stress and depression.\nLow semen volume\nTestosterone plays a role in semen production, determining the quantity, quality, shape, and mobility of sperm. Men with low Testosterone will often notice a decrease in their semen volume during ejaculation, resulting in less ejaculation. When the quantity and quality of sperm is low, it will affect men's fertility and infertility is a common problem.\nHair loss\nTestosterone plays a role in a number of body functions, including affecting the ciliary system, helping hair and beard grow densely. Baldness can be a natural part of the aging process for many men. Although there is a genetic component to baldness, men with low Testosterone may also experience loss of overall body and facial hair.\nTired\nMen with low Testosterone make men feel very tired, have less energy, and are no longer energetic and active in all activities. They are always tired and lethargic even though they have had enough sleep and do not even want to exercise.\nMuscle loss\nBecause Testosterone plays a role in muscle building, men with low Testosterone may notice a decrease in muscle mass. Studies have shown that Testosterone affects muscle mass by enlarging muscle fibers, maintaining muscle strength. In addition, this hormone also helps ensure a strong connection between the bone body and the periosteum to develop bone size and length synchronously. At the same time, Testosterone also contributes to the development of bone structure by increasing calcium absorption. Therefore, once male hormone levels are reduced, muscle mass becomes loose and less firm.\nThe decrease in male hormones is the factor that causes the body to lose solid muscle mass\nBody accumulates fat\nMen with low Testosterone lose muscle and are replaced by increased fat. Because Testosterone has the role of inhibiting Leptin cells (a hormone that produces fat cells), keeping men's total body fat and belly fat at a low level. Once the amount of male hormones is low, the male body becomes unbalanced, with a lot of fat accumulating in the abdomen, gynecomastia syndrome, or breast tissue hypertrophy. And this is believed to be due to an imbalance between Testosterone and Estrogen in men.\nReduced bone mass\nReduced bone mass, also known as osteoporosis, is a condition that commonly occurs in women. However, men with low male hormones can also experience bone loss. Testosterone helps produce and strengthen bones. Therefore, men with low Testosterone, especially older men, have low bone density and are more susceptible to bone fractures.\nMood changes\nMen with low androgens may experience changes in mood. Because this is a hormone that plays a role in regulating the nervous and mental systems in the body, it has an impact on mood and mental capacity. Many studies show that men with low Testosterone are more likely to face depression, irritability or lack of concentration. As well as health problems causing diseases such as anemia, sleep disorders, depression...\nForgetful, forgetful\nOver time, men's testosterone and cognitive abilities, especially memory, decline. A study at Monash University (Australia) shows that Testosterone helps protect neurons and brings more oxygen to the brain. However, as we age, Testosterone levels in the brain decrease, causing memory loss.\nSmall testicle size\nLow testosterone levels in the body are also the \"culprit\" that causes the testicles to be smaller than average. Because the body needs Testosterone to develop sexual organs, including the penis and testicles. When Testosterone exists at low levels, it will cause the penis or testicles to be small, even disproportionate. However, small testicles have many other causes.\nAnemia\nTestosterone plays a role in stimulating the bone marrow to create hematopoiesis, increasing red and white blood cells. According to a research article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, doctors link low testosterone with an increased risk of anemia. When researchers administered Testosterone gel to anemic men with low Testosterone, they saw improvements in blood counts compared to men who used a placebo gel. Some symptoms that anemia can cause include difficulty concentrating, cramps, difficulty sleeping, dizziness, and an abnormally fast heart rate.\nIn addition, low Testosterone also causes other diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and thyroid-related diseases.",
