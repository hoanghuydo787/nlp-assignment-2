Before the test, the doctor will ask the patient to stop taking medications that can affect hormone levels in the blood.\nTestosterone test results show the level of Testosterone concentration. If Testosterone is in the range of 10-35 nanomol/liter, it is a normal healthy level. If the index is lower than this threshold, it will affect the health, physiological and reproductive abilities of men such as: fatigue, reduced sexual interest, difficulty in erecting the penis, infertility...\nThe test measures the amount of Testosterone in the blood",
