    "subsection_content": "Varicose veins of the lower limbs, also known as varicose veins of the legs, is a condition in which blood in the venous system stagnates in the legs and does not go up the vena cava to return to the heart as usual. This condition increases hydrostatic pressure within the veins, causing the veins to dilate. If not treated promptly and properly, the disease will continue to progress and the arterial blood flow to the legs will also decrease.\nAs a result, the patient will experience a feeling of heaviness in the legs, aches and pains, leg swelling, numbness, numbness, tingling, cramps at night... Even more severe cases of leg blood circulation disorders can lead to to complications such as eczema, non-healing leg ulcers... making treatment longer and more difficult. Varicose veins in young people have tended to increase recently.",
