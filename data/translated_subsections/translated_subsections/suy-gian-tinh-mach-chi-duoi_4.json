    "subsection_content": "Clinical examination: Varicose veins can be diagnosed by exploiting risk factors and symptoms of the patient. In patients with thin subcutaneous tissue, the veins can be seen and felt to dilate and stretch quickly when moving from a lying to standing position.; Vascular Doppler ultrasound: Ultrasound confirms the diagnosis when recording reflux flow through the venous valve with a duration of >0.5 seconds in the saphenous vein and deep vein in the lower leg or >0.1 second in the femoral popliteal vein . Ultrasound can identify damage to the greater saphenous, lesser saphenous, deep veins, and perforating venous valves to help choose the appropriate treatment technique.\nSee more sharing from THS.BS Nguyen Anh Dung about the disease Varicose Veins of the lower limbs",
