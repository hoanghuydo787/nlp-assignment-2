    "subsection_content": "At the Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, examination and diagnosis of varicose veins in the legs are performed with modern equipment, combined with \"individualized\" treatment regimens, applying many advanced techniques in the treatment of varicose veins. Treatment such as: Medical treatment, surgery or laser or intravascular radiofrequency to remove diseased superficial veins... helps patients escape pain and prevent dangerous complications.\nInternally medical treatment\nDrugs that increase the strength of vein walls such as daflon, ginko biloba, rutin C help improve symptoms and slow down disease progression. However, these drugs are only effective in the early stages of the disease, supporting stabilization after endovenous laser or radiofrequency treatments. Physical therapy with air bags that create intermittent pressure in layers along with leg muscle exercises to help create better venous circulation and strengthen the blood vessel walls are techniques to improve symptoms and disease condition. .\nThe air bag creates intermittent pressure in stages\nRemoval of diseased superficial veins\nSuperficial varicose veins ranging from C2 to C6 according to the grading described above require surgery or intravascular laser or radiofrequency to remove diseased superficial veins.\nSurgery\nStripping: Removing varicose superficial veins with a specialized instrument inserted into the vein is called Stripping surgery. This is a fairly thorough treatment method, with the lowest recurrence rate. Before the 2000s, saphenous vein stripping surgery was the main technique to treat varicose veins of the lower limbs. Over the past 10 years, endovenous laser and radiofrequency techniques have been applied and have brought very good results. Today, with the development of intravenous laser and radiofrequency techniques, stripping surgery has almost completely replaced; CHIVA: This is the abbreviation for the technique \"Cure conservatrice et Hemodynamique de L'Insuffisance Veineuse en Ambulatoire\", which is a small surgery with local anesthesia, only removing the damaged valve and removing the collateral vein. The goal is to preserve the saphenous vein, keeping it as a grafted blood vessel for blood vessel bypass surgeries such as coronary artery bypass, lower limb artery bypass... To perform the CHIVA technique well, the doctor will perform an ultrasound assessment. Accurately mark the location of damaged venous valves and collateral veins.\nPreoperative ultrasound to mark (mapping) damaged veins\nLaser or intravascular RFA\nSuperficial veins, the greater saphenous vein or the lesser saphenous vein, are indicated if there is damage identified on ultrasound. The doctor will insert a laser or radiofrequency energy wire into the varicose veins. This guide wire insertion process is performed under ultrasound guidance. After determining that the tip of the guide wire is in the correct position to be treated, the heat energy generated at the tip of the guide wire will create a reaction that causes the endothelium to become fibrous, the vessel wall to shrink, and the vein to atrophy. The guide wire will be pulled back at 1cm intervals while the guide wire generates energy, until it is completely pulled back out of the vein.\nLaser/RFA energy shrinks and atrophies the veins",
