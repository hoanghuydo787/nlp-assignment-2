    "subsection_content": "1. Age\nAge is the first studied factor in relation to venous disease. Currently, all authors recognize that advanced age is a factor that increases the risk of chronic venous insufficiency and varicose veins in the legs. The usual age for varicose veins is 45-50 years old or older. The older you get, the more severe varicose veins become.\n2. Gender\nMany studies show that varicose veins are more common in women than men. For every 2-3 female patients with the disease, only 1 male patient has varicose veins. However, some studies show that, for chronic venous insufficiency, the incidence rate between men and women is similar. The difference in incidence between men and women in varicose veins is probably explained by the fact that women often have to go through pregnancy.\nIn large, multicenter studies in Germany and Italy, it was noted that in women with venous insufficiency, the rate of leg edema was often higher than in men; Meanwhile, men with varicose veins are often more susceptible to eczema and leg ulcers than women.\n3. Occupation – Habit of standing for long periods of time\nAccording to previous studies, occupations related to the habit of standing for long periods of time, walking a lot... have been identified as risk factors that increase the incidence of chronic venous insufficiency and varicose veins in the legs. However, this is just a hypothesis because medicine has not clearly proven by what mechanism the habit of standing for long periods of time causes varicose veins. There are also a few recent studies showing that standing for long periods of time is not related, or only slightly related, to varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency of the legs.\n4. Family nature\nStudies show that venous insufficiency and varicose veins run in families. If one person has the disease, other blood relatives in the family are also susceptible to the same disease, with a frequency of 1.5-2 times that of normal people. However, currently medicine has not yet proven whether the disease is hereditary or not and has not determined whether there is a gene that causes the disease or not.\n5. Obesity\nThe role of obesity in the relationship with varicose veins still has many conflicting opinions. According to research in the UK, a BMI >27 increases the risk of varicose veins in women, but does not increase this risk in men. Another large study in Germany (Bonn study) showed that BMI > 30 only insignificantly increased the risk of varicose veins in women, but clearly increased the risk of varicose veins in both men and women. male and female.\n6. Pregnancy\nPregnancy, multiple births, and pregnancy increase the risk of varicose veins in the legs. Women who have been pregnant and have had multiple pregnancies are twice as likely to get the disease as non-pregnant women and men.\n7. Hormones – Birth control pills\nUse of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis. However, birth control pills and hormones have not been linked to venous insufficiency and varicose veins, and do not increase the risk of this disease.\n8. Chronic constipation\nSome authors consider chronic constipation as a risk factor for varicose veins. However, to date, studies have not shown enough evidence that this is a real risk factor for this disease.\nAccording to MSc. Le Thi Ngoc Hang - Doctor at Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, although these factors increase a person's risk of disease, they do not necessarily cause the disease. Some people with one or more risk factors never develop varicose veins, while others develop them and have no known risk factors. However, knowing the risk factors for any disease can help guide us in taking appropriate actions, including behavioral changes and clinical monitoring.",
