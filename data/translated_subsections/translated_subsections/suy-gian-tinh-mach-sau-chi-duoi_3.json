    "subsection_content": "Common serious complications of deep varicose veins include:\n1. Deep vein thrombosis\nWhen suffering from venous insufficiency of the lower limbs, venous blood cannot return to the heart correctly, often the venous valves are weak and open, so venous blood rushes to the legs, creating stagnant blood flow. There are two types of blood clots: superficial blood clots in cases of superficial varicose veins (or phlebitis) and deep vein blood clots called deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\nA blood clot in a deep vein can travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism, leading to death. This is one of the most serious health risks associated with untreated varicose veins.\n2. Bleeding\nSome people are at risk of bleeding when enlarged superficial veins near the surface of the skin burst. If varicose veins bleed, stop the bleeding quickly.\nLeg elevation: Lie down on a flat surface and elevate your legs. You can use a few pillows for support.; Apply firm pressure: Place a clean cloth or towel over the bleeding area and press firmly, for at least 10 minutes.; If bleeding is heavy or does not stop, see your doctor immediately.\n3. Ulcers\nAbout 70% of leg ulcers are caused by venous problems, especially venous insufficiency. Symptoms include swelling, rash and brown discoloration on the affected areas, most commonly the lower third of the leg focusing on the inside of the ankle. This condition can cause pain and fatigue for the patient. Treatment is often long and expensive, affecting quality of life and the economy.\n4. Lipodermatosclerosis\nLower extremity venous insufficiency is a major symptom of a disease called Lipodermatosclerosis (LDS). People with this condition often experience pain, hardening of the skin, changes in skin color, swelling and tapering of the legs above the ankles.\nLDS is described as a disease of the skin and connective tissue. If left untreated, lipodermatosclerosis can lead to chronic venous leg ulcers, which are difficult to heal. LDS also severely limits the ability to walk or run and can adversely affect a person's overall health.",
