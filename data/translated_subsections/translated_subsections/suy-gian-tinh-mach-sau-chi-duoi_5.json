    "subsection_content": "There are several different ways to treat lower extremity deep venous valve insufficiency, including both surgical and nonsurgical methods.\nLaser burning method to treat varicose veins in the legs at the Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, HCM\n1. Foam sclerotherapy under ultrasound guidance\nHowever, due to its limited nature due to high recurrence rate and risk of pulmonary embolism, according to the current treatment protocol of the American Society of Venepuncture, foam sclerotherapy is only applied to cases of cardiovascular failure. Grade C1 veins, meaning telangiectasia and reticular veins located superficially under the skin, are not indicated for occlusion or elimination of reflux in the saphenous vein.\n2. Endovenous laser intervention or RFA\nThis method is guided by ultrasound and is commonly used to treat the great saphenous veins.\nFor this procedure, the patient is given local anesthesia and a laser fiber is inserted into the great saphenous vein. The emitted energy is converted into heat, causing destruction, shrinkage, and atrophy of the vein requiring intervention. The treated vein will become clogged and no longer circulate blood. Endovascular intervention techniques are always superior because they are less invasive, quicker to recover, and more aesthetic.\n3. VenaSeal vein glue\nThis is the newest and most modern minimally invasive treatment technology for deep varicose veins today. This method is performed by injecting VenaSeal glue through a small catheter into the abnormal vein to harden it. Once the vein closes, blood is safely redirected into healthy veins in the leg.\n4. Compression stockings\nCompression therapy is an effective treatment modality whose mechanism is still not fully understood. Clinical effectiveness depends on two main factors: surface pressure and calf muscle stiffness.\nSuperficial pressure is the pressure exerted by the stocking on the surface of the diseased skin. The pressure of the socks is carefully calculated in the laboratory so that the socks are manufactured.\nCompression stockings are woven with special techniques so that the pressure applied to each segment of the leg is consistent with normal physiology, being tighter at the ankle and gradually loosening as you go up, always hugging the leg and pushing blood out. follow the veins to the heart.\nMild varicose veins can be treated with compression stockings, combined with changes in standing and sitting habits and diet.",
