    "subsection_content": "Respiratory Failure is a condition in which the lungs do not receive enough oxygen, or the accumulation of too much carbon dioxide damages organs in the body. This condition reduces arterial oxygenation, resulting in a slowdown in oxygen delivery to tissues. (first)\nThis syndrome is divided into two types: acute and chronic. Usually when people refer to this lung failure condition, they mean an acute condition. In practice, respiratory failure is defined by PaO2 (arterial partial pressure of oxygen) < 60mmHg and/or PaCO2 (arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide) > 50mmHg.",
