These lesions can affect the patient's airways or lungs; or affects the patient's muscles, nerves, bones and tissues that support breathing\", said Prof. Dr. Ngo Quy Chau. (3)\nCauses of this syndrome include pulmonary causes and extrapulmonary causes.\n1. Causes in the lungs\nInfectious lung diseases such as bronchitis, pulmonary fibrosis, tuberculosis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, bronchial obstruction, etc.; Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema.\n2. Extrapulmonary causes\nLaryngotracheal obstruction due to laryngeal tumors, cervical esophageal tumors, and tracheal tumors; due to infection in the larynx, stuck food or foreign objects blocking the larynx, etc.; Pleural effusion, a rapid increase in fluid volume increases the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome/disease; Injuries to the chest cause broken ribs, damage to the pleura and lungs.; Damage to the nervous system such as traumatic brain injury or stroke affects the functioning of the respiratory system.\nDamage to the nervous system can damage the respiratory system",
