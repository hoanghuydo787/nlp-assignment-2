    "subsection_content": "Lung failure is at high risk of occurring in the following groups of people:\n1. Premature babies\nPremature babies are at higher risk of lung failure than other babies, because their lungs are not fully developed, and they are at risk of pulmonary hypertension and other birth defects in the lungs.\n2. Elderly people\nOlder people are also at risk because their resistance is reduced, making them susceptible to colds leading to infections and damage to the chest and lungs.\n3. People are often exposed to dust and toxic chemicals\nSome jobs require exposure to irritants such as dust, chemicals, asbestos, dyes, etc. over a long period of time can cause lung damage, patients are susceptible to dangerous lung complications, including asthma. acute lung failure.\n4. People who smoke and use stimulants\nPeople who regularly smoke, or inhale cigarette smoke (passive smoking) are at risk of lung diseases, increasing the likelihood of impaired respiratory function.; People who use stimulants and drink too much alcohol can affect the nervous system - the organ that controls breathing. At this time, the patient may breathe slowly and shallowly, easily experiencing acute respiratory failure of COPD.\nHabitual use of alcohol, tobacco and stimulants increases the risk of severe lung failure\n5. People with a history of injury to the respiratory tract\nImpaired respiratory function is at risk of occurring in people who have experienced respiratory injuries such as:\nDifficulty breathing, lack of air entering the lungs after weakness due to stroke, or due to collapsed airways, trapped food blocking the patient's trachea.; Patients with diseases affecting the lungs such as pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)...; Patients with diseases that affect the nervous system and muscles responsible for controlling breathing such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal cord injury, stroke...; Patients have problems in the spine, which can affect the bones and muscles used for breathing such as scoliosis.; Patients experience injuries to the chest and lungs, causing damage to the tissue and ribs surrounding the lungs or direct damage to the lungs.; Overdose of stimulants and alcohol; Patients inhale toxic gases and toxic waste.",
