    "subsection_content": "Patients need to provide medical history information about themselves and their family, especially respiratory diseases if any. At the same time, the patient needs to describe in detail any unusual symptoms of the body, because these can be initial signs, signaling early the risk of respiratory failure.\nYour doctor may ask about your symptoms and medical history to make a more accurate diagnosis\n1. Examination\nThe doctor can conduct a health and condition examination of the patient including the following steps:\nCheck the skin color of the lips, fingers and toes to see if they are pale or pale;; Listen to the heartbeat, check whether the heartbeat is normal or disordered;; Listen to the lungs and check for unusual sounds when breathing; At the same time, check whether the chest moves when breathing;; Pulse Oximetry: Use a clip on your finger to measure blood oxygen levels;; Measure blood pressure, check whether the patient's blood pressure is normal or too high or too low;; Measure the patient's body temperature to check for signs of fever, if any.\n2. Paraclinical examination\nYour doctor may prescribe a number of paraclinical testing methods to help diagnose the disease more accurately:\nArterial blood gas test: Take blood samples from the patient's arteries, check oxygen, carbon dioxide, pH, bicarbonate levels to determine respiratory problems, if any; Blood test: Helps detect the cause of lung function decline, as well as the functioning of other organs in the body.; Check the patient's blood, urine or sputum samples to determine whether there is a bacterial infection or not; Bronchoscopy: Checks for bronchial obstruction, tumors and other causes of lung failure.; Chest X-ray: Identify agents in the lungs or heart causing respiratory failure.; Chest computed tomography: Check the lungs and detect signs of inflammation and damage, if any; Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG): Checks the heart's rhythm and activity; Lung ultrasound: Check the functioning of the lungs.; Lung biopsy: Collect lung tissue samples from the patient.\nX-ray and computed tomography of the chest help detect lung lesions that cause impaired respiratory system function.",
