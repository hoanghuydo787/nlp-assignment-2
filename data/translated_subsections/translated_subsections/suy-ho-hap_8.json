    "subsection_content": "Prof. Dr. Ngo Quy Chau said that the main purpose of treating respiratory system deterioration is to bring oxygen to the lungs and other organs, and at the same time remove carbon dioxide from the patient's body. In addition, treatment methods also help eliminate pathogens, limit the risk of dangerous complications, and improve the patient's quality of life.\nTreatment methods include:\n1. Oxygen therapy\nThere are many ways to deliver oxygen to the patient's lungs. Depending on the severity of the disease, the doctor will prescribe appropriate oxygen therapy.\nNasal cannula: A plastic tube attached to a portable oxygen tank is placed into the patient's nose. Where the patient needs a special system to receive a higher flow of oxygen is called a high-flow nasal cannula.; Ventilation mask: The patient wears a mask attached to the air bag so that more oxygen enters the lungs. This therapy is used in cases of patients with acute respiratory failure who are waiting for a rather complicated treatment process.; Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV): This method uses a mask or device that covers the patient's nose or nose and mouth. A tube connects the mask to a machine that blows air into the tube, ensuring the patient's airway is kept open while sleeping. This method is also used in the treatment of sleep apnea.; Mechanical ventilator: When the above oxygen therapies do not work, the patient's blood oxygen level does not increase or the patient still feels short of breath, in this case the doctor will prescribe a mechanical ventilator. This ventilator helps blow air with high levels of oxygen into the patient's airways and lungs. However, this method is not indicated for long-term use because it can have a negative impact on the patient's lungs and respiratory tract, risking infections such as pneumonia.; Tracheostomy: This method is used in cases where the patient's airway is obstructed. At this time, the doctor will surgically create a hole through the front of the neck and into the trachea, called a tracheostomy or tracheal tube, to help the patient breathe easily.; Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO): Used for patients with symptoms of severe respiratory failure. This method pumps blood through an artificial lung to supplement oxygen and remove carbon dioxide before returning the blood to the body. This method can be used for several days or weeks to give the lungs time to recover. However, long-term use is not recommended because it can cause blood clots, bleeding and infection, which can be life-threatening.\nDepending on the level of respiratory organ failure, the doctor will prescribe appropriate oxygen therapy for the patient\n2. Drug treatment\nYour doctor may prescribe a number of medications to treat the cause or improve symptoms, including:\nAntibiotics: Used to treat lung infections such as pneumonia; Bronchodilators: Help open airways, or treat asthma attacks.; Corticosteroids: Shrink the airways, treat symptoms of airway inflammation.\n3. Other treatment methods\nIn case the patient must be hospitalized for long-term treatment, the doctor may prescribe some additional methods to manage and prevent complications of respiratory organ failure from occurring.\nFluids: Fluids are infused from the veins into the patient's blood vessels, helping to improve blood flow throughout the body.; Nutritional support: Patients need to receive nutritional infusions throughout the mechanical ventilation process, ensuring the body receives all the necessary nutrients.; Physical therapy: This method helps maintain body strength, prevent the formation of ulcers, and also helps shorten the time of mechanical ventilation, speeding up the patient's recovery process.; Pulmonary rehabilitation: Patients are instructed in exercises to improve oxygen levels and restore lung function; Blood thinners: If the patient is seriously ill, the doctor will prescribe blood thinners to prevent the formation of blood clots.",
