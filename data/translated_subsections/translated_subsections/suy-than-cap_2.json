    "subsection_content": "Causes of acute kidney failure are divided into 3 large groups according to pathogenesis: pre-renal, renal and post-renal. As follows:\n1. Pre-renal causes\nReduced cardiac output\nPrerenal acute renal failure is often caused by reduced cardiac output (also known as blood flow frequency), causing a shortage of blood pumped by the heart to other organs, including the kidneys. Kidney anemia is often due to causes related to the heart such as: myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, pericardial tamponade, severe cardiac output failure...\nReduced blood flow\nCases of blood loss/hemorrhagic shock, vomiting/diarrhea, use of diuretics, post-obstruction diuretics, temporary fluid loss also cause a sudden decrease in blood flow to the kidneys, causing kidney damage. grant. In addition, this condition also appears in people with: cirrhosis, pancreatitis, burns, general anesthesiology...\nIn addition, cases of septic shock and hemodynamic changes in the kidney are also considered causes of pre-renal acute kidney failure.\n2. Causes in the kidneys\nBlood vessel\nIn large and medium blood vessels, there are blood clots, thrombi that block the renal artery or the artery is mistakenly clamped during surgery, bilateral renal vein thrombosis... causing unstable blood flow in the kidneys. , cause disease.\nIn the patient's small blood vessels, there are atheroembolic events, microvascular thrombosis (TMA), acute scleroderma attacks, acute hypertension, hemolytic anemia syndrome - increased liver enzymes - decreased platelets (HELLP)... affects kidney health.\nGlomerulus\nProblems in the glomerulus, the vascular tuft that is responsible for filtering blood in the kidney, cause Nephrotic Syndrome (large proteinuria), rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis due to many reasons... causing acute kidney failure.\nInterstitial tissue\nSome causes of acute kidney failure related to the interstitium are acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), due to antibiotics, diuretics, NSAIDs, anticonvulsants, allopurinol or infections: bacteria, viruses. , TB…\nRenal tubules\nAcute tubular necrosis (ATN) is also one of the causes of kidney failure in the kidney. In addition, renal ischemia due to shock, hemorrhage, trauma, gram-negative sepsis, acute pancreatitis, hypotension due to any cause also damages the kidneys.
