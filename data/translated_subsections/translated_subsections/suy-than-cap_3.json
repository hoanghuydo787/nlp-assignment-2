    "subsection_content": "According to Urology and Nephrology experts, Tam Anh General Hospital system, although acute kidney failure often appears suddenly and is short-term, if not managed seriously, it can still cause dangerous complications. .\n1. Chronic kidney failure\nSometimes the disease can cause permanent loss of kidney function. This condition is also known as chronic kidney failure. Initial symptoms include: nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, itching, chest tightness, uncontrolled high blood pressure, unusual weight loss... People with end-stage kidney disease (kidney failure) need to Lifelong dialysis to remove toxins, waste and excess water from the body or a kidney transplant to maintain life.\n2. Heart damage\nThe heart and kidneys have a close relationship with each other. If the kidneys do not function well, the hormone system that regulates blood pressure is unstable, causing the heart to pump more blood. This condition puts the heart under a lot of pressure and is vulnerable to damage. (2)\n3. Damage to the nervous system\nAcute kidney failure can cause neuromuscular disorders, causing seizures and coma. This condition will cause damage to the nervous system that will be difficult to recover.\n4. End stage kidney failure\nThe kidneys filter waste and excess water from the patient's blood and eliminate it as urine. People with acute kidney failure are susceptible to chronic complications and you gradually lose function over time and develop end-stage kidney failure.\nAt this time, the patient's kidneys only function less than 10% of their normal capacity and cause a series of symptoms such as: little urination, urinary retention, fatigue, getting sick easily, headaches, loss of appetite, weight loss, dry and itchy skin, changes in skin color, bone pain, confusion, difficulty concentrating...\nComplete completion of the treatment regimen is one of the important factors affecting the survival prognosis of patients with kidney failure. Therefore, at this time, patients should proactively visit and cooperate with a urologist to find the most effective and suitable solution for themselves.\n5. High blood pressure\nChanges in kidney function caused by acute kidney failure can upset the body's natural balance of salt and fluid. This change causes the patient's blood pressure to increase. If left untreated, high blood pressure can lead to heart attack and stroke. (3)\n6. Muscle weakness\nWhen the body's fluids and electrolytes are imbalanced due to acute kidney damage and not treated promptly, muscle weakness can result.\n7. Chest tightness and difficulty breathing\nAcute kidney failure leads to fluid accumulation in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. If the pericardium becomes inflamed, the patient may also have chest pain.",
