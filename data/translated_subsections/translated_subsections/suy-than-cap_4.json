    "subsection_content": "Accurate diagnosis of the condition is very important in helping doctors decide on a treatment regimen for each patient. Accordingly, when a patient is suspected of having acute kidney failure, the doctor will prescribe the following measures.\nClinical diagnosis\nThe doctor asks the patient's medical history and observes the patient's symptoms. Depending on specific symptoms such as little urination or urinary retention, dehydration, blood loss, infection, renal colic... the doctor will make a preliminary assessment and prescribe appropriate laboratory methods.\nParaclinical diagnosis\nUrine test\nUrinalysis is ordered for urine protein (albumin), creatinine, and red blood cells. Absence of protein, red blood cells, or columnar cells suggests uncomplicated pre-renal or post-renal acute kidney failure. Eosinophilic urine suggests allergic tubulointerstitial nephritis; There are oxalate and urate crystals, suggesting renal tubular obstruction due to these crystals. Urine tests help give a more accurate picture of how well the kidneys are working so that doctors can have appropriate treatment plans.\nBlood tests\nThis is one of the main tests in diagnosing acute kidney failure. The role of this test is to measure the concentration of creatinine, urea, uric acid, electrolytes (especially important potassium)... in the patient's blood to evaluate kidney function.\nStomach supersonic\nThis method is used to evaluate the preserved kidney size as shown by clear cortical-medullary distinction. At the same time, detect the causes of obstruction in acute kidney injury with post-renal causes. Ultrasound helps evaluate and determine whether kidney failure is acute or chronic.\nX-ray of the urinary system\nThis is one of the routine measures in diagnosing kidney disease, especially diseases caused by obstruction or infection caused by bacterial attack, in order to evaluate kidney function. X-rays of the urinary system can also detect stones in post-obstructive acute kidney injury.\nImplementing the quadrants\nDetermining acute or chronic kidney failure is sometimes difficult because symptoms of nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperkalemia can be seen in both cases. Therefore, doctors can rely on:\nPast medical history: Patient has a history of previous kidney disease, increased BUN and serum creatinine several months ago; Kidney size on ultrasound, cortical pulp echogenicity.; Anemia: If the patient does not have anemia, it can be diagnosed as acute kidney failure. Early stages of chronic kidney disease may have little or no anemia. Some cases still have anemia in acute kidney failure such as blood loss due to traffic accidents, obstetrics or other acute blood loss conditions...\nDiagnose the cause\nTo diagnose the cause of acute kidney failure, the doctor will conduct a medical history of which group (pre-renal, renal, post-renal) and check the urine test results.\nDiagnosis of precipitating factors\nThis diagnostic method helps stratify the risk of acute kidney failure based on exposure factors and increased susceptibility to provide appropriate treatment regimens.",
