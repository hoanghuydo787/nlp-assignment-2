    "subsection_content": "The goal of treating acute kidney failure is to protect the patient's life, prevent death, create favorable conditions for the kidneys to recover, and minimize the risk of progression to chronic kidney disease. Specifically, treatment methods for acute kidney failure depend on the cause of the disease as follows:\nTreatment of acute prerenal renal failure\nPrerenal acute renal failure is mostly caused by extrarenal diseases. Prerenal renal failure can be divided into groups:\n1. Reduced circulating volume\nYour doctor will find and treat the cause of hypovolemia. In the absence of hemorrhagic shock, the patient will be given crystalloid solution and evaluated for effectiveness according to the prescribed indicators.\n2. Reduced cardiac output\nIf the patient has acute kidney failure due to reduced cardiac output, treatment will start from underlying diseases such as congestive heart failure, acute cardiac tamponade, acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism...\n3. Reduces systemic circuit resistance\nDoctors treat sepsis, decompensated cirrhosis, etc. for patients with acute kidney failure due to reduced systemic vascular resistance to restore kidney health.\nTreatment of acute renal failure in the kidney (specifically acute tubular necrosis)\nAcute tubular necrosis is due to ischemia to the whole or local kidney. Severe and prolonged acute pre-renal kidney failure is the leading cause. In addition, acute tubular necrosis is also caused by toxins that act directly on renal tubular cells such as: aminoglycosides antibiotics, amphotericin B, Pentamidine, heavy metals, cyclosporine, intravenous contrast agents... or due to pigments. tubulotoxic factors, allergic interstitial nephritis...\nInitial treatment\nIf due to toxic causes, the patient is instructed to immediately stop or reduce the dose of drugs that cannot be stopped suddenly. If due to anemia, replace fluids, blood, and electrolytes to serve the primary goal of improving kidney perfusion.\nTreat with some drugs to treat kidney failure such as diuretics, low dose Dopamine, Fenoldopam...; Treatment of acute tubular necrosis in the oligo-anuric phase:\nAddress the consequences and complications of acute kidney failure. The most important is the balance of water - electrolytes, acid-base and metabolism.\nReference\n5. Hemodialysis in acute kidney failure\nHemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis are equally effective in treating acute kidney failure. However, hemodialysis will be chosen in extremely urgent cases such as acute pulmonary edema, hyperkalemia, ventricular fibrillation, etc.\n6. Hemodialysis\nHemodialysis is a method of using a machine placed outside the body to create a circulation cycle that carries blood containing many electrolytes and waste through a filter and returns clean blood back to the patient.\n7. Peritoneal dialysis\nPeritoneal dialysis is also known as peritoneal dialysis. Unlike hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis uses the patient's own abdominal mucosa to eliminate toxins from the blood.",
