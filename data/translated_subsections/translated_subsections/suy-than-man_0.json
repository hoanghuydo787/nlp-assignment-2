    "subsection_content": "Chronic kidney failure is stage 5 – the final stage – of chronic kidney disease. This is the most severe stage with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 15mL/min/1.73 m2, manifested by high blood urea syndrome. This condition can be fatal, if not treated with kidney replacement therapy.\nPatients need hemodialysis or a kidney transplant to maintain life. Some patients may also choose conservative care to control symptoms, with the goal of achieving the best possible quality of life during the remaining time or while waiting for dialysis or a kidney transplant.\nStatistics show that in the world there are about 3 million people with chronic kidney failure receiving kidney replacement therapy and this is increasing rapidly. In fact, kidney replacement treatments are only popular in developed countries (up to 80%). In developing countries, only 10-20% of patients receive kidney replacement therapy and even do not receive treatment, leading to a quite high mortality rate.",
