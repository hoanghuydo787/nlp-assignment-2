(3)\nSpecific treatments for chronic kidney failure:\nTreat symptoms\nDepending on the patient's unusual symptoms, the doctor will choose appropriate treatment measures to make the patient feel more comfortable.\nRenal replacement therapy\nUnless the patient refuses, all people with chronic renal failure with clinical manifestations of uremic syndrome (usually occurring when creatinine clearance is less than 15 ml/min or earlier in people with diabetes) are indication for renal replacement therapy.\nThere are three types of renal replacement therapy available. The doctor may prescribe one of three methods, depending on the patient's specific condition.\nHemodialysis (or hemodialysis, hemodialysis, hemodialysis – HD)\nDialysis is a method of replacing some kidney functions when the kidneys no longer function effectively. The patient's blood follows a tube through a system of machines placed outside the body to remove toxins and waste. After that, the purified blood is returned to the patient's body. Hemodialysis is usually performed 3 times a week, each session taking about 4 hours.\nStudies have shown that dialysis, if done properly, improves overall health and helps patients live longer. Every month, people receiving dialysis will have their treatment progress monitored with tests to review the effectiveness of this method.\nPeritoneal dialysis (peritoneal dialysis – PD)\nWith peritoneal dialysis, the membrane inside the patient's abdomen (peritoneum) acts as a natural filter to eliminate waste and toxins. The filtrate will flow through a soft plastic tube (catheter) into the patient's abdomen. Once the filtration process is finished, the fluid will be flushed from the body.\nCurrently available peritoneal dialysis methods are Continuous Ambulatory Dialysis (CAPD) and Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD). The basic treatment goals are the same, but the number of treatments and the way these two methods are performed are different. APD differs from CAPD in that it requires circulatory support and treatment is often performed at night, while the patient sleeps. Peritoneal dialysis by machine also brings more effective and quality treatment to patients.\nKidney transplant\nKidney transplant is a surgical method used to replace a kidney that has lost function with a healthy kidney to maintain the patient's life. Kidneys will be taken from living donors or people who are brain dead or cardiac dead (heart stops beating). The kidney transplant process takes time, because finding a donor is relatively complicated.\nAfter kidney transplant surgery, the patient will need to be monitored in the hospital for a few days to a few weeks. When health is stable, the patient is discharged from the hospital but needs regular health checks to ensure the recovery process is continuing. At the same time, the patient will be given medication to prevent graft rejection and reduce the risk of complications after surgery, such as infection. After a successful transplant, the new kidney will function and the patient will no longer need dialysis.",
