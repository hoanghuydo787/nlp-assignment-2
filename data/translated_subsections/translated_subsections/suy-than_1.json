Acute pre-renal kidney failure This is a case of kidney failure Acute occurs when there is insufficient blood flow to the kidneys, affecting the kidneys' ability to eliminate toxins. The cause of this condition is injury, surgery or other diseases. Symptoms of acute pre-renal kidney failure are often: loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, seizures, coma... This type of disease can be cured, if the doctor identifies the cause of reduced blood flow. 2. Acute Intrinsic Renal Failure Acute intrinsic renal failure can be caused by direct trauma to the kidney, such as physical impacts or accidents. Causes also include toxin overload and ischemia or lack of oxygen to the kidneys. Among them, the causes of ischemia include: serious bleeding, renal vascular obstruction, glomerulonephritis... 3. Prerenal chronic renal failure When there is insufficient renal perfusion for a long time, the kidney start to shrink. Gradually, the kidneys lose their ability to function, which is called chronic prerenal renal failure. 4. Chronic renal failure in the kidneys This condition of chronic kidney failure occurs when the kidneys are damaged long-term due to diseases occurring in the kidneys such as glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis, tubular nephritis... Internal kidney diseases develop from trauma Direct injury to the kidneys includes severe bleeding or lack of oxygen. 5. Postrenal chronic kidney failure Long-term urinary tract obstruction, including high urinary tract obstruction and lower urinary tract obstruction, will prevent urine from escaping. This puts pressure on the kidneys and ultimately damages them.",
