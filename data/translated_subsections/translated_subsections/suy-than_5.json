    "subsection_content": "Although dialysis can help reduce pressure on the kidneys and make them stronger, it cannot completely replace kidney function. Therefore, sick people are still at risk of dangerous complications, even leading to death. Some of the most common complications of kidney failure include:\nAnemia\nAnyone can get anemia, but the condition is more common in people with chronic kidney disease. Patients may start to have anemia in the early stages, but it becomes more severe in stages 3-5. The cause of this condition is that the kidneys help the body create red blood cells. When the kidneys do not function normally, the body will lack red blood cells, causing anemia.\nBone disease and hyperphosphatemia\nEach person needs calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus to have strong bones. When the kidneys are healthy, they will keep the levels of these substances stable and protect bone health. If impaired function, the kidneys may not be able to perform this balancing role. In particular, when the kidneys are weak, phosphorus is not excreted but accumulates in the blood, called hyperphosphatemia, which is dangerous.\nHeart disease\nCardiovascular and kidney diseases are closely related. At the same time, heart disease is the most common cause of death in people on dialysis.\nThis is explained as heart disease will affect blood circulation. Blood backed up in the heart causes pressure to build up in the main vein connected to the kidneys, which can lead to blockage and reduced oxygenated blood supply to the kidneys. This can cause kidney disease.\nAnd like a cycle, when the kidneys are not working well, the patient's hormone system that regulates blood pressure has to work harder to increase blood supply to the kidneys. At that time, the heart has to work harder, leading to heart disease.\nHyperkalemia\nPotassium exists mainly in foods and helps muscles function, including the muscles that control heart rate and breathing. If the kidneys are healthy, they will excrete excess potassium to balance the concentration of this substance in the blood.\nFor people with kidney failure, the kidneys cannot or do not eliminate excess potassium, causing too much of this component to exist in the blood, called hyperkalemia. This condition can cause a heart attack or lead to death. The most common symptoms of hyperkalemia are: feeling tired, weak, stomach pain, nausea, muscle pain or cramps, shortness of breath, abnormal heart rate, chest pain...\nAccumulation of water in the body\nHealthy kidneys will remove excess fluid in the blood, avoiding the risk of accumulation causing problems in the heart and lungs, high blood pressure... Symptoms of this condition are a faster heart beat and swollen feet. When water accumulates in the body, patients are often advised to limit water intake and follow a low-salt diet...\nMental health\nKidney failure not only affects physical health but also affects mental factors. The more severe the disease, the more the patient's mental health is affected. Some stressors may include:\nFinancial pressure during dialysis; Must adhere to strict dialysis schedule; Feeling like a burden to others; Pain, fatigue, poor sleep, diet; Work is affected",
