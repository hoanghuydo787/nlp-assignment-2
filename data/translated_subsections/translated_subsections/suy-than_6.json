Kidney imaging examination using high-frequency sound waves to evaluate kidney size, structure and regional pathologies resides in the kidney…\nCT computed tomography scan\nComputed tomography (CT) to create images of the inside of the body. This imaging diagnostic method is often used to give doctors an overview of the causes of disease.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nThis method is used to evaluate the patient's kidney failure through symptoms: blood in urine, frequent urinary tract infections, monitoring patients with a history of urinary tract cancer...\nKidney scintigraphy\nRenal scintigraphy is one of the highly valuable diagnostic techniques in evaluating kidney pathology. The role of kidney scintigraphy is to provide information about kidney morphology, function, ability to excrete urine... Kidney scintigraphy is safe for patients who are sensitive to contrast agents, so X-rays cannot be performed. .\nBiopsy\nThis is a method of removing a piece of kidney tissue, under the guidance of imaging diagnostic equipment, to assess kidney condition and the risk of malignant diseases. This method is often performed after other common diagnostic imaging methods.",
