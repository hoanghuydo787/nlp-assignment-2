    "subsection_content": "Artificial blood filtration (hemodialysis)\nArtificial hemodialysis is the use of a machine outside the body to clean waste from the blood instead of kidney function. After purifying all toxins, the blood will be returned to the patient's body. Depending on the type of dialysis, you may be connected to a specialized machine or a portable catheter bag. Indications for hemodialysis are used in cases where patients have complications such as brain dysfunction, increased potassium but do not respond to medical treatment, and creatinine clearance drops below 10ml/min/1.73m2 body. Blood dialysis can be performed regularly 3 times a week at medical facilities. This method brings certain effects to people with kidney failure, but cannot fully perform the role of a healthy kidney. This means that people may still experience some health problems related to this condition, even though they are on dialysis. Currently, dialysis can be performed at medical facilities or at home, if qualified.\nPeritoneal dialysis\nPeritoneal dialysis (PD) is a method of cleaning waste from the blood using the patient's own abdominal lining (called the peritoneum). Peritoneal dialysis is performed using a special solution called dialysate. Peritoneal dialysis can be performed in the hospital, or even at home or work, if the patient can prepare a clean, private room.\nCurrently there are 3 methods of peritoneal dialysis:\nAcute peritoneal dialysis; Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD); Automated peritoneal dialysis (ADP) includes continuous peritoneal dialysis, nocturnal intermittent peritoneal dialysis, and tidal peritoneal dialysis\nDuring peritoneal dialysis, dialysis fluid flows through a tube (catheter) into your abdomen. The abdominal lining acts as a filter and removes waste products from the patient's blood. After a certain period of time, the filtrate with waste products is drained from the abdomen and discarded. These methods can be done at home, work or while traveling. But peritoneal dialysis is not an optimal choice for everyone with kidney failure. Because this method needs to be operated by an experienced person, capable of taking care of the patient at home and with certain equipment.\nKidney transplant\nAnother treatment option for people with kidney failure is a kidney transplant. A healthy kidney is replaced by a kidney that has lost up to 90% of its ability to function normally,  no longer able to filter blood.\nKidney sources for transplantation can be from living kidney donors (relative or non-relative) or brain dead donors. This is considered the best treatment option for people with kidney failure because it can increase the chances of living a longer, healthier life. Patients receive a kidney transplant when their kidneys are near failure, before needing dialysis and can also be used with dialysis while waiting for a kidney transplant.\nKidney transplant surgery is considered safe and has a high success rate. Studies have shown that patients who receive a kidney from a living donor live longer than patients who receive a kidney from a brain-dead donor (someone who has recently passed away). On average, kidney transplants from living donors last 15-20 years and from deceased donors last 10-15 years.\nHowever, when choosing a kidney transplant, the patient may also face some risks such as thrombosis, bleeding, ureteral leakage or blockage, infection, and cancer related to the newly transplanted kidney. donate. In particular, kidney transplant recipients must take immunosuppressive drugs for life after surgery to prevent the body from rejecting the new kidney. These medications have their own side effects and some of them are very serious.\nImplant surgery may not be the right option for everyone. Therefore, patients should talk to their treating doctor for more detailed advice.",
