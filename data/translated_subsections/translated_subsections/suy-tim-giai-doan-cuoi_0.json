Heart failure causes the heart to not function as well as it should and leads to a weakening of the heart; At the same time, it causes other damage to the body over time.

The body also changes, narrowing blood vessels and diverting blood from certain organs. But despite these adjustments, heart failure continues to worsen and eventually, the body will no longer be able to compensate for the loss of blood. At this point, the patient begins to feel tired, have difficulty breathing, and have other problems.\nAlthough treatments can help control symptoms and slow the progression of the disease, some heart failure eventually reaches its final stages. During this stage, the patient feels short of breath even when resting.\nThe severity of symptoms caused by end-stage heart failure can fluctuate over hours or days.",
