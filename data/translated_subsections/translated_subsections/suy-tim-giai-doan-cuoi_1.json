    "subsection_content": "Heart failure is one of the common causes of hospitalization in the elderly. In fact, more than 5 million adults in the US have heart failure. The disease gets worse over time, so that the most severe symptoms appear in the final stages. (2)\n1. Sleep problems\nThe final stage of heart failure makes the patient have difficulty breathing, especially when lying low. This causes the patient to have difficulty sleeping and may have to wake up in the middle of the night to breathe. According to the doctor's advice, the patient should try sleeping in a position leaning on two or more pillows to improve the situation.\n2. Difficulty breathing\nHeart failure makes it difficult for patients to breathe when walking up stairs. With end-stage heart failure, patients have a high rate of shortness of breath when walking short distances or even when sitting still.\n3. Dry cough\nThe patient coughs frequently during the day and the sputum is light pink (may be mixed with blood). End-stage heart failure can make coughing worse, especially when lying down.\n4. Swelling of hands and feet\nWhen the heart cannot send blood throughout the body, blood can accumulate in certain parts. That leads to swelling in the feet, ankles, legs or abdomen. Patients may also gain weight due to fluid retention in these areas. End-stage heart failure makes parts of the body more susceptible to swelling and weight gain.\n5. Eat less\nProgressive heart failure can cause people to not feel hungry and eat less at their meals. Even though the patient eats little, the patient continues to gain weight due to the accumulation of fluid in the body.\n6. Going to the toilet many times\nPeople may have to wake up and urinate more often in the middle of the night when they have end-stage heart failure than when they are healthy. It's a way for the body to increase the elimination of excess fluid.\n7. Heart beats fast\nThe patient feels that his heart beats too fast or too strongly. In the late stages of heart failure, people experience this more often or to a greater degree.\n8. Feeling anxious\nEnd-stage heart failure makes patients worry about their health. Depression or too much anxiety can make heart failure worse. Many signs show that more clearly, such as sweating and difficulty breathing.\n9. Fatigue\nIf before, many activities did not make the patient tired, now the accompanying symptoms of fatigue appear. This is caused by heart failure and it is likely that the patient will always feel tired.\nThis condition makes the patient constantly tired.",
