    "subsection_content": "Heart failure can become chronic and develop over time due to medical conditions, thus causing the heart to become damaged and work harder than usual. In addition, heart failure also has an acute form and develops with conditions that cause sudden heart damage, such as infection, blood clots in the lungs, or myocardial infarction. (3)\nOver time, mild heart disease can progress to the point of requiring medication and intervention with other treatment options, even a heart transplant. When this happens, it means the patient is experiencing end-stage heart failure.\nMany causes contribute to the final stages of the disease, including:\nCoronary artery disease: The coronary arteries supply blood to the heart muscle. If they become clogged or narrowed, blood flow to the myocardium decreases, causing the heart to weaken.; Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: This disease involves weakening of the heart muscle, caused by something other than blockage in the coronary arteries. Possible causes include genetic conditions, medication side effects, and infections.; Heart valve disease, congenital heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and sleep apnea are also causes of heart failure.\nBesides the above causes, many risk factors also cause heart failure to progress to the end stage, including:\nOverweight, obese;; Smoke;; Anemia;; Atrial fibrillation;; Lupus erythematosus;; Diabetes, especially type 2;; Thyroid diseases such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism...; Myocarditis: is an inflammation of the heart muscle that often occurs due to a virus and can lead to left heart failure;; Arrhythmia: fast heart rate or slow heart rate;; Hemochromatosis: condition where iron accumulates in tissues;; Amyloidosis: the deposition of proteins that accumulate in one or more organ systems.",
