    "subsection_content": "To determine end-stage heart failure, your doctor first needs to know about your symptoms and medical history. Some questions will be discussed with the patient, such as:\nWhether other health conditions are present: such as diabetes, kidney disease, chest pain (or angina), high blood pressure, high cholesterol, coronary artery disease or other heart problems; Family history of heart disease or sudden death; Does the patient smoke or drink alcohol? What level?; Have you had or are receiving chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy?; Medications currently in use.\nAfter understanding the information, the doctor will prescribe a number of appropriate paraclinical diagnoses to accurately determine the patient's condition, including:\nElectrocardiogram: to examine abnormal heart rhythm; Blood tests: Your doctor may order these tests to check for infection, evaluate kidney function, and levels of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro B-type Natriuretic Peptide – BNP). BNP is produced by the heart, and is normally present in the blood in very low amounts. If heart failure occurs, the BNP index will increase abnormally; MRI scan: provides high-resolution images of the heart, which can evaluate structural changes and scarring.; Cardiac catheterization: This helps doctors identify blockages in the arteries – one of the most common causes of heart failure. The doctor can check blood flow and pressure levels in the ventricles at the same time.; Echocardiogram: This is an imaging technique that can help doctors identify valvular heart disease, congenital cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease, or some non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. set…\nThe patient had an echocardiogram at Tam Anh General Hospital.",
