    "subsection_content": "Complications become more severe in the late stages of heart failure, including:\nKidney failure: This occurs when blood flow to the kidneys is reduced. If left untreated, the disease will become more severe. The kidneys are damaged due to heart failure, so dialysis is needed for treatment.; Heart valve problems: Heart valves keep blood flowing in the right direction. Because of end-stage heart failure, the heart chambers are enlarged, the pressure in the heart is very high, leading to the heart valves not working normally.; Heart rhythm problems: life-threatening arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, etc. may occur; Liver damage: Heart failure is caused by fluid buildup and this puts a lot of pressure on the liver, making it difficult for the liver to function normally. This condition leads to cirrhosis.",
