    "subsection_content": "When a patient has end-stage heart failure, performing daily activities such as bathing or walking around the house will also become more difficult. The person may be hospitalized for intravenous medications, oxygen therapy, or other interventional treatments. If the condition does not improve upon admission, the person may receive palliative care. (4)\n1. Implantable devices\nThe doctor will perform the procedure of implanting a defibrillator into the patient's chest. This device helps convert the heart to sinus rhythm in case the patient has ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.\n2. Heart transplant\nThis is an invasive procedure to replace the heart with another suitable and healthy heart. After being replaced, the patient also needs to use medication to help the body gradually accept this new heart.\n3. Palliative care\nPalliative care is not necessarily end-of-life care. Palliative care focuses on relieving symptoms and discomfort caused by chronic disease. Many cases continue to be treated with palliative care but focus more on improving the patient's quality of life.",
