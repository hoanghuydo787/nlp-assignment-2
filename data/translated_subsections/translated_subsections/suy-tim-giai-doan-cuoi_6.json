Smoking is one of the risk factors for damaging coronary arteries and leading to heart failure.; Eat a heart-healthy diet that prioritizes foods low in saturated fat, trans fat, sugar or sodium; add fruits, vegetables, low-fat milk, lean protein (chicken) and \"good\" fats such as those found in olive oil, fish, avocados.; Strictly follow the treatment program: People with cardiovascular disease need to have regular check-ups and take medication as prescribed. Recent research shows that a major part of the long-term benefit of statin therapy is preventing heart failure by preventing heart attacks and coronary events.; Try to stay positive: End-stage heart failure is a serious condition and gets worse quickly if anxiety and depression are present. Therefore, controlling stress and creating a comfortable and happy state of mind will help limit the rapid progression of the disease.\nInvested in modern machinery systems such as modern 4D echocardiography and vascular machines, 1.5 - 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging machine, 768-slice MSCT heart and coronary artery imaging system, intervention system Digital background subtraction (DSA) circuit, 360-degree rotating robotic arm... with a team of experienced experts, Tam Anh General Hospital Heart Center successfully treats patients with cardiovascular diseases (heart failure, high blood pressure). pressure, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, myocardial ischemia, congenital heart disease...).
