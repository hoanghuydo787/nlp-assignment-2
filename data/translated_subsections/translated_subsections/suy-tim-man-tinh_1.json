    "subsection_content": "Chronic heart failure affects the lower chambers of the heart (right and left ventricles) and occurs when the heart cannot adapt to the body's changing oxygen needs, for example when exercising or going up and down stairs. .\nThere are different types of chronic heart failure, classified by how the heart responds to pumping blood. There are two main types: Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) and Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF). (2)\nThis condition can also be affected by the combination of HFrEF and HFpEF. Furthermore, each type can affect the left ventricle, the right ventricle, or both at the same time.\n1. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction\nHeart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), also known as systolic heart failure, occurs when the heart is too weak and does not contract normally. This is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by structural and/or functional impairment of the left ventricle, leading to reduced cardiac pumping function (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%), associated with an insufficient supply of oxygen-rich blood to meet the needs of tissues and organs.\nHFrEF is the most common type of heart failure. Although people of any age can develop this type of heart failure, it occurs most often in middle-aged and older people. In the US, HFrEF affects about 3.5 million people, of whom 36% are women. Studies over the past decade have highlighted differences between women and men with HFrEF regarding many aspects of the syndrome, including epidemiology, pathophysiology, outcomes, and treatment.\nWomen with HFrEF have fewer comorbidities, lower hospitalization rates, and better survival than men; but they also experience more symptoms and poorer functional status and health-related quality of life.\n2. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction\nHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), also known as diastolic heart failure, occurs when the heart is too stiff and does not fill with blood normally. Characteristics of HFpEF include symptoms of heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 50%. Heart failure associated with a moderate decrease in LVEF (40% to 49%) is also often included in this group.\nIn the United States, approximately 5 million people have been diagnosed with heart failure at a rate of more than 650,000 new diagnoses each year. Nearly half of heart failure patients have preserved ejection fraction. Risk factors include older age, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), valvular heart disease, and atrial fibrillation.\nThe diagnosis of HFpEF requires clinical symptoms and/or signs of heart failure, as well as evidence of preserved LVEF and diastolic dysfunction. Hypertension, CAD, and valvular heart disease are the most common causes. Identifying other underlying causes can lead to optimal treatment and the best outcomes.\nThe first step in diagnosing HFpEF is to determine the possibility of heart failure and then perform a two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to obtain the most accurate diagnosis.",
