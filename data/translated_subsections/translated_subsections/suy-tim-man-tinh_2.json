(3)\nThe main symptom of left-sided heart failure is shortness of breath, which often gets worse with activity or when lying flat. Coughing may also appear. If the condition affects the right side of the heart, edema, a buildup of fluid that causes swelling of the legs and ankles, is the most common symptom.\nOther symptoms, which can appear regardless of which side of the heart is affected, include:\nTired; Dizziness or lightheadedness; Nausea; Loss of appetite; Constipation; Feeling weak in the legs; Fast heartbeat, even at rest, or irregular heartbeat; Chest pain or angina\nDoctors often classify a person's heart failure according to the severity of the symptoms being experienced.

Patients are arranged into 4 groups:\nGroup I: Physical activity not limited by symptoms.; Group II: Physical activity is slightly limited.
