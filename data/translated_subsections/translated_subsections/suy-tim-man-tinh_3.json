    "subsection_content": "Chronic heart failure has no single cause but is a complication of a variety of other conditions. Each disease affects the heart's ability to pump blood throughout the body.\nOne of the most common conditions that cause chronic heart failure is coronary artery disease. The disease leads to the narrowing of the coronary arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart, depriving the heart of the oxygen it needs to function effectively. Although this is a common complication of coronary artery disease, it does not occur in all cases.\nHypertension is another common cause. This condition puts additional strain on the heart, which over time can cause chronic heart failure. High blood pressure occurs when the artery walls exert a stronger force in the opposite direction, causing the heart to work harder to send blood throughout the body. This leads to increased pressure of blood in the arteries.\nOther possible causes of chronic heart failure include:\nCardiomyopathy; Heart valve disease; Congenital heart disease; Viral infections of the heart muscle, such as myocarditis; Drugs and chemicals including some chemotherapy drugs and cocaine; Drinking too much alcohol; Anemia; Thyroid disease; Due to abnormal heart rhythm and arrhythmia\nArrhythmia is one of the causes of chronic heart failure.",
