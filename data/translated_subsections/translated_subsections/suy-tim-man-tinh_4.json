This is considered the most important tool in diagnosing heart failure.; Electrocardiogram (ECG): Used to test and record heart rhythm and electrical activity.; Chest X-ray: Can provide doctors with images of the heart and fluid buildup, if present; Blood test: To measure BNP or NT-proBNP biomarker levels. Both tend to be elevated in people with heart failure.\nIn some cases, other methods, such as urine tests and MRI scans, may also be used.",
