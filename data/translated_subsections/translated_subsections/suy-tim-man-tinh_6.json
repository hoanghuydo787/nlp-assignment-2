    "subsection_content": "Once diagnosed, people with chronic heart failure will follow their doctor's treatment regimen. In most cases, treatment will include lifestyle and dietary changes, as well as medication.\n1. Change your lifestyle\nLifestyle and dietary changes commonly recommended for patients include:\nQuit smoking: Quit smoking and stay away from environments with lots of cigarette smoke. Doctors can advise on the best methods to stop smoking.; Limit alcohol intake: If a person's chronic heart failure is caused by drinking alcohol, it is best to stop.; Weight loss: To reduce stress on the heart, weight loss is important in overweight people.; Exercise regularly: Exercise can help reduce symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue. However, before starting a new exercise regimen, patients should consult their doctor to learn how to do it correctly and safely.; Limit salt intake: Salt can cause excess water retention in the body. Therefore, by adjusting the amount of salt in the diet can help control the disease. Your doctor will advise you on how much salt you should consume.; Check your weight daily: It is important for people who have been diagnosed with chronic heart failure to check their weight daily. If the patient gains about 2kg within 1-3 days, the patient should contact the doctor. This is a sign of fluid retention and may require intervention.\nA healthy diet can help control chronic heart failure.\n2. Using medicine\nDepending on the patient's type of chronic heart failure, the underlying cause, and the severity of the disease, the doctor will prescribe appropriate medication. In many cases, doctors may combine multiple medications or change medications over time, depending on whether hypertension and left ventricular ejection fraction are controlled. And importantly, whether the affected person still exhibits symptoms.\n3. Other treatment methods\nIn some cases, alternative treatments may be recommended by your doctor. Typically, these methods are used to treat the underlying cause of the disease.\nFor example, implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and pacemakers may be fitted to some people. In some severe cases, surgery to replace or repair the affected heart valve may be used. In other rare cases, doctors may perform a heart transplant or implant a left ventricular assist device.",
