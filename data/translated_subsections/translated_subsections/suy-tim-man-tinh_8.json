    "subsection_content": "Associate Professor, Dr. Pham Nguyen Vinh answers frequently asked questions.\n1. What is the difference between acute and chronic heart failure?\nChronic heart failure is generally a condition that develops gradually over time, while acute heart failure, in most cases, occurs so suddenly that it is considered a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention. instantly. These two conditions share similar symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, fluid retention, and chest pain, but develop at different rates.\n2. What is the relationship between sleep apnea and chronic heart failure?\nSleep apnea, as well as other sleep-related disorders, commonly occurs in people with chronic heart failure. Such conditions can put additional strain on the heart during sleep, making heart failure worse in some people. People with sleep apnea and chronic heart failure should talk to their doctor about various treatment options.\n3. Is chronic heart failure hereditary?\nAlthough it may not be accurate to say that chronic heart failure is genetic, some risk factors that can lead to the condition may be genetic, including coronary artery disease and hypertension. In addition to genetic relatedness, family members also share lifestyle and environmental factors that can lead to disease risk.\n4. Life expectancy of the patient?\nIf treated promptly and properly, the life expectancy of people with chronic heart failure can be improved. The prognosis for this condition also depends greatly on the severity of the underlying cause. However, this is a serious condition that requires lifelong monitoring.\nInvested in modern machinery systems such as modern 4D cardiac and vascular ultrasound machines, 1.5 - 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging machine, 768-slice MSCT of the heart and coronary arteries, DSA coronary angiography system 2 aspects..., Tam Anh General Hospital Heart Center receives and treats patients with cardiovascular diseases (heart failure, hypertension, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, myocardial ischemia, congenital heart disease …).\nTreatment regimens are individualized for each patient, highly effective in improving symptoms and preventing dangerous complications of the disease.\nChronic heart failure remains the only cardiovascular disease with an increasing burden of hospitalization and high treatment costs. The incidence of the disease increases with increasing longevity, with diastolic heart failure predominating in the elderly. Preventing coronary artery disease and controlling risk factors helps prevent heart failure from progressing.",
