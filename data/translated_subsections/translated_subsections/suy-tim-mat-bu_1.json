    "subsection_content": "When the heart's ability to pump blood decreases, a number of changes occur to compensate for the lack of blood supply to the peripheral areas. These changes include left ventricular hypertrophy, development of collateral circulation in ischemic heart diseases, increased heart rate... Thus, heart function is restored. Therefore, most clinical manifestations are masked, and the patient does not feel symptoms. This is compensated heart failure.\nThe basic difference between decompensated heart failure and compensated heart failure is:\nCompensated heart failure Decompensated heart failure Concept When cardiac output is reduced in the early stages of heart failure, it causes a number of structural and functional changes in the cardiac tissues as a means of restoring cardiac output. By the end stages of heart failure, structural and functional changes in cardiac tissues fail to maintain desired cardiac output. Symptoms Patients have no symptoms or very mild symptoms such as grade I dyspnea and mild ankle swelling. Dyspnea on exertion Dyspnea when lying down Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea Fatigue and fainting Cough Edema Treatment Prioritize lifestyle modifications such as quitting smoking, limiting alcohol, avoiding stress and Exercise regularly in combination with treatment as prescribed by your doctor. Prioritize drug treatment along with device implantation and surgical procedures.",
