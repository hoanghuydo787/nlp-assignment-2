    "subsection_content": "The most common cause of decompensated heart failure is the patient's failure to comply with the doctor's treatment regimen. Besides, depending on the type of disease, there will be different causes.\nFor new-onset heart failure, common causes include:\nAcute coronary syndrome, especially heart attack; Acute or progressive heart valve disease; New onset cardiomyopathy; Chronic hypertension; Infectious endocarditis; Myocarditis; Start a pregnancy\nChronic hypertension is a risk factor for new-onset heart failure\nFor previously diagnosed heart failure to become more severe, the causes are often:\nDrink lots of water or eat salty foods: Heart failure causes fluid accumulation in the body. Therefore, drinking too much water will make this condition worse. Meanwhile, consuming too much salt increases blood pressure, which can put a strain on the heart.; Certain medications: including NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), anesthetics, medications to treat diabetes, arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat), high blood pressure, and cancer.; Arrhythmia: This condition causes your heart to beat too fast, too slow, or irregularly. It will hinder the heart's ability to pump blood, increasing the risk of heart failure.; Fever and infection: Inflammation is a major part of the body's immune response. So, a viral or bacterial infection can put a strain on the heart. Endocarditis, myocarditis and pericarditis are diseases that can lead to heart failure.; Drinking alcohol: If you have been diagnosed with heart failure, drinking even small amounts of alcohol can be dangerous because alcohol increases blood pressure.; Pregnancy: In rare cases, pregnancy is the cause of peripartum cardiomyopathy, a form of heart failure that occurs during the third trimester of pregnancy.",
