Tests are usually: (3)\n1. Measure SpO2 index\nThis method measures the oxygen levels in your blood. Normal index ranges from 96-100%. If you have a heart failure level below 96%, it means your organs and cells are not getting enough oxygen to function normally.\n2. Testing\nYour doctor may conduct the following tests:\nBrain natriuretic peptide (NP) test: BNP (Brain natriuretic peptide) and NT-proBNP are substances released into the blood when the lower chambers of the heart are stressed. BNP levels above 450 pg/mL for people under 50 and above 900 pg/mL for people over 50 may be a sign of heart failure.; Electrolytes: This measures the amount of sodium, chloride, and potassium in your blood. An imbalance between the indicators is a sign that you are having heart problems.; Kidney function: Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels show how well your kidneys are working.\n3. Paraclinical\nECG (electrocardiogram): evaluates arrhythmia, size of heart chambers, myocardial ischemia...; Chest X-ray: determine if there is pleural effusion, pericardial effusion...; Echocardiogram (echo): check the size of the heart chambers, myocardial contractility function, heart valve disease...\nPatients are referred for an echocardiogram when there are signs of decompensated heart failure",
