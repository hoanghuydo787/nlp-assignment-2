    "subsection_content": "The goal of any treatment for decompensated heart failure is to stabilize symptoms to prevent further damage to the heart and preserve kidney function. Methods include:\n1. Treatment with medication\nDrugs commonly prescribed by doctors to patients are:\nDiuretics: help reduce kidney volume overload, reduce the burden on the heart, thereby overcoming edema; Vasodilators: reduce venous tone, alleviate respiratory failure; Cardiac drugs: increase the heart's ability to contract; Drugs that improve arrhythmia; Anticoagulants: prevent blood clot formation - the cause of stroke, myocardial infarction...\n2. Surgical intervention\nIf oral medications are not effective in treating decompensated heart failure, on the contrary, the symptoms become more severe, the doctor may consider performing surgery/procedures such as:\nCoronary artery bypass surgery: If the cause of heart failure is due to coronary artery disease, the doctor will choose this method to increase blood flow to the heart.; Heart valve repair/replacement surgery: for patients with decompensated heart failure due to valvular disease.; Pacemaker implantation (CTR): helps stabilize heart rhythm, preventing the disease from getting worse; Implantation of a defibrillator: This machine is responsible for adjusting the heart rhythm back to normal if an abnormality in the rhythm or cardiac arrest is detected.; Ventricular assist device: This device is implanted in the chest and abdomen, helping the heart pump blood more effectively.; Heart transplant: When heart failure becomes severe and no other treatment is effective, doctors will consider heart replacement for the patient.\n3. Change your lifestyle\nBesides medication and surgical intervention, patients need to practice a scientific lifestyle to help improve disease symptoms:\nPlan a heart-healthy diet: Increase green vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and good fats in your diet; Cut down on salt (less than 1.5g/day), sweets and foods high in bad fats.; Spend at least 30 minutes/day exercising. You should practice light exercises, then gradually increase the intensity of exercise depending on your ability.; Stay away from tobacco (both active smoking and passive smoking).; Get fully vaccinated to prevent infectious diseases; Regular cardiovascular health check-ups: at least once a year or when unusual symptoms appear.",
