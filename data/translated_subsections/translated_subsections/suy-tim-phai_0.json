In other words, the right ventricle is weakened, causing it to not pump enough blood to the lungs. This disease often occurs when the left ventricle weakens, losing its ability to pump blood to the rest of the body. Or it can be due to a number of diseases, including pulmonary hypertension due to many causes, right ventricular cardiomyopathy and valvular heart disease...
