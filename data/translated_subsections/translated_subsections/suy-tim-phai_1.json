    "subsection_content": "These two types of heart failure have the following differences:\nRight heart failure: The right ventricle transports oxygen-poor blood from the heart back to the lungs to be oxygenated. When the right heart fails, the right ventricle has a reduced ability to pump. That means the heart cannot pump blood to the pulmonary arteries well and blood will stagnate in the veins. If this causes swelling in the feet, ankles, lower legs, and abdomen; Left-sided heart failure: Oxygen-rich blood is carried by the heart from the lungs to the left atrium, then to the left ventricle to pump blood to the rest of the body. The left ventricle accounts for the most working capacity of the heart, so it is larger than the other chambers and is necessary for normal function. In left heart failure, the left ventricle cannot pump enough blood to the body.",
