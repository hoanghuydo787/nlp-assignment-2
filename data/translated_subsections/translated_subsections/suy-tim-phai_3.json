    "subsection_content": "There are many causes of right heart failure, most of which are due to the patient having previously had left heart failure. (3)\n1. Left heart failure\nLeft heart failure is the first cause of right heart failure. When the left ventricle does not function effectively, blood flow pressure increases and eventually stagnates in the lungs. This can overload the right side of the heart. As a result, when the right side cannot pump blood effectively, blood will stagnate in the veins, leading to swelling.\n2. Chronic lung disease\nIncludes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary embolism, and other causes of pulmonary hypertension. High pressure in the pulmonary artery increases the workload of the right ventricle. Over time, the right ventricle may not pump blood as well as it should.\n3. Heart attack\nA heart attack is a blockage of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Myocardial infarction can cause left heart failure leading to right heart failure; or it can directly cause right heart failure due to blocked blood supply to the right ventricle (right ventricular myocardial infarction).\n4. Tricuspid valve stenosis\nTricuspid valve stenosis is a condition in which the tricuspid valve narrows. This limits blood flow out of the right atrium, causing the right atrium to dilate and pool blood in the peripheral veins.\n5. Tricuspid valve regurgitation\nThe tricuspid valve does not close properly, also known as tricuspid regurgitation. This causes blood in the right ventricle to flow back into the right atrium and causes volume overload of the right ventricle. Over time, this can cause the right ventricle to dilate and weaken.\n6. Pericardial spasm\nSurrounding the heart is a membrane sac. Repeated or continuous inflammation will cause stiffness and thickening. Thickening of the heart membrane limits the heart's ability to pump blood effectively.\n7. Congenital heart defects\nCongenital heart defects are also a cause of right-sided heart failure. Some types of congenital heart defects can cause abnormal blood flow in the heart and weaken the right ventricle.\nMany causes lead to this disease, the most common of which is left heart failure.",
