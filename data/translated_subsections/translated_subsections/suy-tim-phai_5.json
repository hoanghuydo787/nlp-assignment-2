    "subsection_content": "Diagnosis of right heart failure usually requires a thorough physical examination by a cardiologist. The doctor also needs to understand your medical history and perform appropriate tests. When reviewing your health history, you may be diagnosed with right heart failure if you have ever had deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.\nSome methods for diagnosing right heart failure include:\nBlood tests: Blood tests measure elevated substances in people with heart failure, and check kidney, liver, and thyroid function; Check for signs of other diseases that can affect the heart; Echocardiogram: Uses ultrasound waves to record moving images of the heart chambers and valves.\nEchocardiogram patient at Tam Anh General Hospital.\nChest X-ray: A common imaging evaluation to view the heart and lungs. A chest X-ray can show whether the lungs are congested or the heart is enlarged.; CT scan: The doctor will obtain detailed images of the heart to determine the condition of the heart.; Cardiac catheterization: A long, thin flexible tube is threaded through a blood vessel in the arm or groin and then up to the heart. Contrast is injected through the catheter and a type of X-ray film is used to show blockages in the heart. This method can be performed along with coronary angiography.; Coronary angiogram: During cardiac catheterization, a contrast dye (visible on X-ray film) will be injected into the heart chambers or coronary arteries. This medication allows your doctor to examine blood flow through your heart and blood vessels to detect any blockages. This method can be performed along with cardiac catheterization.; Electrocardiogram (ECG): The heart's electrical currents are detected by electrodes attached to the arms, legs, and chest. This method can help determine whether parts of the heart are dysfunctional or overworked.; Myocardial biopsy: A long, thin flexible catheter is threaded through a blood vessel in the arm, groin, or neck into the heart to remove a small piece of heart muscle. This heart tissue is looked at under a microscope to determine whether cardiomyopathy is causing right heart failure.; Lung function test: The patient needs to breathe into a tube connected to a measuring device. The device will show how air enters and leaves the patient's lungs.; Exercise electrocardiogram: The patient will be asked to exercise to make the heart work harder and beat faster. If the patient cannot exercise, medication will be given to increase the heart rate. This method is used in conjunction with an electrocardiogram and helps show changes to heart rate as well as blood pressure.",
