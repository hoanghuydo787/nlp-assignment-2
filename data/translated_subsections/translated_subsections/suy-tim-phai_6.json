    "subsection_content": "According to MSc Vo Anh Minh, depending on the cause, the doctor will provide an appropriate treatment regimen for right heart failure. Although not all causes of right heart failure can be cured, people can improve their symptoms. Usually, a combination of lifestyle changes, medication use, and use of cardiac support devices will help patients better control heart failure.\n1. Change your lifestyle\nLifestyle changes can help improve a person's symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. People with mild right heart failure need to do the following:\nQuit smoking; Limit the use of alcohol and coffee; Design a suitable, heart-healthy diet; Sleep a lot at night; Follow sexual activity guidelines for people with heart failure; You can practice yoga and meditation to ensure mental comfort and no stress\n2. Using medicine\nPatients use medication to treat right heart failure, improve heart function, and treat symptoms related to heart rate, high blood pressure, and fluid accumulation. Using medicine helps the body:\nLimit water retention and electrolyte loss; Opens narrowed blood vessels to improve blood flow; Stabilize heart rate and blood pressure; Increase blood flow throughout the body and reduce swelling; Limit fluid retention by urinating more; Prevent blood clots; Reduce cholesterol.\nSpecific medications prescribed by doctors to treat right heart failure include:\nBeta blockers: Helps slow down the heart rate so the heart doesn't work too hard; Diuretics: Helps eliminate sodium and excess fluid in the body.; Pulmonary vasodilators: These drugs relax the blood vessels connected to the heart and lungs.; Digoxin: Increases the heart's ability to pump blood; Vasodilators: Dilate blood vessels and block chemicals that weaken the heart.\n3. Types of devices to support the treatment of right heart failure\nBesides medication, doctors can use devices to help treat right heart failure such as:\nImplantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD); Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) – a type of pacemaker; Left ventricular assist device (LVAD)\nPatients with right heart failure need to be examined and treated early.\n4. Surgery\nIf medication is not effective in controlling and treating right heart failure or severe symptoms occur, the patient may need a ventricular assist device or heart transplant.\nVentricular assist device (VAD): This device can be implanted to help people with weak hearts pump blood more effectively.\nHeart transplant surgery: The damaged heart is surgically replaced with a healthy heart from a donor.",
