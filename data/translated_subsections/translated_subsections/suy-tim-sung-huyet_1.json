    "subsection_content": "According to Dr. Duong Thi Nguyet Anh, Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, left heart failure is the most common type. The disease occurs when the left ventricle does not pump blood to the organs properly. As the disease progresses, fluid can accumulate in the lungs, causing difficulty breathing.\nThere are two types of left heart failure:\nSystolic heart failure: occurs when the left ventricle is too weak, cannot contract normally and does not pump enough blood out.; Diastolic heart failure (or diastolic dysfunction): occurs when the muscle in the left ventricle becomes stiff, causing the heart to lose its ability to relax. Therefore, the heart cannot fill with blood between beats.\nIn addition to left heart failure, there is another type of congestive heart failure called right heart failure. This condition occurs when the right ventricle has difficulty pumping blood to the lungs. Blood accumulates in blood vessels, leading to fluid retention in the abdomen and lower limbs and a number of other important organs.\nSometimes, patients have left heart failure and right heart failure at the same time. Usually, the disease starts on the left side and then reaches the right side when not treated promptly.",
