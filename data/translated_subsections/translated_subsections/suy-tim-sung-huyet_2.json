That means you're at high risk for congestive heart failure because you have one or more of the following risk factors:\nHypertension; Diabetes; Coronary artery disease; Metabolic syndrome; History of alcohol abuse; History of rheumatic fever; Family history of cardiomyopathy; History of taking drugs that can affect the heart muscle, such as some cancer drugs\nPhase B\nAt this stage, your doctor has made a diagnosis of left ventricular systolic dysfunction but you have not yet shown symptoms of congestive heart failure. Most people with stage B heart failure have an echocardiogram (echo) that shows an ejection fraction (EF) of 40% or less.\nPhase C\nPeople with stage C congestive heart failure have begun to show symptoms such as:\nShort of breath; Feeling tired; Reduced ability to exercise; Weak legs; Frequent nocturia; Swelling and edema appear in the feet, ankles, legs and abdomen\nPhase D\nPeople with stage D congestive heart failure have progressive symptoms that do not improve despite treatment.
