    "subsection_content": "Congestive heart failure can result from other health conditions that directly affect the cardiovascular system. This is why you need regular health checks to detect cardiovascular risks early, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, and heart valve disease. (3)\n1. High blood pressure\nWhen your blood pressure is higher than normal, it can lead to congestive heart failure. There are many causes of high blood pressure. The most common of these is arteriosclerosis, which increases pressure in the arteries.\nPeople with high blood pressure are at risk of other cardiovascular diseases.\n2. Coronary artery disease\nCholesterol and other types of fat cause atherosclerosis, which clogs coronary arteries - small arteries that supply blood to the heart. This causes the arteries to become narrow, restricting blood flow and can lead to damage within the artery.\nSee more information about coronary artery disease here.\n3. Heart valve disease\nHeart valves regulate blood flow through the heart by opening and closing properly to let blood in and out of the chambers. When the valve does not open and close correctly (valvular heart disease), the ventricles will have to work harder to pump blood, gradually causing damage to the ventricles leading to congestive heart failure.\n4. Other diseases\nIn addition to cardiovascular diseases, there are other conditions and diseases that also increase the risk, including:\nDiabetes; Thyroid disease; Overweight – obesity; Severe infections and allergic reactions",
