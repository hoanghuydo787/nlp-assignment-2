    "subsection_content": "If not treated promptly and properly, congestive heart failure will seriously affect most organs in the body, leading to complications such as: (4)\n1. Abnormal heart rhythm\nWhen the heart has difficulty pumping blood, it causes arrhythmia, which is an irregular heartbeat. Normally, the atria and ventricles contract in harmony to send blood through the heart and lungs to pick up oxygen, which then delivers blood to the rest of the body through the arteries. When there is arrhythmia, the heart chambers do not function well, affecting the heart's ability to circulate oxygen-rich blood.\nIn addition to not pumping blood properly, arrhythmia can also cause blood circulation to stop, increasing the risk of blood clots. This blood clot has the ability to travel to the brain, leading to a stroke.\n2. Liver and kidney damage\nMajor organs such as the liver and kidneys rely on a steady flow of blood. When these organs do not receive a regular blood supply, their ability to perform vital functions is hindered, including filtering waste and removing toxins from the body.\nOver time, inadequate blood supply causes permanent damage to the kidneys or liver.\n3. Impaired lung function\nWhen you have this disease, the heart cannot get blood in and out of the lungs quickly. This allows blood to return to the lungs, adding pressure to the blood vessels in the lungs and causing fluid to build up in the air sacs (pulmonary edema). This is the reason why patients have difficulty breathing.\n4. Loss of energy\nBecause the heart cannot provide enough oxygen, you become weak and unable to participate in any strenuous activity.",
