    "subsection_content": "When you have signs of congestive heart failure, your doctor will first check your general health and listen to your heart with a stethoscope to detect abnormal heart rhythms or murmurs. After that, your doctor may ask you to perform some laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis such as:\n1. Blood test\nBlood tests help detect abnormal blood cells and infections. This method includes testing blood counts, kidney function and liver function. Your doctor may also check your levels of NT-proBNP, a hormone that increases when you have heart failure.\n2. Chest X-ray\nA chest X-ray is performed to evaluate the size of the heart as well as the amount of fluid accumulated in the lungs and blood vessels.\n3. Electrocardiogram\nAn electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) helps accurately record heart rhythm. Irregularities in your heart rhythm, such as a fast or irregular heartbeat, may indicate that the walls of your heart's chambers are thicker than normal. This is a warning sign of a heart attack.\n4. Echocardiography\nAn echocardiogram uses sound waves to record the structure and movement of the heart. Thanks to this, the doctor will determine whether you have heart valve disease, congenital heart disease, dilated heart chambers, damaged heart muscle or normal heart muscle contractions.\n5. Stress echocardiography\nStress tests will show how your heart works at different levels of exertion.\n6. Cardiac catheterization\nThis method checks the degree of blockage of the coronary arteries, blood flow and pressure in the heart chambers.\n7. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nAn MRI scan helps doctors check whether there is damage to the heart or not.",
