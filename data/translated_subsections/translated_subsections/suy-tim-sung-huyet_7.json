ARBs are an alternative if you cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors.; Beta blockers: reduce the burden on the heart, while lowering blood pressure and regulating tachycardia.; Diuretics: reduce the amount of fluid in your body (the disease can cause the body to store more fluid than usual).\nSurgical treatment\nIf medical treatments don't work, you may need an interventional procedure, such as:\nCoronary angioplasty: a procedure to widen blocked coronary arteries.; Heart valve repair surgery: helps the valve open and close properly.; Heart transplant: replacing a failing heart with a donor heart. This method is often applied to patients with end-stage congestive heart failure.",
