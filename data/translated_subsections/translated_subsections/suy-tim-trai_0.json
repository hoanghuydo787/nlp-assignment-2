    "subsection_content": "Left heart failure is a disease that occurs when the contractile function of the left ventricle decreases. Over time, this condition can cause the heart to weaken and no longer be able to process blood received from the lungs.\nLeft-sided heart failure is divided into 2 types: (1)\nSystolic heart failure: the left ventricle's contraction and ejection function is too weak, unable to pump blood out to the aorta to nourish the body's organs. This form is also known as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; Diastolic heart failure: The left ventricle becomes stiff, less elastic and cannot relax properly, making it difficult to pump blood back into the ventricle. This form is also known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.\nThe heart has two main pumping chambers: the right ventricle and the left ventricle. These two chambers work in different ways to pump blood:\nLeft chamber: Receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and delivers it to the rest of the body. Oxygen helps organs, muscles and tissues fulfill their roles.; Right chamber: Receives oxygen-poor blood returning from organs, bringing it to the lungs to get more oxygen.\nSee more: What is heart failure?",
