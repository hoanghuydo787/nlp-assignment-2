    "subsection_content": "According to MSc. Huynh Thanh Kieu, left ventricular failure occurs due to many potential causes, such as:\nHypertension: Chronic hypertension is one of the most common causes of diastolic heart failure. When you have high blood pressure for a long time, your heart has to work harder to pump blood throughout your body. As a result, the heart becomes thicker and harder. This affects the ability to relax between beats.; Diabetes: High blood sugar causes hardening of blood vessels. This condition causes the heart to work harder and causes the muscles to thicken.; Coronary artery disease: Blockage of the coronary arteries causes less blood to reach the heart muscle. Very low blood flow to the heart can cause heart muscle cells to die (or ischemia), preventing the heart from relaxing and filling with blood as it should.; Pericarditis: This is an inflammatory condition of the pericardium - the thin membrane surrounding the heart, leading to a limitation of the heart's ability to fill with blood.; Sedentary lifestyle: Lack of physical activity increases the risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, coronary artery disease and obesity. All of these factors contribute to diastolic heart failure.; Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): When you have OSA, you stop breathing during sleep. This leads to a complex series of changes in the body, including increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen supply to the heart and increased nervous system activity. These changes cause a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand, putting you at higher risk for systolic heart failure, diastolic heart failure as well as other cardiovascular diseases.\nIn addition, systolic heart failure and diastolic heart failure have different root causes. Systolic dysfunction is often due to: (2)\nIdiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy; Coronary artery disease; High blood pressure; Heart valve disease; Congenital heart disease\nDiastolic dysfunction is often due to:\nHigh Blood Pressure; Fat; Coronary artery disease; Cardiomyopathy; Pericardial disease; Diabetes; Atrial fibrillation; Sleep apnea syndrome\nObesity and sleep apnea are risk factors for left heart failure",
