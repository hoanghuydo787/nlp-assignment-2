Next, the doctor conducts an electrocardiogram, cardiopulmonary X-ray, echocardiogram to evaluate the structure and function of the left ventricle, and blood tests for biomarkers of heart failure.\nThe doctor will carefully ask you about your history of high blood pressure, diabetes, dyslipidemia, drinking habits, smoking habits, angina symptoms or history of myocardial infarction, and symptoms of shortness of breath. or previous history of heart failure, valvular heart disease or arrhythmia; During the examination, the doctor will pay attention to symptoms of heart failure such as difficulty breathing, wheezing, labored breathing, shortness of breath, enlarged jugular veins in the neck, leg swelling, enlarged liver or ascites. Listening to the heart may reveal an abnormal murmur, rapid or irregular heartbeat. Listening to the lungs, there may be many whistling sounds on both sides of the lungs or signs of suspected water in the lungs.; The first basic paraclinical tests to do are: Electrocardiography: signs of enlarged heart chambers, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia or signs of myocardial ischemia or previous myocardial infarction. Chest X-ray: shows an enlarged heart shadow, congestion in the lungs or fluid in the lungs. Blood tests measure indicators of heart failure (BNP/or NT-ProBNP, sST2...): these substances are elevated in heart failure. Echocardiography: provides much necessary information for diagnosis and treatment. Echocardiography shows whether there is valvular heart disease, myocardial ischemia or old myocardial infarction scars (areas of heart muscle with reduced movement or motionlessness, no contraction), the size of the heart chambers, and the ability to contract. myocardial contraction (ejection fraction), pulmonary artery pressure, thrombus in the heart chamber, fluid around the pericardium... Based on the results of echocardiography to classify heart failure, when the ejection fraction decreases slightly greater than or equal to 40%, it is called heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (systolic heart failure), if the ejection fraction is greater than or equal to 50%, it is called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (diastolic heart failure). .
