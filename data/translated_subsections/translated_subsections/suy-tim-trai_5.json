The ultimate goal is to improve heart function, improve quality of life, reduce hospitalizations for heart failure and prolong patient life, M.D. Huynh Thanh Kieu emphasized. (3)\nBasic treatment measures in left heart failure include:\nNon-drug treatment: Changes in lifestyle, diet, work, and cardiovascular rehabilitation exercises need to be made throughout the treatment process.
