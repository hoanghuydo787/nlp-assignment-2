    "subsection_content": "Clinically, there are many ways to classify heart failure. These classifications help doctors direct treatment for each case. (3)\n1. Left heart failure\nPatients with left heart failure have symptoms of pulmonary congestion such as fatigue, shortness of breath that increases with exertion or when lying down, dry cough, coughing up blood, etc.\n2. Right heart failure\nPatients with right heart failure have symptoms of peripheral blood stasis such as leg edema, enlarged liver, ascites, distended neck veins, etc.\n3. Complete heart failure\nThere are symptoms of both types of heart failure mentioned above.\n4. Acute heart failure\nAcute heart failure causes severe difficulty breathing, acute pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock. Symptoms are acute, the patient must be hospitalized in the emergency room for timely treatment. If delayed, life can be dangerous.\n5. Chronic heart failure\nSymptoms of chronic heart failure occur gradually or the patient has a history of acute heart failure, but now the heart failure has improved and is stable.\n6. Systolic heart failure (or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction)\nThe heart has the function of contracting and pumping blood to the aorta and its branches to feed the organs in the body. The heart's ability to contract is also known as ejection fraction, which is assessed through ultrasound or cardiac catheterization. Normal ejection fraction > 55%. When the cardiac contractile function is reduced and the ejection fraction is ≤ 40%, it is called heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.\n7. Diastolic heart failure (or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction)\nIn addition to the function of pumping blood, the heart also has the function of sucking blood from the veins back to the heart. When the heart relaxes during diastole (rest period) with negative pressure in the chest, blood from the veins will flow to the heart to start a new contraction cycle. When the heart muscle thickens or stiffens and no longer expands well to accommodate blood, it will cause diastolic dysfunction.\nThe patient has typical symptoms of the disease (fatigue, shortness of breath, leg swelling), on ultrasound the preserved ejection fraction is > 50%, the left ventricle is thickened, there is diastolic dysfunction with increased markers of Heart failure in the blood (BNP or NT-ProBNP) is diagnosed as diastolic heart failure.\nSee more: What is decompensated heart failure?\nIn addition, the heart failure staging systems of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) are also frequently used by doctors.",
