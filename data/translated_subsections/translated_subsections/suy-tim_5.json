However, with treatment, signs and symptoms may improve, and sometimes the heart becomes stronger and heart function recovers. Proper treatment can help patients have a better quality of life, live longer and reduce the risk of sudden death. (4)\nIn almost every case of treating this disease, doctors will use a combination of drugs or supporting devices.\nTreatment medicine\nTo treat heart failure, doctors will combine different medications depending on the symptoms, stage and cause of the disease. Some drugs used in treatment include:\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors:  these drugs are effective for people with heart failure. The drug mechanism helps dilate blood vessels to lower blood pressure, improve blood flow and reduce the workload on the heart. in all stages of the disease.; Angiotensin II receptor blockers: this group of drugs can be used as an alternative for patients who are intolerant to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; Beta blockers: this is a group of drugs that help slow heart rate, lower blood pressure, prevent and treat tachyarrhythmias, improve heart function and prevent sudden death.; Diuretics: this medicine helps patients urinate more often, limits water retention in the body, especially in the lungs, helping patients breathe easily.; Aldosterone antagonists: these are potassium-sparing diuretics, which reduce myocardial fibrosis and prolong the patient's life.; Inotropic drugs: are intravenous drugs used for people with severe heart failure in the hospital to improve the heart's pumping function and maintain blood pressure. However, this medicine does not help prolong the patient's life; Digoxin (Lanoxin): this drug helps increase the strength of heart muscle contractions, especially indicated in patients with heart failure accompanied by atrial fibrillation.\nIn almost every treatment case, doctors will use a combination of drugs or supportive devices\nMedication regimens can be used in combination depending on the patient's condition. In addition, some other medications, such as nitrates, can be used to reduce angina, statins to lower cholesterol, or blood thinners to help prevent clots. Blood clots... can be used depending on the medical condition.\nSurgery\nIn some cases, doctors recommend surgery to treat the cause of heart failure such as heart valve surgery if heart failure is due to heart valve disease, coronary artery bypass surgery if heart failure is due to coronary artery stenosis, surgery to repair the disease. congenital heart disease or arrhythmia ablation treatment\nSome treatments being researched and used in some people include implantable left ventricular resynchronization device (CRT), implantable automated defibrillator (ICD), left ventricular assist device (LVAD), heart transplant, and most recently, total artificial heart replacement. These techniques are only applied in large hospitals by highly qualified doctors.\nAutomated defibrillator (ICD): used for patients with reduced ejection fraction < 35%, helps prevent sudden death due to ventricular arrhythmia. When the heart is in ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, the machine will emit an electric current like an electric shock to stop the arrhythmia and bring the heart rhythm back to normal.; Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT): used in patients with reduced ejection fraction and wide QRS complexes on the electrocardiogram. This machine will help the two ventricles contract more synchronously, improving heart function and heart failure symptoms of the patient.; Ventricular assist devices (VADs): these are mechanical circulatory support devices that act as an implantable mechanical pump that pumps blood from the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles) to the rest of the heart. body. VADs are implanted in the abdomen or chest and attached to the heart to help it pump blood to the rest of the body.; Heart transplant: In cases of end-stage disease that does not respond to the above treatment measures, it is necessary to be included in the heart transplant registration list.
