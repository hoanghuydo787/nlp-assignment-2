    "subsection_content": "Heart failure is an extremely dangerous disease and leads to many complications that can reduce a person's quality of life and lifespan.\nReduced quality of life: sick people cannot work or even take care of themselves. Patients with end-stage heart failure need constant support from caregivers.; Arrhythmia: Patients are susceptible to atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmia. Atrial fibrillation worsens the condition by reducing the amount of blood the heart pumps out by 20%, in addition to increasing the risk of ischemic stroke due to blood clots from the heart traveling to the brain. Patients with severe heart failure often have ventricular premature beats, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, causing sudden death if a defibrillator is not placed in advance.; Death and sudden death: end-stage severe heart failure that does not respond to medical treatment without placement of a cardiac support device or heart transplant will lead to death. Sudden death is also a complication that can occur in patients with stages C and D, even when symptoms of heart failure are not too severe.\nSee more: How long can people with heart failure live?
