    "subsection_content": "Chronic venous insufficiency is a condition in which the venous valves will \"not close tightly\", causing part of the oxygen-poor blood to \"flow back\" to the legs and stagnate there with each cardiac cycle. In the body, the heart plays the role of bringing \"oxygen-rich\" blood to the organs through arteries, while veins bring \"oxygen-poor\" blood back to the heart to continue the body's infinite circulation. (first)\nThe farther away the veins are, the slower blood returns to the heart, especially the veins in the legs. Blood in the leg veins is more likely to \"stall\" because most of the time during the day we are in a sitting or standing position. Veins have many one-way valves distributed along their path. Venous valves help blood \"climb step by step\" in one direction to the heart. The valves also help prevent blood stasis in distant parts of the body.\nOver time, sometimes taking years to decades, chronic venous insufficiency progresses silently and gradually causes symptoms of pain, cramps, numbness, edema and changes in color in the legs. Over time, if not treated properly, it can progress to foot ulcers that do not heal.",
