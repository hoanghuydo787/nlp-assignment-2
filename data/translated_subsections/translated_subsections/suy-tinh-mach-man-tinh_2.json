    "subsection_content": "Symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency are often localized in the legs, from the feet to the calves in the early stages or the thighs in the later stages: (3)\nSwelling or heaviness in the legs, especially in the lower legs and ankles; Painful; Itchy; Numbness; Varicose veins (tiny spider veins on the surface of the skin, or tortuous varicose veins); Dark, hard skin\nSymptoms of venous disease will often be \"more intense\" in the afternoon or at bedtime. Symptoms will decrease when raising the legs or some patients even want to \"hang their legs\" high to sleep because they will \"sleep better\". That's because when the legs are higher than the heart, the blood in the legs will \"flow\" better to the heart, helping to relieve symptoms of tension caused by blood stagnation in the leg veins.\nIf not treated early, the pressure created by blood stagnation in the veins for a long time will break small blood vessels in the legs, causing the skin to turn dark brown, especially the skin on the lower legs near the ankles. More serious is swelling and leg ulcers that take a long time to heal, are easily infected, and are difficult to treat.",
