    "subsection_content": "Chronic venous insufficiency can lead to serious complications such as:\nVenous ulcers\nPoor blood circulation to the heart in the legs is the root cause of leg ulcers. These ulcers are not only unsightly but also painful and slow to heal. Even with proper treatment, it can take several months for them to completely disappear. On the contrary, if the patient does not keep the ulcerated skin area clean during treatment, the ulcers will quickly become infected. At that time, the doctor must widen the wound to remove infected tissue and prevent more serious complications.\nBlood clot\nWhen the veins of the lower extremities are impaired, the blood flow to the heart will go very slowly, creating an opportunity for blood clots to form. That's why chronic venous insufficiency is sometimes associated with deep vein thrombosis. This condition develops when a blood clot forms in one of the deep veins in the leg. These clots can block blood flow to the legs and even block a pulmonary embolism, causing a pulmonary embolism (when part of a blood clot in the leg breaks off and travels to the lungs). If not treated early, the blood clot will block the arteries in the lungs, reducing oxygen exchange, leading to death.\nSymptoms of a pulmonary embolism include coughing up blood, chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, low blood pressure, and rapid heart rate. If you have symptoms that suggest a pulmonary embolism, go to the hospital immediately.\nBleeding is difficult to stop\nCirculatory problems can affect the body's ability to heal wounds. That means if you have chronic venous insufficiency and have an open wound on your leg, you are at risk of bleeding a lot and must take intensive care to stop the bleeding. Otherwise, uncontrolled blood loss will be life-threatening.\nIn addition, some people with chronic venous insufficiency also face bleeding naturally. The cause is venous ulcers or venous hemorrhage. Regardless of the cause of bleeding, the patient needs to see a doctor for timely treatment.",
