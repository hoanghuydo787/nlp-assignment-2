    "subsection_content": "If you have severe chronic venous insufficiency, your doctor will consider a number of procedures to remove diseased veins to redirect blood flow to other healthy veins. Some treatments being routinely performed at the Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital are:\nSclerotherapy: the doctor will inject medicine into the spider veins under the skin. Thanks to that, blood no longer follows the diseased veins. Over time, veins will become fibrous, turn into scars and no longer appear on the skin.; Endovascular laser ablation: the doctor will insert a heating wire (laser or radiofrequency wire) into the vein and conduct heat wave heating to destroy the diseased vein. This is a new method being widely applied in major centers around the world with high aesthetics and treatment effectiveness, low recurrence rate, and moderate cost.; Venaseal intravenous glue injection: This is a modern method highly appreciated for its convenience and speed. The procedure is performed with anesthesia so the patient will be completely awake throughout the treatment process. The doctor inserts a tool into the diseased vein to inject glue to \"adhere\" the vein. Blood will no longer follow that vein but will be directed to another healthy vein.\nDoctor performs glue injection to treat chronic varicose veins of the lower limbs.",
