Each adrenal gland is composed of two parts: the adrenal cortex (outer part) and the adrenal medulla (inner part). Cells in different areas of the adrenal gland make different hormones. For example, the adrenal cortex produces the hormones cortisol and aldosterone. The adrenal medulla produces the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. Adrenal hormones have the function of supporting blood sugar control, maintaining stable blood pressure, and balancing sodium and electrolytes; response to stress. (first)",
