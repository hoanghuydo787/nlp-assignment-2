    "subsection_content": "1. Primary adrenal insufficiency\nThe most common cause of primary AI is an autoimmune disease, meaning the body's defense system attacks and destroys the body's own tissues. When the adrenal glands are damaged, they cannot produce the hormones orthosterone and aldosterone. Other causes of primary AI include: bleeding in the glands, infections, hereditary (inherited) diseases, and adrenalectomy. (3)\n2. Secondary adrenal insufficiency\nSecondary adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which the pituitary gland does not produce enough of the hormone ACTH (adrenocorticotropin), causing the adrenal glands to not produce enough cortisol. Causes of secondary adrenal insufficiency include: pituitary adenoma, pituitary gland removed or treated with radiation, parts of the hypothalamus removed, metastatic cancer of the adrenal gland...\nA common cause in Vietnam is also due to prolonged use of corticosteroids, often in patients with asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.\nThe cause of adrenal insufficiency in Vietnam is also due to prolonged use of corticosteroids, commonly found in patients with asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.",
