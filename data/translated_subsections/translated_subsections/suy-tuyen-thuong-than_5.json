However, in general, people with adrenal insufficiency are treated with hormone drugs (glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids) to replace the hormones that the adrenal glands cannot produce. In specific situations, the doctor will have coordinated instructions to control health well.\nMost people with adrenal insufficiency must take hormone replacement therapy for the rest of their lives, but in some recovery cases hormone replacement therapy can be stopped.\n1. Hormone replacement\nPatients with adrenal insufficiency are given hormones to replace them, mainly the cortisol group. If you have Addison's disease, you may need to take aldosterone. Hormone replacement usually begins with intravenous (intravenous) fluids and corticosteroid medication. Your doctor will adjust the dosage of each medication to meet your body's needs. During treatment, if the patient is stressed, they often cannot tolerate oral corticosteroids, so intramuscular injections must be used.\n2. Other treatment\nDepending on the specific case, the doctor will have a different regimen for each patient. However, patients need to pay attention to:\nPatients should remember to take the medicine regularly. If they stop taking the medicine, they will easily fall into acute adrenal failure, which is life-threatening.; Patients must know how to adjust the dose in situations, for example, when the body is under stress such as illness, diarrhea, infection... At the same time, increase the dose according to the doctor's instructions.; Regular check-ups for doctors to adjust dosage and screen for complications related to side effects of long-term corticosteroid use (can cause osteoporosis, diabetes)...\n3. Other serious injury or condition\nIf there is severe injury (unconsciousness, coma), people with adrenal insufficiency need higher doses of corticosteroids. Usually, your doctor will inject corticosteroids into your veins. As you recover, your doctor will adjust your dose back to normal, pre-injury levels.\nPatients with adrenal insufficiency are treated with hormone medications to replace the hormones that the adrenal glands cannot produce.",
