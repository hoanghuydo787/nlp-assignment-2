    "subsection_content": "Arteries carry blood rich in oxygen and nutrients from the heart to the head and body. There are two carotid arteries and two vertebral arteries (front and back of the neck)  that supply blood to the brain. Although the brain accounts for only 2% of the body's weight, it receives 15% of cardiac output and 25% of the total oxygen supply to the body.\nNormally, from the age of 30 onwards, the arteries supplying blood to the brain accumulate plaques (fat and cholesterol), the arteries will gradually narrow and reduce blood flow to the brain. . The larger the plaque, the harder it is for blood to reach the brain. At some point, the plaque will completely block the blood vessel or sometimes the plaque will crack, forming a blood clot, blocking the blood vessels in the brain. In addition, blood vessels in the brain can also be blocked by thrombosis - a blood clot from another place, such as from the heart or leg, following the bloodstream to a smaller blood vessel, blocking the small blood vessel. This condition will lead to a stroke and is called a cerebral embolism stroke.\nAtherosclerotic plaques can lead to cerebral vascular occlusion",
