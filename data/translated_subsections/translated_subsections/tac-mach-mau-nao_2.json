Common causes of cerebral vascular occlusion include: (1)\nAtherosclerosis: This is the most common cause of cerebral vascular occlusion. Nearly 65% ​​of strokes due to blood vessel blockage stem from atherosclerosis. This is due to atherosclerosis of large extracranial or intracranial blood vessels or occlusion of perforating (small) arterial branches located in the brain.; Thrombosis: About 20% - 30% of cases of cerebral vascular occlusion are due to heart valve disease, atrial fibrillation causing thrombosis.; In about 5% of cases, blood diseases or infections can cause cerebral thrombosis.\nThe danger elements\nSome factors can increase the risk of cerebral vascular obstruction, so do not be subjective:\nDiabetes: Statistics show that diabetics are 4 times more likely to suffer from cerebral thrombosis than normal people; Hypertension: This is one of the leading risk factors for clogged blood vessels. Too high intravascular pressure will cause atherosclerotic plaques to peel off in the vessel walls, causing atherosclerotic plaques to block the blood vessels.; Carotid artery disease: People with carotid artery disease or a family history of the disease are more susceptible to stroke due to cerebral embolism.; Atrial fibrillation: For people with atrial fibrillation, blood clots in the atria drift through the bloodstream, causing blood vessels to become clogged. About 15% of people with atrial fibrillation have a stroke due to cerebral vascular occlusion.; Hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolemia): Both high levels of bad cholesterol (LDL) and low levels of good cholesterol (HDL) can lead to arterial thrombosis.; Unhealthy lifestyle: People who rarely exercise, are obese, eat too much fat or foods high in salt, cholesterol or fat are susceptible to high blood pressure, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia - the causes leading to arterial thrombosis and cerebral vascular occlusion. In addition, smoking can also increase the risk of atherosclerosis, thrombosis, hypercholesterolemia, etc.; Age: Anyone can get a blood clot in the brain. However, the proportion of adults over 55 years old with cerebral vascular occlusion will be higher.; Medical history: People who have had a history of transient cerebral embolism have a high risk of recurrence in a short period of time.\nObese people have a higher risk of cerebral thrombosis",
