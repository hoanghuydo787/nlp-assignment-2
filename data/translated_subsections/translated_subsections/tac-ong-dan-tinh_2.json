Test results will help doctors distinguish between infertility due to undescended testicles and infertility due to blockage of the vas deferens.\nHigh FSH levels indicate abnormalities in spermatogenesis in the testicles, possibly no spermatogenesis or reduced spermatogenesis. However, in some cases the testicles do not produce sperm but FSH levels are still normal. In cases of azoospermia due to blockage of the vas deferens, the testicles still produce sperm normally and the hormone levels are also at normal levels.

This diagnostic method helps distinguish between infertility due to blockage of the vas deferens or sperm production disorders in the testicles.\nGenetic analysis\nThis diagnostic method is rarely performed when men are infertile due to blockage of the vas deferens. However, genetic analysis is still necessary because it helps doctors check for genetic factors that cause congenital bilateral vas deferens aplasia.",
