    "subsection_content": "Indications for treatment\nSurgery to repair the vas deferens to help patients have children without any assisted reproductive methods.; Removing sperm from the epididymis or testicles for in vitro fertilization or injecting sperm into the cytoplasm of the ovum.\nTreatments\n1. Obstruction in the testicles\nOnly the open TESE technique allows sperm retrieval from patients. This is the recommended technique in cases of intratesticular obstruction. The doctor will remove sperm from the testicles using testicular sperm extraction (TESE). The collected samples will be divided into small pieces or using certain types of enzymes to increase the possibility of collecting sperm from the seminiferous tubules. The rate of sperm retrieval is higher than with the TESA technique. (3)\nWith the TESA (Testicular sperm aspiration) technique, the doctor will remove sperm from the testicles by aspiration, use a needle to poke into the testicular tissue and slowly suck out a tissue sample, often having to aspirate many tissues in many different locations. Then separate the tissue and look for sperm under a microscope. If spermatogenesis is impaired, the ability to retrieve sperm is usually low, about 50%.\n2. Epididymal obstruction\nIn case of epididymal obstruction, the doctor will remove sperm from the epididymis using microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration (MESA). This surgery is indicated in cases of congenital absence of the vas deferens CBAVD (Congenital Bilateral Absence of the Vas Deferens).\nThe doctor will perform an epididymectomy and remove the sperm. The success rate of MESA is high. Sperm is usually collected in large quantities and can be frozen. However, this method also has some disadvantages such as being highly invasive, the collected fluid mixed with many red blood cells and a lot of fibrous adhesion, making it difficult for cases requiring subsequent surgery.\nIn addition, TESE and PESA techniques are also options in cases of epididymal obstruction. PESA (Percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration) is a treatment method to retrieve sperm by epididymal aspiration, without needing surgery to open the testicle or expose the epididymis. This is the method of first choice in cases of azoospermia due to obstruction.\n3. Proximal blockage of the vas deferens\nConnecting the vas deferens to the epididymis is performed in cases of congenital obstruction, infection, post-vasectomy sterilization or spontaneous epididymal obstruction... About 20-40% of couples get pregnant after intercourse. (4)\n4. Obstruction of the distal end of the vas deferens\nVasectomy reattachment technique is performed in cases of vasectomy for sterilization, vas deferens blockage in the groin area due to trauma, or previous inguinal hernia surgery. When applying this technique, most cases are successful. Sperm appears in 70–95% of patients and pregnancy occurs in about 30–75% without the need for any assisted reproductive methods.\nThe factor that affects surgical results is the number of years from sterilization to reconstruction. In particular, narrow section length and successful results are inversely proportional. However, in some cases it is not possible to repair the disruption of the vas deferens on both sides due to complications after inguinal hernia surgery, undescended testicles... In these cases, the TESE/MESA technique or sperm aspiration from The proximal vas deferens can be performed and cryopreserved for ICSI. ICSI (Intra-cytoplasmic Sperm Injection) is a method of injecting sperm directly into the ovum to create an embryo that requires only one egg and one sperm.\n5. Ejaculatory duct blockage\nTreatment of ejaculatory duct obstruction depends on the cause of the disease.\nTransurethral resection of the ejaculatory ducts TURED (Transurethral resection of the ejaculatory ducts): Applied in cases of ejaculatory duct obstruction due to post-inflammation and one or two ejaculatory ducts form cysts in the midline inside the prostate. Ultrasound with a rectal probe during surgery will make this technique safer. Postoperative complications of TURED are retrograde ejaculation, urine reflux into the ejaculatory duct, seminal vesicles, and vas deferens.; MESA, TESE: Sperm aspiration from the proximal end of the vas deferens, seminal vesicle aspiration under ultrasound guidance and direct cyst aspiration.\nWith the mission of bringing happiness and trust to couples, the Andrology Department of Tam Anh General Hospital was born, providing high-class services in consulting, examining, diagnosing and treating diseases.
