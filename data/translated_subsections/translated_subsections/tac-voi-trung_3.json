    "subsection_content": "Currently, to determine whether a patient has a problem with fallopian tube blockage or not, the doctor will perform one of the following two diagnoses: (4)\nHysterosalpingogram (HSG): This is an imaging test prescribed by the doctor to check the condition of the inside of the uterus and fallopian tubes. To perform this technique, a speculum is used to open the vagina, then a catheter is inserted to pump fluid (containing dye) through your cervix into the uterus. The dye in the fluid helps the doctor see more clearly inside the fallopian tubes on an X-ray. The flow of fluid from the ends of one or both fallopian tubes can determine whether one or both tubes are open. If the fallopian tubes are not blocked, the fluid will slowly flow out of the end of the tube and be absorbed by the body. If the fluid does not penetrate or flow completely through one or both fallopian tubes, it indicates that the fallopian tubes are affected, also known as fallopian tube obstruction.; Laparoscopy: In this minimally invasive outpatient procedure, a surgical instrument called a laparoscope is inserted through a very small incision below the navel. The surgeon can look through the endoscope to see if one or both tubes are clear. Laparoscopy can also be used to look for other problems that can affect fertility, such as scar tissue (adhesions) or endometriosis. However, doctors do not recommend early diagnosis using this exploration technique because it is invasive and difficult to treat.",
