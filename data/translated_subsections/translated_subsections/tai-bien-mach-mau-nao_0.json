The disease becomes a dangerous threat to human health and life.\nA stroke is a condition in which the brain's blood vessels (arteries, capillaries or veins) are suddenly blocked or ruptured without a traumatic brain injury.\nWhen capillaries burst and become clogged, brain cells will lack oxygen and nutrients and begin to die. The longer the time goes on, the more brain cells die, causing the patient to suffer serious damage, even causing death. If they are lucky enough to be saved, the patient is likely to experience serious complications such as paralysis of the limbs, hemiplegia, inability to communicate, etc.\nThere are many ways to classify strokes. Among them, the most common way is divided into 2 groups: Stroke due to cerebral ischemia and stroke due to cerebral hemorrhage. (2)\nIschemic\nAbout 80% of strokes are due to ischemia in the brain. As a result, blood flow to the brain is reduced or blocked, causing not enough blood to feed brain cells, causing brain cells to die. Within 4 hours from the time the patient has the first symptoms of stroke, if not treated promptly, it will lead to death.\nBrain hemorrhage\nThe second type of stroke is cerebral hemorrhage, with a rate of 20% of the total number of cases. Cerebral hemorrhage is a condition in which blood spills into brain tissue, causing brain swelling and increased pressure in tissues around the brain. At this time, brain cells will gradually die and cause brain circuit rupture.\nIn just a few minutes, a patient with a stroke due to brain hemorrhage can die, requiring quick and timely emergency treatment. Therefore, the death rate of patients from brain hemorrhage is often much higher than in other cases.\nThere are two types of stroke: stroke due to cerebral infarction and cerebral hemorrhage",
