    "subsection_content": "Stroke is divided into 3 main stages of progression, including:\nInitiation phase\nThis is the first stage of the disease, with no serious or characteristic symptoms yet, making it easy to confuse it with other diseases or ignore the signs of the disease.\nDecision phase\nAfter the initial stage, stroke will move to a more severe stage. If intervention is performed at this stage, the patient will still be able to survive, but there will be serious complications such as vegetative disorders, coma, hemiplegia, etc.\nProgressive stage\nThe progressive stage is the final stage of a person having a stroke, and is also the most dangerous stage. If this stage is skipped, the person having a stroke will have a very high risk of death. Emergency cases and interventions during this period are also more difficult and the success rate is lower.",
