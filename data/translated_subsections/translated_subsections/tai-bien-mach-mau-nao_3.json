    "subsection_content": "The cause of a stroke will often vary depending on the type of stroke the patient has. Specifically:\nAccident or ischemic stroke\nPeople with ischemic stroke often have blood clots blocking the flow of blood and oxygen to brain cells. The cause of this condition is due to fatty deposits forming in plaques, located in the arteries and blocking the flow of blood. This condition is called atherosclerosis. Therefore, it can be said that atherosclerosis is the main cause of ischemic stroke.\nIn addition, age is also a risk factor for stroke. Our arteries tend to become narrower as we age, making our risk of lack of blood flow to the brain higher.\nStroke due to cerebral hemorrhage\nThe main cause of stroke due to cerebral hemorrhage is high blood pressure, which causes blood vessels in the skull to burst and bleed into the surrounding brain.\nA stroke can be caused by blood vessel blockage or brain bleeding",
