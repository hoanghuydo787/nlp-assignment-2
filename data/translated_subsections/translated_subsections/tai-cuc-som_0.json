    "subsection_content": "The heart muscle operates thanks to electrical signals that generate rhythm and conduct impulses to help the heart muscle contract and pump blood to nourish the body's organs. The heart's electrical activity is simply divided into two phases: depolarization (heart contracts) and repolarization (heart rests after contraction). When the heart's electrical system is not working as it should, premature repolarization can occur. Early repolarization can be detected by suggestive images on the electrocardiogram (ECG), which are small notch-shaped waves that follow the end of a normal ventricular depolarization wave.",
