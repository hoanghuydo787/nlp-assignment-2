    "subsection_content": "Most patients with early repolarization do not have any noticeable symptoms. The disease is often discovered accidentally through electrocardiography during a general examination. Patients with early repolarization often have low baseline heart rates.\nSome patients with premature repolarization may experience severe arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation).\nAt this time, the patient appears to have symptoms of fainting, near fainting, and bouts of dizziness. These are the first warning signs and suggestive of serious illness. Therefore, it is important to see a doctor immediately when these symptoms appear.",
