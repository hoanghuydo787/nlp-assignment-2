If signs suggestive of abnormalities are seen on the electrocardiogram, the doctor will conduct a thorough medical history and symptoms related to arrhythmia. The doctor will also do a clinical examination and give some paraclinical indications such as echocardiography, Holter ECG, exercise ECG, cardiac MRI, genetic testing...
