    "subsection_content": "If a patient is assessed by an arrhythmia specialist to be at no risk or low risk, the patient usually does not need any specific treatment. If a patient is stratified as high risk, that patient needs specific treatment, which includes:\nImplantation of a defibrillator (ICD) under the skin. This method is often used, the machine is implanted in the chest near the heart to control abnormal electrical impulses.; Use medicine. Some medications work to reduce abnormal electrical activity in the heart that causes arrhythmias.; Arrhythmia ablation using radiofrequency waves. In some cases, the procedure is highly effective in eliminating or reducing electrically abnormal areas in the heart.; The choice of method depends on each patient's unique situation.\nA place to receive and treat patients with early repolarization as well as cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, myocardial ischemia...), Cardiovascular Center, Tam Anh General Hospital System Gathering a team of experts who are leading doctors in the industry, equipped with advanced machinery systems. Treatment regimens are individualized for each patient, highly effective in improving symptoms and preventing dangerous complications of the disease.\nThe rate of early repolarization in the general population ranges from 5% to 15%; The wide range reflects differences in definition as well as variation in patterns of early repolarization over time.",
