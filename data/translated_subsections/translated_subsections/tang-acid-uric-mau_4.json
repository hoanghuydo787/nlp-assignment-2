In addition, urine tests also contribute to supporting diagnosis and finding the cause of uric acid blockage in the blood. Blood and urine test results will show the following indicators:\nUric acid concentration; Uric acid concentration in urine; Look for MSU crystals in urine.\nReference: Necessary gout tests to diagnose the disease\nIt should be noted that aids in diagnosing gout may require the use of ultrasound, x-rays of painful swollen areas or joint puncture to look for MSU crystals.",
