    "subsection_content": "Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a condition of pressure in the pulmonary circulation. In pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary blood vessels constrict or become constricted, leading to right ventricular hypertrophy and failure, seriously affecting right heart function. -said Nguyen Thi Oanh, M.D., Department of Cardiology, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi. (first)\nIn the structure of the heart, the right ventricle is responsible for pumping blood to the lungs through a large blood vessel called the pulmonary artery. In the lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide (CO2) and enriches it with oxygen (O2). However, due to many different reasons, the cells lining the pulmonary artery can change and the artery wall becomes hardened and thickened; Blood vessels in the lungs are now narrowed, clogged and destroyed. The damage slows blood flow through the lungs, causing increased pulmonary artery pressure.\nHigh pressure in the pulmonary arteries forces the heart to work harder to pump blood through the lungs. However, this constant exertion causes the heart muscle to gradually weaken and may stop working, leading to heart failure.",
