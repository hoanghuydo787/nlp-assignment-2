In addition, pulmonary hypertension can appear in newborns, this is called persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). Newborns with this condition need to be treated in an intensive care unit.

This leads to delayed diagnosis and failure to identify pulmonary hypertension until symptoms become more severe and other signs arise.\nSome signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension include:\nTired; Chest pain or pressure; Dizziness or fainting; Fast or pounding heartbeat (palpitations); Shortness of breath, initially with exercise and eventually at rest; Swelling (edema) in the ankles, legs, and eventually the abdomen; Blue lips and skin (cyanosis)\nSymptoms often get worse with exercise and this limits the person's ability to participate in physical activities.",
