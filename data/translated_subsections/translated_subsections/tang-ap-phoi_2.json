Due to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)\nChanges in the smaller branches of the pulmonary artery (the artery wall becomes thick and stiff) narrow the space for blood flow to pass through and lead to increased pulmonary vascular pressure. Common causes include:\nIdiopathic PAH (cause unknown); PAH is related to genetic factors (mutations in the BMPR2 gene and other genes); PAH caused by drugs or toxins; Congenital heart disease (such as abnormal holes in the heart, etc.); Other conditions such as: Connective tissue diseases (such as scleroderma, lupus, etc.), portal hypertension (cirrhosis), HIV infection, thyroid disease, sickle cell disease, etc.; Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease; Pulmonary capillary hemangioma\nA small number of people develop pulmonary hypertension without any medical condition. This is called idiopathic PAH. In very rare cases, PAH can be inherited.\nDue to left heart disease\nIf there is an abnormality in the left side of the heart, it causes blood stasis or reduces the contractility of the left heart and increases the pressure of the pulmonary circulation. Problems on the left side of the heart are one of the most common causes of this disease, including heart valve problems (mitral valve, aortic valve), left ventricular dysfunction, heart disease. congenital myocardium or left ventricular blood flow obstruction.\nDue to lung disease or lack of oxygen\nDr. Oanh said, pulmonary hypertension is also sometimes related to lung diseases or hypoxia, including:\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): This is the name for a group of lung diseases that cause difficulty breathing, including: emphysema (damage to the air sacs in the lungs) and chronic bronchitis (long-term inflammation of the airways). long).; Interstitial lung disease: A group of lung disorders that cause scarring of lung tissue, including: alveolar septa, interalveolar tissue, and blood vessels. This disease makes it difficult for the body to get enough oxygen.; Conditions that affect breathing during deep sleep, such as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.; Living at high altitudes for long periods of time can put you at risk of disease.; Progressive lung diseases: low levels of oxygen in the blood cause the pulmonary arteries to narrow. This forces blood into a smaller space, increasing pulmonary artery pressure.\nDue to blood clots\nPulmonary hypertension occurs when a blood clot causes a narrowing or blockage of a pre-existing pulmonary artery. In addition, other blood clotting disorders can also be the cause of the disease.\nOther causes\nAlthough less common, these causes can also cause pulmonary hypertension, including:\nSarcoidosis: Condition that causes inflammation of various organs, including the lungs and lymph nodes; Agranulocytosis X: Rare condition that causes scarring (granulomas) and air-filled cysts, mainly in the lungs; Compression of blood vessels in the lungs caused by a tumor or other cause.\nThe danger elements\nThe disease occurs in all ages, including children, and the incidence increases with age; More commonly diagnosed in people between 30 and 60 years old and more common in women. The older you get, the higher your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension, especially if you are 75 years of age or older.\nOther factors that may be risk factors for this condition include: Being overweight, having congenital heart disease, family history of the condition, exposure to asbestos, blood clotting disorders or family history of blood clots in the lungs.\nAdditionally, the use of drugs, including diet pills and methamphetamine and cocaine; Use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (used to treat anxiety and depression) is also a risk factor for the development of pulmonary hypertension.",
