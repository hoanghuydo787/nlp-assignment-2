(4)\nPhysical examination\nThe patient will have a physical examination by a doctor to check for signs of pulmonary hypertension as well as other heart and lung problems. During the examination, your doctor will ask questions about your health and medical history, as well as any related symptoms.\nBesides, checking the size of the veins in the neck is also something that needs to be done. If the neck veins are dilated, this may be a sign of right-sided heart failure. Additionally, the doctor will check the size of the liver by palpating the upper right area of ​​the abdomen.\nThe doctor will perform a number of other examinations, such as: listening to the patient's heart and lungs with a stethoscope; Look at your abdomen, ankles, and legs for swelling; blood pressure; Measure blood oxygen levels with an oxygen saturation meter.\nPulmonary hypertension can be difficult to diagnose because many of its signs are similar to those of other conditions. Therefore, after a physical examination, the doctor can perform a few paraclinical tests to get more information and get the most accurate conclusion.\nPerform testing\nEchocardiogram: A method that uses high-frequency sound waves to create a moving image of the beating heart, shows blood flow through the heart, and can check pressure  in the pulmonary arteries. This test is done to help diagnose the disease and check how well the two ventricles are pumping blood.\nEchocardiography is a method to diagnose pulmonary hypertension.\nComputed tomography (CT): A series of X-rays taken to create cross-sectional images of bones, blood vessels, and soft tissues inside the body. Contrast may be injected into a vein to help assess blood vessels more clearly. A CT scan can show the size of the heart and any blockages in the pulmonary arteries. This test helps diagnose lung diseases that can lead to pulmonary hypertension such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pulmonary fibrosis.; Ventilation/perfusion scan (V/Q Scan): This technique helps find blood clots that can cause high blood pressure in the lungs.; Electrocardiogram (ECG): Helps monitor heart activity, can detect arrhythmia or signs of increased pressure in the right heart chamber.; Chest X-ray: Shows whether the pulmonary arteries or heart chambers are dilated or not and helps suggest other conditions of the lungs and heart; Right heart catheterization: is a mandatory investigation to confirm the diagnosis. The doctor places a catheter into a large vein, usually the femoral vein or the radial artery in the arm, and then threads it into the right side of the heart. A monitor records pressure in the right heart and in the pulmonary artery.; Blood tests: Helps determine some causes of the disease or detect signs of complications.; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Helps create detailed images of the heart, can show blood flow in the pulmonary artery and evaluate the functioning of the right ventricle.; Pulmonary ventilation function measurement: this non-invasive test measures the amount of air the lungs can hold and the flow of air in/out of the lungs. The technique is performed by blowing into an instrument called a spirometer.; Polysomnogram: Measures brain activity, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels and other factors during sleep. Probes help study sleep disorders to diagnose sleep apnea syndrome.; Lung biopsy: This is a rarely used type of surgery in which a small sample of tissue is removed from the lung. This test is done to check the cause.; Exercise testing: Your doctor may ask you to run on a treadmill or bike connected to a monitor to check for changes in oxygen levels, heart function, lung pressure, or other symptoms. other related issues or not.",
