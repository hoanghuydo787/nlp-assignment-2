    "subsection_content": "Potential complications of pulmonary hypertension include: (5)\nThickening/dilation of the right heart and heart failure (cor pulmonale): High pressure in the pulmonary artery forces the right ventricle to work harder to pump blood to the lungs to exchange oxygen. Over time, the right ventricle thickens (right ventricular hypertrophy), dilates the right heart chamber and leads to right heart failure, affecting the normal functioning of many organs and systems.; Blood clots: The disease increases the risk of blood clots forming in small arteries in the lungs.; Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia): If left untreated, this condition can cause irregular heartbeat and eventually death.; Bleeding in the lungs: Pulmonary hypertension can lead to bleeding into the lungs and coughing up blood, which is life-threatening.; Complications during pregnancy: The disease is very dangerous for pregnant women. It can cause complications for both mother and fetus, even miscarriage, stillbirth, and premature birth.\nBecause pulmonary hypertension can affect the entire body, it is essential that the patient is diagnosed and treated as soon as possible. The doctor will have a treatment regimen based on the cause of the disease.\nReference: How long can you live with pulmonary hypertension?",
