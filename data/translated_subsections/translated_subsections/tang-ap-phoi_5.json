Medications prescribed to treat the symptoms or complications of pulmonary hypertension include:\nVasodilators: These medications help relax and widen narrowed blood vessels, improving blood flow. Vasodilators can be taken orally, inhaled, injected or administered intravenously.; Guanylate cyclase (GSC) stimulator: This drug increases nitric oxide in the body, dilating the pulmonary arteries and reducing pressure in the lungs.; Blood vessel widening drugs: These drugs called endothelin receptor antagonists reverse the effects of a substance in the blood vessel wall that causes narrowing of blood vessels. However, these medications can harm the liver and should not be used during pregnancy.; Medications that increase blood flow: Called phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, medications can be used to increase blood flow through the lungs.; High-dose calcium channel blockers: Helps relax the muscles in blood vessel walls. Although calcium channel blockers can be effective, only a small number of people with Pulmonary Hypertension improve when taking them.; Blood thinners (anticoagulants): Your doctor may prescribe anticoagulants to help prevent blood clots. This medication increases the risk of bleeding, especially in people who are having surgery or receiving invasive procedures. If you take blood thinners, you will occasionally need blood tests to see if the medicine is working as it should.; Heart medications: Help the heart beat harder and pump more blood; can also help control irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia).; Diuretics: These drugs help the kidneys remove excess fluid from the body, to reduce fluid buildup in the lungs, legs and abdomen, easing the work load on the right heart.; Oxygen therapy: Breathing pure oxygen is sometimes recommended as a treatment for pulmonary hypertension, especially for people with sleep apnea.\nA variety of medications can help effectively treat this disease.

This method has been shown to reduce pressure in the pulmonary artery, improve breathing and increase mobility.; Atrial septal defect: A small hole is made in the interatrial septum (the wall between the left and right atria of the heart) using a cardiac catheter inserted through a blood vessel into the heart's chambers. This reduces pressure on the right side of the heart, so the heart can pump more effectively and blood flow to the lungs can be improved.
