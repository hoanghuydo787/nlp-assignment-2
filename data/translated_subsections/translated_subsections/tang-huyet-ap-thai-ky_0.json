    "subsection_content": "Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension is a phenomenon of increased blood pressure that appears after the 20th week of pregnancy and returns to normal levels 6 weeks after giving birth. Mild high blood pressure during pregnancy is about 140-159/90-109 mmHg, severe when it is ≥160/100 mmHg. (2)\nThe disease usually occurs in 5-10% of pregnant women\nSymptoms of high blood pressure during pregnancy include:\nChronic hypertension: Appears before pregnancy or at 20 weeks of pregnancy. This condition can last more than 42 days after birth, possibly related to proteinuria.; Gestational hypertension: Appears after the 20th week of pregnancy. This condition will return to normal within 42 days after birth, but can progress to chronic hypertension if blood pressure continues to increase thereafter.; Preeclampsia: This is a clinical form that appears when a pregnant woman has her first pregnancy, a multiple pregnancy, a molar pregnancy or a pregnant woman with phospholipid syndrome, especially when the pregnant woman has chronic hypertension, kidney disease or diabetes. Preeclampsia is diagnosed based on proteinuria test results and systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg. This condition often appears at 20 weeks in pregnant women with previously normal blood pressure, and is related to fetal growth retardation due to placental insufficiency. This is also the cause of premature birth.; Preeclampsia on the basis of chronic hypertension: This condition will have a high probability of occurring when a pregnant woman with high blood pressure has proteinuria for the first time.",
