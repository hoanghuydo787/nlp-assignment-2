This helps control blood pressure, detect early if the reading is abnormally high to have an appropriate treatment regimen, and prevent complications.\nTo monitor your blood pressure, the best way is to measure your blood pressure regularly. Your blood pressure readings may fluctuate, with highs and lows within 24 hours. They change at every moment when you exercise, rest, when you are in pain and even when you are stressed or angry. Occasionally, a high blood pressure reading does not mean you have hypertension. You will not be diagnosed with high blood pressure unless you have high blood pressure readings at least 2-3 times at different times.\nSee more: Instructions on how to properly measure blood pressure at home\nAccording to the recommendations of the National Heart Association, hypertension is diagnosed when blood pressure measured in the clinic is ≥140/90 mmHg. Prehypertension is determined when the index is in the range of 120-139/80-89 mmHg. Optimal blood pressure level is <120/80 mmHg.",
