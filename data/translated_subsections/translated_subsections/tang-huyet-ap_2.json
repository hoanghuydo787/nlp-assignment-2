    "subsection_content": "Most diseases commonly found in older people have no cause (idiopathic or primary hypertension); About 10% of conditions have a cause, also called secondary hypertension. (first)\nPrimary (idiopathic) hypertension\nIn about 90% of cases of high blood pressure, the cause is unknown.\nThe disease is familial, many family members suffer from this condition, especially when older or have diabetes. There are also other factors that easily lead to high blood pressure such as salty eating habits (a lot of salt), smoking, drinking a lot of alcohol, being overweight or obese, being physically inactive, and having a lot of stress. stress and pressure in life.\nSecondary hypertension\nWhen a direct cause is determined, it is called secondary hypertension. This condition accounts for about 10% of cases, but if treated according to the cause, the disease can be cured. Common causes are:\nKidney disease is the most common cause of secondary hypertension (eg: glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, chronic renal failure, renal artery stenosis...); Adrenal gland disease, an endocrine gland located just above the kidneys on each side, secretes hormones that regulate the body's salt, water and blood pressure. If a tumor of this gland secretes hormones abnormally, blood pressure will increase. Tumor removal treatment can cure high blood pressure, without needing long-term medication or less medication intake.; Some other endocrine diseases also cause blood pressure to increase such as hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, Cushing's disease,...; Some oral medications such as corticosteroids (treatment of arthritis, Lupus, asthma, allergies, etc.), anti-inflammatory drugs, pain relievers, hormone replacement or birth control pills, etc.; Sleep apnea syndrome.; Hypertension in children or young adults requires the exclusion of congenital heart disease due to coarctation of the aorta. At that time, the blood pressure in the arms is very high, while the blood pressure in the legs is low or unmeasured. Treatment of this disease is surgery or stent dilatation in the narrowed segment of the aorta.\nSee more information about Hypertension disease shared by Dr. Ho Thi Tuyet Mai.",
