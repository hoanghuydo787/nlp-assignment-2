    "subsection_content": "The only way to diagnose hypertension is to measure blood pressure (2). Currently, there are 3 ways to measure blood pressure to diagnose the disease:\nBlood measurement at the clinic: BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg; Measure blood pressure at home: BP ≥ 135/85 mmHg; 24-hour continuous blood pressure monitor (Holter blood pressure machine): BP ≥ 130/80 mmHg\nHOW TO PROPERLY MEASURE BLOOD PRESSURE? Sit and rest for 15 minutes before measuring. Do not smoke or drink coffee 2 hours before measurement. Measurement position: lying on the bed or sitting with your back in a chair, both feet touching the floor, not crossing your legs, arms straight, placed at heart level, remaining silent during measurement. The first time the blood pressure is measured on both arms, the arm with the higher blood pressure level is chosen to measure and monitor blood pressure the next time. Each time take 2 measurements, with the same hand, each measurement is 2 minutes apart. If the difference in systolic blood pressure between the two measurements is > 10 mmHg, measure a third time after another 2 minutes. Take the average of the two most recent blood pressure measurements. Use an automatic measuring machine, one with an arm band of the appropriate size. Patients can measure their blood pressure in the morning or afternoon, or when they have symptoms suggesting high blood pressure mentioned above.\nWhat tests do hypertensive patients need to do?\nFor patients with hypertension, the following 2 groups of tests are needed:\nTesting to find the cause of high blood pressure. For example: renal artery stenosis, adrenal adenoma, aortic coarctation,...; The test evaluates the effect of blood pressure on organs in the body such as the heart, blood vessels, brain, kidneys and eyes.\nTests to find the cause of high blood pressure\nGeneral abdominal ultrasound: look for kidney and adrenal diseases;; Renal artery ultrasound: look for renal artery stenosis;; Aortic ultrasound: look for aortic coarctation;; Renal function tests (blood creatinine, urinary albumin, urinalysis), adrenal hormones (blood aldosterone, plasma renin, blood metanephrine, urine), thyroid (TSH), pituitary (blood cortisol, ACTH ),…; Abdominal CT or MRI scan to look for adrenal tumors;; Polysomnography: look for sleep apnea;\nRoutine tests evaluate the impact of blood pressure on organs in the body\nElectrocardiography: detects thickening and dilation of the heart chambers, arrhythmias or myocardial ischemia;; Echocardiography: evaluates heart function, thickening and dilation of heart chambers, regurgitation of heart valves;; Blood tests: blood formula, fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, kidney function, electrolytes, blood uric acid, thyroid function (TSH), blood fat, liver enzymes;; Total urine analysis, urinary microalbumin/creatinine ratio: evaluate the impact of blood pressure on kidney function such as causing proteinuria at different levels. In addition, urine analysis also helps detect glomerular and tubular diseases, urinary tract infections or accompanying diabetes;; Measure pulse wave velocity to evaluate blood vessel stiffness;; Measure ankle/brachial blood pressure index (ABI): to find stenosis or occlusion of peripheral arteries in both legs;; Retinal scan: detects damage to blood vessels at the bottom of the eye due to long-term high blood pressure;",
