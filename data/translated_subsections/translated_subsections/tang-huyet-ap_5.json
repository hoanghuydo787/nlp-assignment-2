Common complications include:\nCardiac complications: myocardial infarction, heart failure, decompensated heart failure, atrial fibrillation,...; Complications in the brain: cerebral infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, memory loss, etc.; Kidney complications: kidney failure at various levels, the most severe progression to end-stage chronic kidney failure requiring kidney replacement therapy (kidney transplant or periodic dialysis); Changes in blood vessels at the back of the eye due to high blood pressure, can cause hemorrhage, retinal vascular edema, and more seriously cause blindness; Peripheral artery disease in both legs: due to atherosclerosis causing narrowing or occlusion of small blood vessels in the legs, causing pain in the legs when walking, more severe ulcers, necrosis requiring limb amputation, causing disability; Erectile dysfunction: common, especially if accompanied by diabetes and smoking.\nWarning !!! Not treating or treating but not controlling blood pressure will lead to complications of hypertension on the heart, brain, kidneys and several other organs.",
