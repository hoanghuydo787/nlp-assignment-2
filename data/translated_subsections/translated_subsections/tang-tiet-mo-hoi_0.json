    "subsection_content": "Hyperhidrosis is a condition of excessive sweating even in normal situations. Areas of the body that often sweat a lot are the armpits, hands and feet. Sometimes, the sweat secretes so much that the patient always has an uncomfortable wet feeling in the hands or armpits, and has difficulty communicating (afraid to shake hands with others). (first)\nNormally, sweat glands are only active if the environmental temperature is high, or when you have a fever, participate in intense physical activities or are in a state of anxiety or stress. Under normal weather and physical conditions, the nerves that signal sweating will not send a signal. But for people with hyperhidrosis, these nerves are highly active in all circumstances. As a result, patients sweat all the time, even when in cool environments or at rest. Some people even sweat while swimming.",
