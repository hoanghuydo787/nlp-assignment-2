This is a spontaneous condition with no physical cause. In this group, patients experience excessive sweating due to excessive stimulation from the nerves to the sweat glands. Accordingly, sweat often secretes a lot in the hands, armpits, face or feet. This condition usually arises in childhood and is sometimes hereditary.\nSecondary hyperhidrosis\nIn this case, the patient sweats too much due to medical reasons or medications. Unlike primary conditions, secondary hyperhidrosis tends to occur all over or one area of ​​the body instead of just the hands, armpits, face or feet. In particular, this syndrome is likely to cause patients to sweat a lot while sleeping.\nHealth conditions or diseases considered to trigger secondary hyperhidrosis include:\nPregnant; Diabetes; Hyperthyroidism; Menopause; Fat; Parkinson disease; Rheumatoid arthritis; Lymphoma; Gout; Infectious diseases; Heart attack or heart failure; Respiratory failure; Stress, excessive worry; Abuse of alcohol or stimulants; Some cancers\nMeanwhile, some medications are also causes of excessive sweating, such as:\nDrugs to treat Alzheimer's disease; Antidepressants; Antidiabetic drugs: insulin and sulfonylureas; Pilocarpine (glaucoma medication)",
