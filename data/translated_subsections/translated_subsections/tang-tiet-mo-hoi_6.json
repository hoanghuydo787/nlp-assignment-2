    "subsection_content": "There are many methods of treating this syndrome, but each method has different advantages and disadvantages. Depending on the patient's condition and choices, the doctor will advise on appropriate methods: (4)\n1. Aluminum salt\nFor mild cases of hyperhidrosis, you can use antiperspirants containing aluminum chloride, which helps absorb sweat effectively. You will apply this solution to the affected area (hands, armpits, legs, etc.) once a day before going to bed until it is effective, and then maintain it once a week. This is a substance that easily causes skin irritation and dermatitis, especially in some young female patients with pre-existing allergies.\n2. Iontophoresis – iontophoresis technology\nWhen aluminum salts do not have much effect, iontophoresis technology can be considered. This technology uses a device that provides low voltage current to the treated body area immersed in ionized water, the ionic molecules will neutralize the activity of sweat glands. This is a fairly safe therapy, but the duration of effect is short and needs to be done many times.\n3. Anticholinergic drugs\nAnticholinergics are effective in reducing generalized sweating. This drug works to block the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. However, when taking the medicine, patients may experience some systemic side effects such as dizziness and constipation.\n4. Botox injection\nBotox injections are often used in cases of increased underarm sweating. Similar to iontophoresis technology, botox injections are often used after aluminum salts are less effective. Botox injections block the nerves that stimulate sweat glands, and usually last several weeks to months before needing repeat injections. Necrosis and inflammation of sweat glands causing pain and infection can also occur when using this method.\n5. Sympathectomy\nIf the above minimally invasive measures are unsuccessful or cause side effects that prevent treatment from continuing, the doctor will perform endoscopic surgery to burn the patient's sympathetic ganglia. This type of surgery is minimally invasive, has quick surgery time, high aesthetics, thoroughly treats the disease with extremely low recurrence rate and highest satisfaction in patients who choose this method.\nSympathectomy is performed with two or three small incisions (0.5 - 1 cm) in the armpit area, endoscopic instruments are inserted to observe and remove the sympathetic ganglia that control excessive sweating. odor in the corresponding area of ​​the body. The advantage of laparoscopic surgery is high aesthetics, almost immediate effectiveness with low recurrence rate. Recently, with the outstanding development of technology, endoscopic sympathetic ganglion ablation surgery is gradually becoming the top choice for patients with primary hyperhidrosis.\nHands before and after endoscopic sympathectomy, completely improving symptoms of hyperhidrosis",
