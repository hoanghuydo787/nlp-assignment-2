Causes of primary constipation\nConstipation with normal peristalsis: Caused by a disorder of the defecation mechanism, originating from a problem with the anal sphincter and sphincter. This type of constipation is very difficult to detect during physical examination.; Constipation with normal peristalsis: Caused by a disorder of the defecation mechanism, originating from a problem with the anal sphincter and sphincter. This type of constipation is very difficult to detect during physical examination.\nConstipation with slow peristalsis: When intestinal motility is poor, it will cause constipation. This type of constipation is more common in women with symptoms such as bloating and less need to defecate.; Constipation with slow peristalsis: When intestinal motility is poor, it will cause constipation. This type of constipation is more common in women with symptoms such as bloating and less need to defecate.\nConstipation due to pelvic floor dysfunction: Pelvic floor dysfunction is caused by degeneration of muscles and ligaments, leading to the inability to keep the organs in the pelvic floor in their correct position. The anus and rectum are also among the organs affected and lead to constipation. Characteristics of constipation due to this cause are straining a lot, incomplete defecation, requiring assistance to expel all the stool.; Constipation due to pelvic floor dysfunction: Pelvic floor dysfunction is caused by degeneration of muscles and ligaments, leading to the inability to keep the organs in the pelvic floor in their correct position.

Causes of secondary constipation\nDue to diet and lifestyle: Diet low in fiber, excess fat of animal origin, eating a lot of sugar, coffee, tea, alcohol, not drinking enough water; lack of exercise; frequently delay defecation. In children, constipation can also be caused by drinking powdered milk (formula milks that are low in fiber and too high in protein and sugar).; Due to diet and lifestyle: Diet low in fiber, excess fat of animal origin, eating a lot of sugar, coffee, tea, alcohol, not drinking enough water; lack of exercise; frequently delay defecation.
