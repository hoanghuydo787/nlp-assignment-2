    "subsection_content": "Refractive errors are familiar to many people, this is a general term used to refer to eye disorders [2]. There are 4 common types of refractive errors including:\nMyopia: image focuses in front of the retina; Farsightedness: images focus behind the retina; Astigmatism: the image of an object is not a point but a straight line that can be in front, behind or half in front - half behind the retina; Presbyopia: an eye condition caused by the aging process of the body, commonly found in people over 40 years old.\nRefractive errors can occur at any age, and are common among students, office workers, and people who have a lot of contact with electronic devices. Information from the Ministry of Health in 2020 shows [3], refractive errors are increasingly common among teenagers, with an incidence rate of 15%-20% in rural students, 30%- 40% in the city. If we consider only the group of children aged 6 - 15 years old across the country, the rate of refractive errors in this age group is about 20%, equivalent to nearly 3 million children.\nCompare eyes with nearsightedness and farsightedness with normal eyes and treatment directions",
