Nearsighted eyes can only see close objects clearly but cannot see distant objects clearly. This refractive error is common in young people such as students, office workers, and people who have a lot of contact with electronic devices. Myopia is measured in diopters (D) [4].; Farsightedness is a condition in which the eye has the posterior focal point behind the retina. Far and near vision are unclear. Therefore, the eye must always adjust to pull the image of the object forward to overlap with the retina. Farsightedness is mostly congenital, some cases occur at a lower rate such as: flat cornea, people with corneal scar disease,...[5]; Astigmatism: if the normal human cornea is spherical, the recorded image will be focused at a point on the retina. Particularly for people with astigmatism, the cornea has a different curvature, the resulting image will converge at many points on the retina, causing the image to be blurry and unclear. Astigmatism is mostly congenital and can include both nearsightedness and farsightedness; Presbyopia is a condition in which the eyes can only see distant objects clearly and have difficulty seeing close objects. In essence, presbyopia is quite similar to farsightedness, just with different causes. Most people will pay more attention to nearsightedness and forget about presbyopia. Presbyopia arises due to the body's natural aging process, this refractive error cannot be prevented and cannot be prevented. Because the eye's regulatory function is achieved thanks to the elasticity of the lens. Over time, the lens inside the eye gradually hardens and has poor elasticity, leading to a decrease in the eye's ability to adjust, making it difficult to see up close.",
