    "subsection_content": "There are two main causes of refractive errors in the eyes: genetics and environment. Among them, genetic factors account for not much. People whose parents both have refractive errors have a high chance that their children will also have them.\nEnvironment is a factor that greatly influences the incidence of refractive errors. Currently, cases of refractive errors all have in common due to unreasonable living habits such as: sitting in the wrong position, reading books and newspapers in low light conditions, overusing electronic devices,...\nIn addition, some possible causes include: aging lens, damage due to eye trauma, direct exposure to strong light sources (sunlight, welding sparks,...), Improper eye hygiene, age,...\nStudents sitting in the wrong posture and using electronic devices make their eyes susceptible to refractive errors",
