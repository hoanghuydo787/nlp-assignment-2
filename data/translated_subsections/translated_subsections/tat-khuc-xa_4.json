    "subsection_content": "1. Check your eyes\nAt facilities that examine and treat eye diseases, the eye refraction measurement process will be performed through vision boards and automatic refractors.\nFirst, the doctor will let the patient look at the vision board at an appropriate distance (usually 5m) and ask about the letters and numbers on the board to test vision ability.\nIf vision is less than 20/80, the patient will be tested with pinhole glasses. With each type of eyeglasses, the patient will tell the doctor whether his or her vision is clear or blurry, and whether or not he or she feels eye pain or dizziness.\nThe doctor will base on that to advise on the type of glasses with appropriate refraction.\n2. Check refraction\nThe doctor will check your eyes with an automatic eye refractometer to determine whether your eyes have a refractive error or not. At the end of this process, the patient will receive a vision test results form, the doctor will base on the above indicators to explain and analyze the eye condition.\nIndicators recorded on the ballot include [6]:\nR or OD (Oculus Dexter): Right eye symbol.; L or OS (Oculus Sinister): Left eye symbol.; SPH (Sphere): Sphericity of the eye. Sphericity with a minus sign (-) means the eye is nearsighted. Sphericity with a plus sign (+) means the eye is farsighted; CYL (Cylinder): The cylindrical degree of the eye, indicating the degree of eye disorder. The degree of cylindricalness with a minus sign (-) represents the degree of near disorder. The cylindrical degree with the sign (+) represents the degree of perturbation.; AX (Axis): Axis of confusion, only appears when the eyes are disordered; ADD: The increase between distance and near vision, only appears when the eye is presbyopic.; Diopters: Unit of measurement, used to determine the optical output of glasses.; PD: Sum of 2 distances from the middle of the bridge of the nose to the pupil of each eye, calculated in mm.\nAn example of how to read a refraction measurement result, if the refraction measurement result on the card reads: OD: -2.00D, OS: +2D, it means your right eye has 2 degrees of nearsightedness, 2 degrees of farsightedness in your left eye.\n3. Other tests\nBesides the above two methods, doctors can evaluate eye refraction through pupilloscopy in patients who are unable to respond (young children, people with cognitive or physical disabilities).\nAccordingly, doctors will use a microscope to shine light into the patient's eyes.\nFrom different lenses while observing light reflections or reflections in the patient's eyes to determine the accuracy of the eye's refractive error.",
