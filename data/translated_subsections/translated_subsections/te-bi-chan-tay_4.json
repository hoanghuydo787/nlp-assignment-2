Spinal degeneration\nOften occurring at night or when the weather changes, spinal degeneration causes joint cartilage and vertebrae to erode and rub against nerve roots, causing pain and numbness in the neck spreading to the arms or pain from the waist down. two legs.\n2. Disc herniation\nDisc herniation is a common cause of numbness in the arms and legs, often occurring in the cervical and lumbar discs. This condition occurs when the nucleus pulposus spills out of the fibrous disc and compresses the spinal nerves, thereby leading to numbness in the arms and legs, causing limited body movement.\n4. Osteoarthritis\nWhen the arm, knee or hip joints are worn out or damaged by negative factors, it will be difficult to move the arms and legs and lead to numbness in the arms and feet.\n5. Rheumatoid arthritis\nInflammation and damage to the hand and foot joints will also cause numbness in the hands and feet and often occurs after lying or sitting for too long in one position and is accompanied by muscle stiffness.\n6. Spinal stenosis\nThis is a congenital disease in which the spine is deformed and shrunk, causing the nerve roots passing through to be compressed, causing continuous and prolonged numbness in the limbs. If this condition is left for a long time, it will cause blockage of blood circulation and difficulty in movement.\n7. Multiple sclerosis\nProblems related to vision, numbness, itching, muscle weakness... are manifestations of multiple sclerosis. This disease has a direct impact on the central nervous system, causing damage to the Myelin membrane and leading to symptoms of numbness in the limbs.\n8. Polyradiculoneuritis\nThis condition occurs when the peripheral nervous system is damaged, causing sensory disturbances, leading to numbness in the limbs. If not detected and treated promptly, the patient may die from respiratory failure and lung aspiration.\n9. Atherosclerosis\nThis is the leading cause of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cerebrovascular accident. Signs of numbness in the hands and feet are due to abnormal material masses sticking to the vessel walls, causing hardening, narrowing of the vessel lumen, and nerve compression.\n10.
