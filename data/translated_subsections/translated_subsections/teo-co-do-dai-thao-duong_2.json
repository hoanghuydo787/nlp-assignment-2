Neurologists and Endocrinology - Diabetes specialists will do additional necessary tests.\nPatients must do some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies in the body. In addition, patients also need to perform other tests such as:\nA lumbar puncture (the fluid surrounding the spinal cord) to look for signs of inflammation; Electromyography to evaluate nerve conduction to check nerve activity in the legs.; MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the lower back to rule out the possibility of compression of the nerves around the spine.",
