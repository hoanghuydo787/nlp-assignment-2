    "subsection_content": "According to Dr. Trieu Vy, there are many causes. Testicular atrophy greatly affects physiology, reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, even impotence and male infertility. Common causes include: (2)\n1. Age\nJust like women have to go through menopause, men also experience a decrease in sex hormones causing hypogonadism, also known as andropause. A man's testosterone concentration will be highest at age 25, and after age 30, the male hormone concentration will gradually decrease by 0.8-1.4% each year. Low testosterone can cause the testicles to atrophy.\n2. Hormone imbalance\nHormone imbalance can cause testicular atrophy. If the body produces less testosterone, the testicles may shrink. Some potential causes of hormonal imbalance, factors that cause decreased testosterone production include:\nTestosterone replacement therapy can cause testicular atrophy. This therapy can stop the production of the hormone gonadotropin. If gonadotropin is not released, the pituitary gland will stop producing luteinizing hormone, causing the testicles to stop producing testosterone.; Taking anabolic steroids or taking estrogen can cause testicular atrophy similar to testosterone replacement therapy.\n3. Orchitis\nOrchitis causes pain and swelling in the testicles. There are many causes of testicular atrophy, but most are due to complications of orchitis after mumps. Mumps virus has a high affinity for testicular parenchyma, causing parenchymal edema, congestion of seminiferous tubules leading to necrosis accompanied by hyalinization of seminiferous tubules and testicular atrophy. The quantity and quality of sperm can be affected depending on the level of damage, the most severe can lead to no sperm in the semen.\nOrchitis caused by mumps is one of the possible causes of infertility, so it is necessary to raise public awareness about measures to prevent mumps, as well as how to handle cases of orchitis caused by mumps. bag. Normally about 10% of people with mumps will have orchitis and 10% of people with orchitis will have testicular atrophy. At this time, the testicles are swollen, the germ cells are damaged and cannot restore themselves, leading to fibrosis and atrophy. In case of atrophy of one testicle, the remaining testicle may grow larger to compensate for the atrophy of the testicle.\nIn addition, orchitis can also be caused by infection with germs, tuberculosis, chlamydia, HIV/AIDS, urinary tract infections or the process of placing catheters or other medical instruments into the penis.\n4. Testicular torsion\nTesticular torsion is often manifested by severe and sudden pain in the testicles. This occurs when the testicles rotate around their axis, causing sudden blockage of the spermatic cord, reducing or blocking blood flow to the testicles. If testicular torsion is not detected and treated promptly, it will cause permanent damage to the testicles, causing atrophy and even requiring amputation.\n5. Using alcohol\nAlcohol abuse and heavy and continuous use of alcohol over a period of time will cause indirect testicular atrophy. When alcohol is absorbed into the body, alcohol will undergo metabolism and produce by-products that cause damage to testicular tissue, testicular membranes and germ cells in the testicles... Besides, oxidation of enzymes also block the metabolic process, making damaged cells unable to recover.\nOxidants in alcohol metabolism also inhibit testosterone production. Alcoholic men have lower testosterone levels, produce more natural opioids and reduce hypothalamic and pituitary hormones, affecting the male hormone production. When men's testosterone levels are low, it can cause testicular atrophy on one or both sides.\n6. Varicocele\nVaricocele is a dilation and torsion of the spermatic plexus. If not detected and treated, varicoceles reduce male fertility, causing pain and testicular atrophy.\n7. Undescended testicles\nUndescended testicles or undescended testicles are a common malformation in children. According to studies, the rate of undescended testicles in full-term children is about 3-5%, in preterm children it is 17-36%. 3 months after birth, due to the increase in male sex hormones, up to 70-75% of the testicles descend into the scrotum, so after 6 months the rate of undescended testicles is about 0.8-1.8%. .\nUntreated undescended testicles will have a reduced number of spermatocytes, delayed maturation or defects in spermatocytes, reduced number of Leydig cells, limited spermatogenic tubules, and immature Sertoli cells. formation, microscopic calcification, evident after 2 years of age, the ultimate consequence is infertility.\nA study by author Nguyen Huu Thanh (2013) with 144 patients over 18 years old, the results showed: 100% of patients with bilateral undescended testicles had no sperm; Only 49.1% of patients with unilateral undescended testicles: have normal sperm density. Newly treated undescended testicles after puberty have fibroatrophic degeneration, reducing the ability to produce sperm regardless of whether the testicles are high or low.\n8. Testicular cancer\nTesticular cancer is quite rare in men but is the most malignant disease affecting men aged 15-35 years old. Testicular cancer occurs when some cells in the testicles grow abnormally out of control, cancer cells divide to form testicular tumors. In some cases, testicular cancer can cause testicular atrophy. Testicular cancer is a disease with a good prognosis if detected early, and the 5-year survival rate in patients is greater than 95%.",
