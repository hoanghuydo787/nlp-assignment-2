    "subsection_content": "Currently, the treatment of testicular atrophy depends on the cause of testicular atrophy. If the cause is a sexual tract infection or other infection, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection.\nAccording to doctors, patients with signs of endocrine damage and decreased sexual desire due to testicular atrophy need to be examined and have their endocrine levels adjusted. After the examination, the doctor will give instructions on exercise regimen and use of drugs to regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, not simply supplementing testosterone.\nFor patients whose testicles are atrophied due to undescended testicles, not located in the scrotum but located in the abdomen, orchiectomy may be indicated. Patients with varicocele that weakens sperm life can have both sperm retrieval surgery and varicocele treatment combined.\nWith the development of micro-TESE microsurgical technique to extract testicular tissue to find sperm, many men with testicular atrophy and azoospermia still have the opportunity to become fathers. ”At IVFTA-HCM, we receive many cases of men with testicular atrophy. Recently, there was a case of a man with testicular atrophy due to complications of mumps, whose testicles shrank to only ¼ of their normal size. Doctors at IVFTA-HCM performed micro-TESE surgery to find sperm for testicles as small as peanuts and succeeded in finding 5 remaining sperm in the hair-sized seminiferous tubules. And happiness smiled when the couple had good news thanks to the number of embryos created from the husband's \"little sperm.\"\nMen still have the opportunity to have children thanks to modern treatment techniques.",
