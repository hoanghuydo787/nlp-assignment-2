    "subsection_content": "Causes of stillbirth can vary based on gestational age and underlying risk factors. In some cases, doctors cannot determine the cause of stillbirth. A 2011 study found that in about 1/4 of stillbirths, no cause could be found.\nCommon causes of stillbirth are:\n1. Chromosomal abnormalities and congenital defects\nChromosomal abnormalities (such as chromosomal disorders, chromosomal mutations...) and birth defects in the fetus (placental edema, hydrocephalus, anencephaly...) are the leading causes of stillbirth condition. Statistics show that about 14% of stillbirths comes from this cause.\n2. Intrauterine growth restriction\nIntrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a condition in which the fetus is significantly smaller for gestational age. In severe cases, this condition can cause stillbirth or increase the risk of the baby dying at birth (because the baby is not provided with adequate oxygen or nutrition).\n3. Placental abruption and other obstetric complications\nPlacental abruption is a condition in which the placenta suddenly separates from the uterine wall while the fetus is still in the mother's womb. This is a dangerous obstetric complication that can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth or premature birth. The cause of this phenomenon is due to premature rupture of the mother's membranes, direct trauma to the abdomen or structural abnormalities in the uterus. Pregnant mothers who have an unhealthy lifestyle, such as smoking or using stimulants, also contribute to increasing the risk of placental abruption.\nAlong with placental abruption, other obstetric complications such as multiple pregnancies, amniotic fluid loss, excess amniotic fluid... are also believed to be risk factors leading to stillbirth.\n4. Infection\nIf a pregnant woman has certain bacterial and viral infections, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs), the risk of stillbirth increases. About 13% of stillbirths are due to infections in pregnant women.\n5. Problems with the umbilical cord\nIt's very rare for umbilical cord accidents to occur during pregnancy, such as the cord becoming too tight or the cord being wrapped too tightly around the baby's neck. However, this is an extremely dangerous phenomenon, causing the fetus to be cut off from its supply of oxygen and nutrients, leading to stillbirth. About 10% of stillbirths are related to umbilical cord abnormalities.\n6. Pregnant beyond the due date\nStudies show that women who are pregnant beyond 42 weeks have a higher risk of stillbirth. The cause may be that the placenta has lost its ability to support the fetus.\n7. Mother has some diseases\nSome medical conditions in pregnant women (before pregnancy or discovered during pregnancy) are also associated with an increased risk of stillbirth. These diseases include:\nLupus erythematosus; Blood clotting disorders; Diabetes during pregnancy; Pregnancy hypertension; Heart or thyroid disease; Overweight – obesity\nWomen with gestational hypertension need to be alert to the risk of stillbirth\n8. Tobacco and stimulants\nStudies have shown that pregnant women who smoke, drink alcohol or use some stimulant drugs during pregnancy have a higher risk of stillbirth than other pregnant women.",
