    "subsection_content": "No mother wants to terminate her pregnancy when her baby is not yet full term. Therefore, to prevent stillbirth, mothers need to follow some principles before and during pregnancy.\nBefore getting pregnant\n1. Quit smoking\nThe chemicals in cigarettes are agents that prevent oxygen and nutrients from being passed from the mother to the fetus. Not only that, thousands of toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke also pass through the placenta to your baby. Therefore, stopping smoking is the first thing you must do when deciding to have a baby.\n2. Maintain a reasonable weight\nOverweight - obese women (BMI ≥ 23) may experience complications during pregnancy such as gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia during pregnancy... - contributing factors increased risk of stillbirth. Therefore, make sure you keep your weight within normal limits (ideal BMI is between 18.5 - 22.9) by eating moderately and exercising regularly before getting pregnant.\nEat scientifically and exercise regularly to achieve your ideal weight before pregnancy\n3. Stay away from alcohol and drugs\nAlong with tobacco, alcohol and drugs can seriously affect fetal development, increasing the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth. Therefore, abstain from alcohol and stimulants before and during pregnancy to ensure your baby is born healthy and safe.\nDuring pregnancy\n4. Monitor fetal movements\nA baby kicking vigorously is a sign that he or she is developing healthily. If you feel the fetus suddenly moves less than usual, go to the hospital for a checkup immediately. By intervening early, you can find the cause of your baby's slow development, thereby promptly preventing stillbirth.\n5. Sleep on your side during the third trimester\nResearch has shown that sleeping on your side during the third trimester is safer for your baby. If you lie on your back, the total weight of your abdomen will put pressure on other organs in your body. Specifically:\nWhen you sleep on your back, the baby and the weight of your belly put pressure on the main blood vessels that supply the uterus. This can restrict blood/oxygen flow to the baby.; In late pregnancy, women who lie on their back more than on their sides will have less activity and their heart rate will slow down. The reason is that the amount of oxygen in the baby's body is lower when the mother lies on her back.\nPregnant women sleeping on their side during the third trimester will be safer for the baby\n6. Take care of yourself\nWhether a pregnancy goes smoothly and whether the baby is born healthy or not depends greatly on the mother's health condition. That means you need to know how to take care of yourself and listen to your body to promptly handle abnormalities that happen to you and your fetus. You should:\nPregnancy check-up on schedule and complete tests as required. This helps doctors closely monitor the development and growth of the fetus. During prenatal visits, the doctor will also diagnose early risks that may occur during pregnancy, such as preeclampsia, diabetes, hypertension...; Tell your doctor about unusual signs that suddenly occur during pregnancy such as bleeding, stomach pain, fever or other symptoms that worry you.; Get a flu shot because women who get the flu while pregnant will increase the risk of stillbirth as well as dangerous health complications.; Supplement folic acid before pregnancy and throughout pregnancy as prescribed by your doctor to reduce the risk of fetal defects.",
