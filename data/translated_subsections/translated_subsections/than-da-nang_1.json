Accordingly, the cause of the disease can come from:\nChemical or medicinal substances, including antioxidants (such as diphenyl-thiazole and nordihydro guaiaretic acid), alloxan and steptozotoxin, lithium chloride and cis-platinium.; Abnormal genes cause polycystic kidney disease, meaning that in most cases, the disease has a genetic component. Sometimes, a genetic mutation occurs spontaneously, so that neither parent has a copy of the mutated gene. (first)\nPolycystic kidney disease caused by various genetic defects is divided into two types:\nAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Signs and symptoms of ADPKD usually develop between the ages of 30 and 40. The disease usually occurs in adults, but children can also develop the disorder. If a parent has the disease, the disease will be passed on to their children. If a parent has ADPKD, each child has a 50% risk of developing the disease. This form accounts for most cases of polycystic kidney disease.; Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD): Less common than ADPKD, signs and symptoms usually appear soon after birth. Sometimes, symptoms reappear during childhood or adolescence. Only if both parents have an abnormal gene can inherit this disorder, then each child has a 25% chance of having the disease.\nThere are three main mechanisms of kidney cyst formation:\nObstruction in the renal tubule lumen; Renal tubular epithelial cell proliferation; Changes in the basement membrane of the kidney tubule",
