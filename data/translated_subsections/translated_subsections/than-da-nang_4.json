    "subsection_content": "Complications related to polycystic kidney disease include:\nHigh blood pressure: Considered a common complication of polycystic kidney disease. If left untreated, high blood pressure can cause further damage to the kidneys and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. Hypertension can occur early, occurring at a rate of 13-20% of patients even when there is no kidney failure. (2); Loss of kidney function; It is one of the most serious complications of polycystic kidney disease. Nearly half of people with the disease have kidney failure by age 60. Polycystic kidneys can interfere with the kidney function that keeps waste from building up to harmful levels (uremia). As the disease gets worse, it can lead to end-stage kidney disease. Then continuous kidney dialysis or transplantation is needed to prolong life.; Chronic pain: Pain is a common symptom for people with polycystic kidney disease. Pain often occurs in the hips or back. The pain may also be related to urinary tract infection, kidney stones, or malignancy.; Development of cysts in the liver: The likelihood of developing liver cysts for people with polycystic kidney disease increases with age. While both men and women develop cysts, women more often develop larger cysts. Female hormones and multiple pregnancies may contribute to the development of liver cysts.; Developing an aneurysm in the brain: A balloon-like bulge in a blood vessel in the brain can cause bleeding (hemorrhage) if it ruptures. People with polycystic kidney disease have a high risk of developing aneurysms and conversely, people with a family history of aneurysms have a high risk of developing polycystic kidneys.; Pregnancy complications: Pregnancy is successful for most women with polycystic kidney disease. However, in a few cases, people who were at risk of high blood pressure or impaired kidney function before becoming pregnant may develop a life-threatening disorder called preeclampsia.; Heart valve abnormalities: 1 in 4 adults with polycystic kidney disease has mitral valve prolapse. When this happens, the heart valves no longer close properly, which allows blood to leak back.; Colon problems: Weakness and pockets or pouches in the wall of the colon (diverticulosis) may develop in people with polycystic kidney disease.; Bleeding in the cyst causes gross hematuria: occurs in 15-20% of patients. Gross hematuria often occurs after trauma. Perirenal bleeding rarely occurs; if it occurs, it is usually due to trauma that ruptures the cyst.; Bacterial infection: This is the main reason why people are hospitalized. Bacteria reach the kidneys through the upstream route. If the cyst is infected, the cyst will increase in size and cause pain. On examination, the kidneys are enlarged and painful when pressed; Kidney stones: About 11-34% of patients with polycystic kidneys have kidney stones. Cases of small kidney stones are often difficult to diagnose and easily overlooked.; Kidney cancer: Nearly 50% of kidney cancers occur in patients with this disease (eg, renal cell cancer, a small number of renal papillary cancers). Symptoms are considered when making a diagnosis, including hematuria, low back pain, kidney enlargement, intracystic bleeding.; Kidney failure: This is the most common complication in patients with polycystic kidney disease.; Reduced ability to concentrate urine: Degree depends on cyst volume and number of cysts. Blood sodium levels are often slightly reduced; Anemia: common in patients with severe kidney failure; Hyperuricemia: due to disorders of uric acid reabsorption and excretion of kidney tubules.",
