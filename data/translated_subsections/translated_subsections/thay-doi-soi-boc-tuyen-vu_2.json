    "subsection_content": "The exact cause of fibrocystic breast changes is unknown, but experts suspect that reproductive hormones, especially estrogen, play a role.\nDuring the menstrual cycle, hormone levels change causing discomfort in the breasts and areas of breast tissue that become thickened, tender, painful, and swollen. Fibrocystic breast changes tend to be more uncomfortable before menstruation, decreasing once menstruation begins.\nWhen examined under a microscope, fibrous change breast tissue consists of distinct components such as:\nRound or oval fluid-filled sacs (cysts).; A fibrous mass of fibrous tissue appears (fibrosis).; Overgrowth of cells (hyperplasia) lining the milk ducts or milk-producing tissue of the mammary glands (lobules).; Enlarged lobules in the breast (adenosis).\nFibrocystic breast changes most often occur between the ages of 30 and 50 years old. These changes rarely occur after menopause unless you are taking hormone replacement medications such as estrogen or progesterone.\nIf there are signs of breast pain, unusual nodules or tumors in the breast, you should see a doctor for early treatment.",
