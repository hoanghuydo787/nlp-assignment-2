This is a common disease and tends to increase in developing countries with a huge disease burden and treatment costs.\nMyocardial ischemia (also known as coronary artery disease, coronary heart disease, coronary insufficiency) is a condition caused by narrowed coronary arteries that limit the supply of blood, oxygen and nutrients to the heart, causing damage to part of the heart muscle. (first)\nThe typical clinical manifestation is stable angina attacks\nThe typical clinical manifestation of the disease is stable angina. Stable angina is the stabilization of coronary atherosclerotic plaques. During the development of atherosclerotic plaques, in some cases, due to atherosclerotic plaque cracking, it can quickly narrow or block the vessel lumen. This condition is called Acute Coronary Syndrome, which includes unstable angina, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.\nOn the contrary, in the case of a patient with acute coronary syndrome who is treated stably after 1 year, it will be considered stable coronary artery disease.",
