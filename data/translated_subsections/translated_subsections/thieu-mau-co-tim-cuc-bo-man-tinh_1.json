    "subsection_content": "Risk factors for chronic ischemic heart disease include a group of modifiable factors and a group of non-changeable factors:\nGroup of risk factors that cannot be changed\nAge: Epidemiological studies show that age is one of the factors that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. The older you get, the less effective your heart becomes because the heart wall thickens and the arteries harden, making it difficult to pump blood to the heart.; Gender: Men have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease and stroke than women. However, when entering menopause, women's risk of cardiovascular disease is no different than men's; and after age 65, the risk of disease in both sexes is the same.; Genetics: If a family member has a history of cardiovascular disease (father, mother, or older sibling had cardiovascular problems before age 55), the risk of this disease increases.\nGroup of modifiable risk factors\nSmoking habits: Smoking has been proven to be a factor that increases the risk of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease and stroke. In addition, smoking habits also cause lung cancer and many other dangerous diseases. People around passive smoking are at high risk of contracting the above diseases. Therefore, cardiovascular experts recommend that people should not smoke and quit smoking to avoid the risk of disease for themselves and their families.; Unhealthy lifestyle such as little exercise, frequent stress, use of stimulants containing cocaine...; Diabetes, hypertension but not treated or treated but not following doctor's instructions, leading to poor control.; A diet rich in fat and cholesterol causes plaque buildup, blocking blood circulation to the heart and other organs.\nSmoking habits increase the risk of many cardiovascular diseases",
