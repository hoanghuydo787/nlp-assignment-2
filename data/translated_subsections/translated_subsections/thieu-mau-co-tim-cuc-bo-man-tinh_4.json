Among them, medical treatment is still the main method applied to most cases of chronic myocardial ischemia or stable angina.\nInternally medical treatment\nSome medications prescribed for use in the treatment of stable angina include:\nAntiplatelet drugs such as Aspirin, Clopidogrel, Ticagrelor or Prasugrel.; Medicines to treat lipid disorders such as statins and ezetimibe; ACE inhibitors such as enalapril, perindopril, lisinopril,...; Beta-blockers such as Metoprolol, Bisoprolol, Carvedilol, Nebivolol, etc.; Calcium channel blockers such as dihydropyridines, non-dihydropyridines; Nitrate derivatives such as Nitroglycerin, Isosorbide dinitrate...\nNote: Patients should not arbitrarily use medication without a doctor's prescription.\nInterventional treatment\nIn cases where aggressive medical treatment has been performed but the patient still has symptoms of chest pain, the doctor may prescribe interventional treatment to increase myocardial perfusion.\nAngioplasty and stent placement: The doctor inserts a catheter through the peripheral artery to reach the blocked coronary artery, then inflates a small balloon attached to the tip of the catheter to normalize blood circulation. At the same time, a small mesh tube (stent) is placed at the site of the blockage to prevent the artery from narrowing again.; Coronary artery bypass surgery: The doctor grafts another blood vessel across the blocked coronary artery to circulate blood through stent placement: The doctor inserts a catheter through the peripheral artery to reach the vessel location. coronary artery is blocked, then part of the coronary artery is blocked.",
