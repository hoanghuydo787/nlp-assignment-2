Reduced blood flow is often the result of partial or complete blockage of the heart's coronary arteries. Heart anemia occurs most often when the patient is physically active or excited (at this time the heart requires greater blood flow). (first)\nOver time, the heart muscle is not supplied with enough blood and can become serious.
