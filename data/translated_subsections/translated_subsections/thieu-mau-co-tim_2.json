    "subsection_content": "Myocardial ischemia occurs when blood flow through one or more coronary arteries is impaired or obstructed. The main function of red blood cells (found in the blood) is to transport oxygen to other parts of the body, including the heart. When blood flow to the heart is reduced, it also means the amount of oxygen supplied to the heart is reduced.\nMyocardial ischemia can develop slowly over time due to clogged arteries, or it can also occur suddenly when blood clots appear to block the coronary arteries.\nSome causes of the disease include:\nDue to atherosclerosis: This is the most common cause of this disease. Atherosclerotic plaques are made up of cholesterol and accumulate on the walls of the arteries, hindering blood circulation.; Due to blood clots: Atherosclerotic plaques that accumulate on the walls of arteries can break down and form blood clots. These blood clots moving in blood vessels when encountering narrow segments can cause blockage, leading to sudden ischemia in the heart muscle and triggering myocardial infarction in patients.; Due to coronary artery spasm: When the muscles of the coronary arteries temporarily spasm, it will reduce blood flow and prevent the flow of blood supplying oxygen to the heart muscle. This is not a common cause of myocardial anemia.\nFactors that trigger angina pectoris\nSome of the following factors can trigger angina in patients with myocardial ischemia:\nStrenuous exercise; Tension, stress; Using potentially addictive substances such as cocaine; The temperature is too cold\nRisk factors for ischemic heart disease\nSome of the factors below can increase the risk of disease:\nTobacco: Many studies suggest that regular smoking increases the risk of blood clots. Smoking is also one of the causes of hardening of the artery walls, leading to anemia in the heart muscle; Hypertension: Hypertension, if left untreated over time, can lead to atherosclerosis and damage to the coronary arteries.; Diabetes: When the endothelium of blood vessels in diabetic patients is damaged, it causes vasoconstriction and adhesion of platelet cells, forming many thrombi in the vessel, causing acute vascular occlusion. ; Obesity: Being overweight or obese can easily lead to diabetes, high blood pressure and increase cholesterol levels in the blood.; Lazy lifestyle: Lazy exercise also increases the risk of obesity and easily leads to anemic heart muscle.; Smoking is one of the risk factors for myocardial ischemia",
