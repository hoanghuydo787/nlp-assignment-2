    "subsection_content": "The disease can cause myocardial infarction, a complication that has a very high death rate if the patient does not receive timely emergency treatment. The longer the sudden blockage of the coronary artery caused by a thrombosis lasts, the more the patient's life is threatened.\nBesides, myocardial ischemia can cause other complications such as:\nHeart failure; Heart arrhythmia; Chronic angina; Limit physical activity\nThus, patients need to pay special attention in treatment, control and prevention. If you see symptoms of this disease, contact a medical facility for timely care. See some dangerous complications of myocardial ischemia.",
