    "subsection_content": "Through symptoms, it is not possible to judge whether a patient has mild or severe myocardial ischemia, because there are many cases of severe coronary artery blockage that progress silently, while there are patients with partial coronary artery blockage. Signs of severe pain appeared (3). Therefore, to accurately diagnose the condition, doctors often prescribe patients to perform a number of paraclinical methods including:\nBlood biochemical tests: Patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy often have metabolic disorders. Therefore, patients need to check fasting blood sugar, blood fat, liver enzymes, blood creatinine.; Electrocardiogram: helps doctors early diagnose changes expressed on the electrocardiogram as well as possible arrhythmias.; Exercise electrocardiogram (ischemic ECG): is a non-invasive test that helps diagnose possible coronary artery disease in patients with risk factors.; Computed tomography (MSCT): This technique helps score coronary calcification, showing coronary images when contrast is used. MSCT technique is often indicated when patients are at average risk of the disease.; Coronary angiography: This method is considered the gold standard in diagnosing ischemic cardiomyopathy, helping doctors determine the anatomical location as well as the severity of coronary artery stenosis. Biomarker (Troponin): Cardiac Troponin test helps doctors distinguish acute coronary syndrome and other heart diseases. .; Doppler echocardiography: Echocardiography can identify regional motion abnormalities suspected to be caused by coronary artery disease, evaluate left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) to stratify risk and evaluate left ventricular diastolic function. ,…\nMSCT is a technique that helps doctors diagnose moderate myocardial ischemia",
