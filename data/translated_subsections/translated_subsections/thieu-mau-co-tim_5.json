    "subsection_content": "Change your lifestyle\nApplying a scientific lifestyle and eliminating bad habits not only helps the body prevent many diseases but also contributes significantly to the treatment process. Practicing a healthy lifestyle is very good for the patient's treatment process.\nPatients should limit smoking, eat more vegetables and fruits, exercise regularly, limit stress and fatigue, and try to control diseases such as dyslipidemia, diabetes, and high blood pressure. ,... for the most convenient and effective treatment process. Besides, patients should closely follow the regimen given by the doctor.\nUse medication as prescribed by your doctor\nUsing medication is one of the common methods prescribed by doctors in treating patients with myocardial ischemia. Usually, doctors will prescribe a number of medications including:\nCalcium channel blockers; Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) group; Ranolazine (Ranexa); Aspirin; Nitrate group; Beta blocker group\nNote: To achieve the highest effectiveness, the patient must closely follow the doctor's treatment instructions. Patients should not arbitrarily use medication or stop medication without a doctor's prescription to avoid unwanted consequences.\nSurgery\nFor patients with severe myocardial ischemia, drug treatment sometimes does not bring optimal results. In this case, doctors often prescribe surgical intervention.\nCoronary artery bypass surgery: This method uses a vessel from another part of the body to create a graft to help blood circulate around the blocked coronary artery.; Dilation and stenting: With this method, the doctor will insert a thin catheter into the narrow part of the patient's artery. Then, using a wire, a small balloon is inserted into that narrow area and inflated to widen the artery. A small wire mesh coil (often called a stent) will be inserted to keep the artery open to help blood flow.; Modern mechanical treatment methods: These new methods are applied in cases where patients have serious conditions and have used other treatments but have not been effective.",
