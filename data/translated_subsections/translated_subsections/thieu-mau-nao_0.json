Global cerebral ischemia is a consequence of a systemic disease process, often causing shock.\nTotal cerebral ischemia\nSystemic hypotension is a common cause of global cerebral ischemia. Transient cerebral hypoperfusion may occur when the autonomic and neurohumoral mechanisms controlling blood pressure and heart rate are disrupted, as in vasovagal syncope and postural tachycardia. The second most common cause of transient ischemic attack is problems with the function and structure of the heart (especially arrhythmias). When the effect is transient, the condition often manifests as presyncope or syncope. On the other hand, prolonged global anemia can lead to permanent neurological damage.\nLocal cerebral ischemia\nIn contrast, focal cerebral ischemia usually arises due to obstruction of arterial blood flow to the brain, often as a result of thrombosis or embolism. If ischemia to the brain lasts long enough, loss of nerve cells will occur, leading to ischemic stroke. Ischemia also occurs when a thrombus forms from a narrowed internal carotid artery or cerebral atherosclerotic plaque.
