If symptoms of brief cerebral ischemia can resolve spontaneously before infarction occurs, it is called transient ischemic attack (TIA).\nWhen the brain is damaged due to cerebral ischemia, symptoms may appear permanently, including:\nBody weakness: On one side or both sides of the body.; Complete loss of sensation: On one side or both sides of the body.; Frequently disoriented and confused about simple issues in life; Change or decrease in vision in 1 eye or both eyes; Double vision: Usually occurs when the eyes are misaligned or not pointed at the same object, causing us to see two different images. Both images are sent to the brain which we process as double vision.; Sputter.; Loss or decreased consciousness; Impaired ability to coordinate and maintain balance.\nIn addition, headaches and dizziness are also common symptoms of cerebral anemia, and are easily confused with symptoms of other diseases.\nHeadache\nThis is a common symptom in anyone, at any age.
