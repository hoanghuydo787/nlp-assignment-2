This blood clot formation is mainly caused by atherosclerosis; Ischemia to the brain due to embolism: Blood clots formed from other locations have moved to the brain, causing embolism. Embolism originates from cardiovascular diseases such as: myocardial infarction, heart valve disease, atrial fibrillation,...; Hemodynamic cerebral anemia: Pathologies that affect blood circulation: blood clotting disorders, hypotension,...\nIn addition to the causes of the diseases mentioned above, the cause of anemia to the brain can stem from unhealthy living habits:\nAbuse of tobacco, alcohol, stimulants, etc.; Lack of exercise, lazy to exercise; Regularly eat foods high in fat, oil, and low fiber; The habit of resting your head too high when sleeping hinders the process of transporting blood to the brain.; Prolonged stress, working on the computer for too long.\nThe cause of cerebral anemia can come from cardiovascular and vascular diseases or from an unhealthy lifestyle",
