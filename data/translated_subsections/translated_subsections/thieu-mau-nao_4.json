This condition lasts for a few minutes and will cause nerve cells to gradually die.\nAnemia to the brain not only affects the patient's daily activities but also leads to the risk of stroke. Every year in Vietnam there are about 200,000 cases of stroke, of which the death rate accounts for about 50%. Patients who are lucky enough to survive a stroke have to live with serious sequelae: loss of voice, memory loss, paralysis on one side or the whole body, etc. The danger of ischemia to the brain is assessed based on the cause. , the severity of the disease and the patient's general health condition. Therefore, to minimize the danger of cerebral anemia, patients need to quickly go to the hospital for examination when their body appears symptoms of the disease.",
