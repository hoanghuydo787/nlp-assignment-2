Vascular imaging, such as CT-angiogram or MR-angiogram, can be very valuable in the acute setting. Vascular imaging can help determine the cause of stroke, especially in cases of large artery atherosclerosis; In cases of acute large vessel occlusion, the site of vascular occlusion can be clearly seen.\nOften in the setting of acute ischemic stroke, non-contrast head CT may show no obvious abnormalities, especially if the patient presents early in the course of the disease. In this case, perfusion MRI or CT may be valuable to determine the viability of ischemic tissue. Because the fate of ischemic neural tissue depends on both the extent and duration of ischemia, patients with acute cerebral ischemia often have an area of ​​brain tissue that is infarcted (core infarction). surrounded by a larger area of ​​ischemic brain that may remain. Feasibility. This area of ​​possibility is called the twilight zone. There have been many studies over the past decade involving neuroimaging modalities to determine ischemic penumbra volume.\nDifferential diagnosis for ischemic stroke-like symptoms, including: hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances such as hyponatremia, drug use, infections including meningitis, syncope due to heart disease, TIAs, vasculitis, migraines, tumors, brain hemorrhage, and seizures.\nTo be able to diagnose cerebral anemia accurately, patients need to go to a medical facility to see a doctor directly. The doctor will examine and prescribe the patient to perform a number of clinical tests, based on which an accurate diagnosis of the condition can be made.\nWhen coming to the hospital for examination, the doctor will prescribe the patient to perform clinical tests to diagnose cerebral anemia.",
