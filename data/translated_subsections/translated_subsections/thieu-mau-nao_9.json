    "subsection_content": "Symptoms of cerebral anemia that have not progressed to a severe level will be manifested by: transient headaches, nausea, numbness in the limbs or face, etc. Most of the symptoms of cerebral anemia will go away on their own after 10 to 20 minutes. Relatives need to learn about treatment measures to keep the patient from falling into a dangerous state. When the above symptoms appear, people can lay the patient on a well-ventilated surface, head low, and loosen clothing so that blood can circulate to the brain better. Immediately then quickly take the patient to the nearest medical facility for a doctor to examine and treat as soon as possible. In addition, relatives need to closely monitor the lifestyle and diet and support patients with cerebral anemia to stay away from factors that easily lead to stroke such as: bathing at night, staying up late, stress, etc.\nPeople with cerebral anemia are increasingly getting younger, so anyone can become a victim of this disease. Everyone needs to understand the symptoms of cerebral anemia so that they can quickly visit a medical facility when they discover that their body has many signs of cerebral anemia. Absolutely do not self-treat cerebral anemia at home without a doctor's prescription because this disease can lead to stroke at any time.",
