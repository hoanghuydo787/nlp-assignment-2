    "subsection_content": "G6PD deficiency is a genetic condition caused by mutations or changes in the G6PD gene. This gene functions to ensure the body produces enough G6PD enzyme. Therefore, if the G6PD gene is mutated, it will reduce the amount of this useful protein in the body. (first)\nG6PD deficiency is an X-linked recessive congenital disease; boys are twice as likely to have the disease as girls. In the world, it is estimated that nearly 400 million people are deficient in G6PD enzyme. This number in Vietnam is not small: it is estimated that for every 1,000 children born, there are 4 children with G6PD deficiency.\nChildren with this G6PD deficiency will have very little G6PD in their red blood cells. When exposed to certain drugs, oxidizing chemicals, food or when infected, red blood cells easily break (called hemolysis), leading to anemia when there are very few red blood cells in the body.\nHemolysis occurs at different levels. Mild hemolysis is difficult to detect, but if prolonged, it can affect the heart, kidneys, liver, eyes and can be life-threatening. Symptoms of severe hemolysis include:\nYellow skin, yellow eyes;; Shortness of breath;; Cardiac arrhythmia;; Dark yellow urine;; Dizziness, exhaustion;; Abdominal pain, back pain;; Fever.\nNewborns with G6PD deficiency may develop jaundice within 3-6 days after birth. If severe, this time will last longer, leading to brain disease or neurological complications, delayed mental and motor development.",
