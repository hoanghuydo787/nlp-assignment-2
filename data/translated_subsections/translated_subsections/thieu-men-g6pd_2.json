    "subsection_content": "When lacking the G6PD enzyme, red blood cells will be destroyed when exposed to oxidants in food or medicine. Hemolysis increases the amount of bilirubin in the blood, causing jaundice, yellow eyes, anemia in children, and kidney failure. When a child has severe jaundice, especially in the first 2 weeks after birth, the child can suffer brain damage causing cerebral palsy and mental retardation. In many cases of severe enzyme deficiency, children suffer from severe anemia, fatigue, accompanied by symptoms of liver and kidney failure, and can lead to death if not treated promptly.\nG6PD deficiency in newborns is not dangerous if detected early.",
