    "subsection_content": "G6PD deficiency is a genetic disorder – meaning it's passed from parent to child – characterized by an enzyme defect caused by a mutated G6PD gene. The defective gene that causes this deficiency is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. Men have only one X chromosome, while in women, the number of X chromosomes is two. (2)\nFava beans are considered one of the foods that cause symptoms of G6PD deficiency\nIn men, just one altered copy of the gene is enough to cause G6PD deficiency. However, in women, when both copies of the gene are changed, a mutation occurs. Because it is less likely for women to have two altered copies of this gene, it is much more common for men to be affected by G6PD deficiency than for women.\nRisk factors that contribute to the development of symptoms of hemolytic anemia associated with G6PD deficiency include:\nIllness, including viral or bacterial infection; Taking certain medications causes negative reactions, contributing to the destruction of red blood cells faster than the body can produce them.; Eat certain foods.; There is a family history of this condition.",
