    "subsection_content": "Treatment of G6PD deficiency depends on the symptoms. Children may receive a blood transfusion if anemic, or phototherapy for jaundice when indicated.\nWhen symptoms of G6PD deficiency are mild, the most effective treatment is to avoid foods or medications that are known to cause symptoms. Specifically:\n1. Avoid taking certain medications\nYour doctor will provide you with a complete list of medications that are “Unsafe for people with G6PD deficiency.” Some popular medications include:\nAnti-malarial drugs; Aspirin; NSAID pain relievers (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs); Sulfate drugs and products containing sulfites (drugs with “sulf” in the name should be used with caution); Quinine, or other drugs with “quin” in the name; Brinzolamide; Furazolidone; Dimercaprol; Sulfadimidine\nIf you are diagnosed with G6PD deficiency and see a doctor for another health problem, inform your doctor about your condition to avoid being prescribed a drug on the \"Unsafe\" list above. Also, ask your doctor about any vitamins or supplements you want to take.\n2. Avoid consuming foods and drinks that can cause reactions\nNot all people with G6PD deficiency react to foods and drinks that are considered \"forbidden\" for people with G6PD deficiency. But it's best to avoid consuming them to avoid making your condition worse. The list of foods/drinks to avoid is:\nfava beans (sometimes all other beans too); Blueberry; All products made from soy (tofu, tofu, miso, tempeh); Foods rich in vitamin C as well as foods supplemented with vitamin C such as citrus fruits, drinks containing synthetic vitamin C...; Menthol; Foods containing artificial dyes\nNote, people with G6PD deficiency can use fruits such as tomatoes, oranges, grapes, and apples that contain antioxidants. As for intravenous Vitamin C, be cautious if methemoglobin is present.\nIf G6PD deficiency is caused by infectious diseases such as viral hepatitis, typhoid, pneumonia, etc., these diseases need to be treated thoroughly. Then, the symptoms will gradually disappear.\nHowever, once G6PD deficiency has progressed to hemolytic anemia, the patient needs immediate aggressive treatment. It's likely your doctor will prescribe a blood transfusion to help slow the rate at which red blood cells are destroyed (hemolysis). During treatment, the patient needs to stay in the hospital to be closely monitored. This is to ensure complete recovery without complications.",
