    "subsection_content": "Ankle osteoarthritis is a condition in which joint cartilage wears away over time, causing the bones to rub against each other when moving, accompanied by an inflammatory reaction, causing pain, stiffness and other symptoms for the patient. This condition not only affects cartilage but can also damage the bones, ligaments, and tendons around the joint. (first)\nThe disease can appear at any age, but is most common in people over 45 years old and is more common in women than men.\nThe structure of the ankle joint is quite special, including 3 joint surfaces: the talus on the outside, the tibia talus on the top and the medial malleolus - talus on the inside. The area of ​​the ankle joint surface is small, about 350mm. The thickness of the ankle joint cartilage is not much, in some places it is less than 1mm, so the pressure on the ankle joint cartilage is very large. However, the breaking force and stiffness of cartilage are many times higher than those of the knee and hip, so the ankle joint is less susceptible to primary degeneration than the knee and hip joint. Degeneration of the ankle joint is mainly due to secondary causes after injury.\nThe risk of developing ankle osteoarthritis is often related to:\nOverweight and obesity; Genetic factors in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout.",
