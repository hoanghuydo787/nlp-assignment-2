    "subsection_content": "According to musculoskeletal experts, Orthopedics Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, there are many causes of ankle osteoarthritis. Determining the exact cause of the disease will help doctors make an accurate diagnosis and provide effective treatment.\n1. Age\nOsteoarthritis can appear at any stage in life, but is most common in older people. Time causes the articular cartilage layers to erode, become thinner, less flexible and susceptible to degeneration.\n2. Injury: rupture/tear of the ankle ligament\nAnkles are especially susceptible to sprains, fractures and other injuries during daily activities, playing sports, working... Injured joints are at risk of inflammation and degeneration up to 7 times more than other joints. time. Some statistics show that 70-80% of cases of ankle joint degeneration occur in previously injured ankles.\nUsually the damage will heal and leg joint function is restored. However, trauma can also lead to changes in the joint and promote a faster rate of degeneration. In particular, the risk of degeneration can also occur, even after the injury has been properly treated. Symptoms of osteoarthritis in the ankle usually appear about 2 years after the injury, but in some cases decades later.\n3. Underlying medical conditions\nSome cases of ankle osteoarthritis are related to an underlying medical condition. Conditions that may increase the risk of developing the disease include:\nRheumatoid arthritis and reactive arthritis. These systemic joint diseases can cause bone and joint damage over time; Hematological diseases such as hemophilia, hemoglobinopathies; Clubfoot or other congenital foot defects result in poor ankle joint alignment; Avascular necrosis and osteonecrosis make the bones and cartilage of the ankle joint vulnerable to damage due to poor blood circulation.\n4. Unknown cause\nSome cases of ankle degeneration that are not caused by injury or a previous medical condition are called primary ankle arthritis. This condition usually accounts for about 10% of cases. People with primary ankle osteoarthritis tend to have less pain and better range of motion than others.\n5. Risk factors for developing osteoarthritis in the ankle\nJoint stress and minor injuries: Often appear in people whose activities regularly cause stress to the ankles such as ballet dancers, players, etc.; Overweight and obesity: The ankle joint carries a load 5 times greater than our body weight when we walk. Therefore, the more a person weighs, the more vulnerable the ankle joint is; Family history: Osteoarthritis is affected by genetic factors. Therefore, people whose parents have osteoarthritis will have a higher risk of developing the disease than others.",
