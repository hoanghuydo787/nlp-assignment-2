Hallux Hardus syndrome\nIf ankle osteoarthritis is not treated, the cartilage can wear away completely.

Arthritis deformity of the big toe (Bunion)\nHallux ankylosing spondylitis can cause the big toe to tilt toward the other toes, called hallux valvular arthritis. Patients may experience redness, swelling, and instability when standing or walking.\n3.
