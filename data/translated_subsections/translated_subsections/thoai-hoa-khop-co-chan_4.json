    "subsection_content": "To determine this condition, your doctor will take time to ask your medical history, perform a clinical examination, and may prescribe the following measures.\n1. Clinical examination\nThe doctor will examine the patient's ankle symptoms, ask about medical history and health status. The patient is also asked to walk to see their gait and the extent of the impact of osteoarthritis.\n2. Imaging diagnosis\nDiagnostic imaging measures are also indicated so that the doctor can have more information about the extent of arthritis and/or rule out other possible causes of ankle pain.\nX-ray\nX-rays will show narrowing of the ankle joint space, loss of cartilage in the ankle, and bone spurs, a sign that the loss of cartilage is being compensated for by additional bone growth.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nMagnetic resonance imaging results provide images of the soft tissues (ligaments, tendons and muscles) and bones in the ankle area. Thanks to that, the doctor can rule out the cause of osteoarthritis, damage to the ligaments or tendons in the ankle.\nBlood tests\nIn some cases, your doctor may also order blood tests to rule out other forms of arthritis.",
