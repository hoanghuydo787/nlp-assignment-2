Articular cartilage is considered a cushion covering the bone surface, made of cartilage cells and basic substances. Articular cartilage has a protective function, reducing friction in the joint and acting as a \"shock absorber\".\nDegeneration of the joints is the most common of more than 100 different types of arthritis. The condition affects approximately 27 million Americans and nearly everyone over the age of 80. Younger men are more susceptible to osteoarthritis due to injury. However, after age 70, the incidence is equal between both sexes. According to research, this condition is also related to racial issues. Research results show that the rate of osteoarthritis in Japanese people is quite high while black people in North Africa, East Indians and Northern people In China, the infection rate is very low. (first)\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the period from 2011 to 2020 is considered the \"Decade of bones and joints\" by the World Health Organization (WHO). Particularly in Vietnam, according to estimates in a study on osteoarthritis, this condition is increasingly common and showing signs of rejuvenation.
