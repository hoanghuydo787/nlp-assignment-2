The bones of the knee joint that are no longer protected by the cartilage layer rub against each other, causing pain, inflammation, and limiting movement. In many cases, degenerative arthritis promotes bone spurs on the knee joint to form, leading to knee osteoarthritis and worsening.\n2. Hip osteoarthritis\nPatients with degenerative hip disease often have difficulty walking.
