    "subsection_content": "Primary cause\nOsteoarthritis occurs in relation to age. The water content in articular cartilage gradually increases with age. This causes the content and quality of Protein in the cartilage to decrease, leading to the articular cartilage beginning to degenerate. Exercising for a long time causes this cartilage to be damaged, causing cracking, peeling and even cartilage loss, increasing friction between joints, causing pain and degeneration.\nSecondary cause\nGenetics: This condition occurs in some subjects with genetic defects in genes that function to form cartilage. This leads to loss of joint cartilage, accelerating degeneration; Obesity: Being overweight increases the risk of degeneration in the knee, hip and spine joints. Therefore, maintaining body mass index or losing weight to the ideal weight helps prevent degeneration as well as reduce the rate of progression when the disease begins to form.; Injury:  This is considered a favorable condition for the development of degenerative arthritis.; High-frequency joint overuse: Overuse of certain joints increases the risk of developing osteoarthritis. For example, people who often work hard with their hands and feet, such as loading and unloading, or doing manual work, have a higher risk of developing osteoarthritis of the wrists and ankles.; Affected by other bone and joint diseases: People with rheumatoid arthritis are more likely to develop osteoarthritis. Additionally, some rare conditions, such as iron overload or growth hormone excess, increase the chance of developing the disease.",
