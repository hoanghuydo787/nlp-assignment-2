    "subsection_content": "There is no cure for osteoarthritis, but the condition does not necessarily get worse over time. There are a number of treatments to help reduce symptoms of joint pain caused by degenerative arthritis.\nDo exercise\nThis is the most important treatment for people with degenerative arthritis. Recommended exercises include a combination of activities that help strengthen muscles and improve fitness.\nMany people think that exercising will make the pain caused by the disease worse, increasing the risk of joint stiffness. However, regular exercise helps you move, build muscle and strengthen normal joints. helps improve symptoms. Physical training is also a great aid for losing weight, adjusting posture, reducing stress and especially effectively improving symptoms.\nYour doctor, or a physical therapist, will discuss the benefits you may get from exercise and may give you an exercise plan to follow at home. The training process needs to follow the given plan to avoid incorrect exercises that can negatively affect the joints.\nLosing weight\nBeing overweight or obese makes osteoarthritis worse. To know whether you are overweight or obese, you can use appropriate weight calculators.\nIf you are overweight or obese, try to lose weight by participating in physical activity and eating a healthier diet.\nAnalgesic\nSome pain relievers may be recommended by your doctor as part of your treatment to improve symptoms. The type of pain medication will depend on the severity of your pain and any other health conditions or problems you have. Some recommended medications include:\nParacetamol\nIf you have pain from osteoarthritis, your doctor may recommend paracetamol as treatment. When taking paracetamol, always use the dose recommended by your GP and do not exceed the maximum dose stated on the packaging.\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nIf using paracetamol does not help you effectively control your pain, your doctor may prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\nNSAIDs are pain relievers that work by reducing inflammation, some NSAIDs are available as creams that you can apply directly to affected joints. In addition to helping relieve pain, they can also help reduce joint swelling.\nYour doctor will discuss with you the type of NSAID you should take and the benefits and risks associated with it.\nNSAID tablets may be needed if paracetamol and NSAID creams do not relieve the pain. They may not be suitable for people with certain conditions such as asthma, stomach ulcers or angina, heart attack or stroke. If you are taking low-dose aspirin, ask your doctor whether you should use NSAIDs.\nIf your doctor recommends or prescribes an NSAID to take by mouth, he or she will usually also prescribe a medicine called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to take at the same time. NSAIDs can break down the lining in the stomach to protect it from stomach acid. PPIs reduce the amount of acid produced by the stomach, reducing the risk of damage to your stomach lining.\nSteroid injections\nSteroids are a type of medication that contain man-made versions of the hormone cortisol and are sometimes used to treat particularly painful musculoskeletal problems.\nSome people with osteoarthritis are recommended steroid injections when other treatments have not had positive results. The injection will be made directly into the affected area. You may be given a local anesthetic first to numb and relieve pain. Steroid injections work quickly and can relieve pain within weeks or months.\nUse autologous platelet-rich plasma\nUsing PRP to treat joint problems is a modern solution researched for quick effectiveness with natural self-healing ability, safe for the patient.\nApply hot or cold compresses\nApplying heat or cold to joints may reduce the pain and symptoms of osteoarthritis in some people. You can prepare yourself with a bottle of water or a hot and cold compress and apply it directly to the painful area.\nSupport equipment\nIf degenerative arthritis is causing mobility problems or making it difficult to carry out daily tasks, a number of devices can help treat and improve this. If you have a degenerative condition in your lower extremities, such as your hips, knees or feet, your physical therapist will recommend specialized shoes for you.\nSpecialized shoes with shock-absorbing soles can help relieve some of the pressure on the joints in your feet as you walk. Special lining can help disperse your weight more evenly. Splints and foot supports work the same way. If osteoarthritis in the hips or knees affects mobility, you may need to use a walking aid such as a cane or crutches. Manual therapy\nInfrequent movement and use of muscles can increase stiffness caused by osteoarthritis. This therapy is a technique that uses your hands to stretch and massage body tissues to keep your joints supple and flexible.\nSurgery\nSurgery to treat osteoarthritis is only necessary in a small number of cases where other treatments have failed or the joint is seriously damaged. This surgery can significantly improve your symptoms, mobility, and quality of life.\nJoint replacement\nJoint replacement is joint reconstruction surgery, which can be applied to most joints such as knees, hips, fingers, etc. During joint replacement surgery, the doctor will remove the damaged joint and replace it with an artificial joint made of special biomedical materials. The lifespan of an artificial joint can last 15-20 years or more.",
