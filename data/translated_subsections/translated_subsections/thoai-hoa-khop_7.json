As researchers work to understand the causes of osteoarthritis, they can offer advice to help prevent the disease or its progression and reduce its impact on your life.\nWeight control\nIf you are at a healthy weight, maintaining that weight can help you prevent developing the disease. If you are overweight, losing weight may be the best method of preventing osteoarthritis.\nAccording to data from NHANES, obese women are nearly 4 times more likely to develop osteoarthritis than normal women. The risk for obese men is nearly five times higher than for non-obese men. Losing as little as 5% of your body weight can reduce stress on your knees, hips, and lower back.\nGet healthy through exercise\nA scientific exercise regimen helps improve health condition as well as enhance flexibility and suppleness of joints. However, to avoid unnecessary injuries, you should exercise at a reasonable intensity, accompanied by a guide to avoid incorrect movements that affect the joints.\nAvoid injury\nInjuring a joint at a young age can lead to osteoarthritis of the same joint as you get older. To avoid joint injuries when exercising or playing sports, keep these recommendations in mind:\nDo not bend more than 90 degrees when performing knee bends.; Always keep your feet as flat as possible while stretching to avoid knee injuries.; When jumping, land with bent knees.; Warm up before participating in sports or physical activities; Wear shoes that fit well.; Exercise on soft surfaces with friction, avoid exercising on hard surfaces such as asphalt roads or concrete yards.\nIf you have a joint injury, it is important to get prompt medical treatment and take steps to avoid further damage.\nHealthy eating\nWhile no specific diet has been shown to prevent the disease, certain nutrients have been linked to reducing the risk of the disease or the severity of the condition, such as supplementation. Omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, eat lots of green vegetables, fruits and limit high-temperature processed foods.\nReference: What should you eat and avoid with osteoarthritis?",
