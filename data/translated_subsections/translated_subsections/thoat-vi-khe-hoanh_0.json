    "subsection_content": "Hiatal hernia is a condition in which part of the stomach protrudes into the chest. Normally the stomach is located below the diaphragm, a thin dome-shaped muscle that separates the organs in the chest and abdomen. The esophagus is a tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach, and this tube passes through a hole in the diaphragm to the abdomen. When there is a hiatal hernia, the stomach passes through that hole into the chest. (2)\nThe disease is often divided into 4 types, including:\nType I: often called sliding hernia, occurs when the esophageal-stomach junction (cardium) slides above the diaphragm. This is the most common form of hiatal hernia and causes symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux.; Type II: the highest part of the stomach (fundus) slides up over the diaphragm.; Form III: is a combination of forms I and II; Type IV: large hernia hole, in addition to the stomach, other organs such as the colon, spleen, pancreas, and small intestine can also crawl into the chest.\nTypes II, III, IV are variants of paraesophageal hernia, accounting for 5-15% of diaphragmatic hernia cases. This condition is rare but can be serious if the stomach is at an angle. Paraesophageal hernias can cause stomach bleeding or difficulty breathing.\nTypes of hiatal hernia\nVietsub: Hiatal hernia: diaphragmatic hernia Normal: normal Normal diaphragm: normal diaphragm Weak diaphragm: weak diaphragm Sliding hiatal hernia: sliding hernia Rolling hiatal hernia: rolling hernia Paraesophageal hiatal hernia: paraesophageal hernia",
