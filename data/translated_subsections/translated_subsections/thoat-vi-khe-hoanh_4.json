    "subsection_content": "1. Medical treatment\nIf a hiatal hernia does not cause symptoms, it usually does not require treatment. For cases that cause symptoms, doctors will use medications commonly used for gastroesophageal reflux.\nAntacids are often used for cases of hiatal hernia with gastroesophageal reflux.\n2. Treat diaphragmatic hernia with surgery\nSometimes, a hiatal hernia requires surgery. Surgery is often used for patients who are ineffective on medication, or have complications such as severe inflammation or esophageal strictures.\nSurgery to repair a hiatal hernia may include pulling the stomach and herniated organs down into the abdomen, making the opening of the diaphragm smaller, and possibly creating an anti-reflux valve. In some cases, hiatal hernia surgery is combined with weight loss surgery, such as sleeve gastrectomy.\nCurrently, diaphragmatic hernia surgery is often performed through laparoscopy, which is a minimally invasive surgery. In it, the surgeon will use a number of small incisions in the abdomen to insert specialized tools into the abdominal cavity. The doctor performs the operation while viewing magnified images of the patient's internal organs displayed on a video screen.\nLifestyle measures\nSome measures that can help control symptoms of acid reflux include:\nEat more meals and less food at each meal instead of overeating; Avoid eating some foods that make reflux worse such as fatty foods, fried foods, alcohol, coffee, chocolate, onions, garlic.; Avoid lying down right after eating or eating late at night before bed; Stop smoking; Raise the head of the bed when sleeping (about 15cm)\nAnd the most important thing is that people should have regular health checks to screen and detect diseases early so they can be treated effectively.\nGastrointestinal Endoscopy & Surgery Center at Tam Anh General Hospital is a reputable unit for examination and surgical treatment of digestive diseases, including extra-gastrointestinal diseases such as hiatal hernia. .
