    "subsection_content": "If the hole is small, it usually will not cause any dangerous complications. Some small openings will close on their own when the child is 1-4 years old. If the hole is large, it can cause serious complications such as:\nRight-sided heart failure; Heart arrhythmia; Increased risk of stroke; Reduce life expectancy\nLess common serious complications are:\nPulmonary hypertension: If a large atrial septal defect is not treated, the increased blood flow to the lungs will increase blood pressure in the pulmonary artery (pulmonary hypertension).; Eisenmenger syndrome: This is the development of pulmonary hypertension due to an untreated congenital heart defect. The disease can cause complications including permanent heart and lung damage.; Atrial septal defects rarely cause complications of pulmonary hypertension and especially Eisenmenger syndrome. Therefore, if detected, other causes of pulmonary hypertension or accompanying primary pulmonary hypertension must be screened.",
