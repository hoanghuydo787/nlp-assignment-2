    "subsection_content": "Ventricular septal defect is a condition in which increased flow and pressure in the pulmonary circulation leads to difficulty breathing, poor appetite, and slow weight gain in most children. Ostomy occlusion or early surgery may be recommended if pulmonary pressure increases. Some openings can gradually decrease in size and have less impact on the heart, allowing surgery to be delayed until the child is older. (first)\nVentricular septal defect is one of the four tetralogy of Fallot - the most common congenital heart disease.\nThe normal heart consists of 4 chambers. The two upper chambers act as reservoirs, collecting blood back to the heart. They are called atria. From the atria, blood travels to the two lower chambers, called the ventricles. Blood is pumped into large arteries according to the heartbeat. The large artery originating from the right heart is called the pulmonary artery, which carries blood to the lungs. Meanwhile, the large artery originating from the left heart called the aorta carries blood throughout the body.\nThe two ventricles are separated by a common wall, called the interventricular septum. Children born with a ventricular septal defect will have a hole in the ventricular septum. Then, oxygen-rich blood (red) passes from the left ventricle through the opening in the septum and mixes with low-oxygen blood (blue) in the right ventricle. This can increase pressure in the pulmonary blood vessels.",
