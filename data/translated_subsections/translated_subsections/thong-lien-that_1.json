    "subsection_content": "Based on the location and structure of the hole, medical science divides ventricular septal defects into 4 main types:\nMembranous ventricular septal defect: This is the most common type, accounting for about 80% of ventricular septal defect cases. In this type, the opening is located at the upper part of the interventricular septum; Muscular ventricular septal defect: The hole is surrounded by muscle tissue and can occur anywhere in the ventricular septum; Receiving chamber ventricular septal defect: The opening is located just below the tricuspid valve in the right ventricle and the mitral valve in the left ventricle. That means that when blood enters the ventricles, it must pass through the opening between the two chambers.; Infundibular ventricular septal defect: This type of ventricular septal defect creates a hole just in front of the pulmonary valve in the right ventricle and in front of the aortic valve in the left ventricle, connecting the two chambers together. Thus, blood must flow through the ostium on its way through both valves.",
