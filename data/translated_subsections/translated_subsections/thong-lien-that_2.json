    "subsection_content": "Signs and symptoms of ventricular septal defect usually appear in the first few days, weeks, or months of a child's life. They include:\nEat poorly, do not gain weight; Rapid breathing, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing; Fatigue, weakness; Blue-purple skin, lips and nails\nIf the ventricular septal defect is small, the above symptoms may not appear until the child is an adult. This is why sometimes the disease is not detected at birth. If you are lucky, your baby will have a ventricular septal defect detected using ultrasound technology in the womb.\nImage of a normal heart and a heart with a ventricular septal defect",
