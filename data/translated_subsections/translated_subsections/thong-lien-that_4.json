    "subsection_content": "Ventricular septal defect is usually diagnosed at birth or a few days after birth if the doctor hears a heart murmur during a physical examination of the baby. Older children or adults who are suspected of having a ventricular septal defect will be assigned the following paraclinical diagnoses:\nChest X-ray;; An electrocardiogram to evaluate the heart's electrical system;; Transthoracic echocardiography with Doppler imaging: The ultrasound images obtained will display the size and function of the heart chambers, evaluate the condition of the heart valves and measure the blood flow velocity through the VSD;; Coronary angiography in patients at risk of coronary artery disease or in patients over 40 years of age if surgical repair is planned;; Magnetic resonance imaging to detect other heart-related abnormalities.\nMRI scan helps detect abnormalities related to the heart",
