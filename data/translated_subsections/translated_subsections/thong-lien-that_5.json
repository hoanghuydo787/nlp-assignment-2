    "subsection_content": "A small ventricular septal defect is likely to close on its own as the child grows older. However, a medium or large ostomy will cause many complications for the child – from mild to life-threatening. These complications are usually:\nHeart failure: If the ventricular septal defect is medium or large in size, the heart has to work harder to pump enough blood to the body. Therefore, heart failure can develop if a child with a ventricular septal defect is not treated properly.; Pulmonary hypertension: Increased blood flow to the lungs due to a ventricular septal defect causes high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries (pulmonary hypertension), which can permanently damage them. More dangerously, this complication also has the risk of causing a reversal of blood flow through the hole (Eisenmenger syndrome).; Endocarditis: This complication is less common but can still occur.; Other heart problems, including abnormal heart rhythms and heart valve problems.",
