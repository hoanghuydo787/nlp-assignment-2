    "subsection_content": "Small ventricular septal defects (VSD) usually do not require treatment because the hole will close on its own as the child grows older. About 75% of children with VSD will close on their own within the first year of life or before age 10 without needing medical intervention. For medium and large sized ventricular septal defects, the spontaneous closure rate is 5 – 10%. If a ventricular septal defect has not closed before age 10, spontaneous closure is very rare. At this time, treatment methods include: (3)\nMedicines to help the heart work better: Digoxin, diuretics; Antibiotics to prevent infective endocarditis; Nutrition to help children gain weight, nutrition with high calories or breast milk with additional nutrients.; Cardiac closure catheterization: The device is inserted into the hole through a small tube, called a catheter. The instrument is then opened to cover the opening. This procedure only requires a small injection (2 - 3mm) and does not require open heart surgery.; Open-heart surgery to close the opening: The surgeon sews or patches the openings in the septum. This is an option when the child cannot close the hole with cardiac catheterization.",
