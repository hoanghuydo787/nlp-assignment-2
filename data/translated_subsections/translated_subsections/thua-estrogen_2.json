Symptoms of excess estrogen in men include:\nMale infertility: Estrogen is partly responsible for the production of healthy sperm. If estrogen levels are high, sperm levels are likely to decrease, leading to fertility problems.; Breast enlargement: Estrogen can stimulate tissue growth in the breast. Therefore, when men have too much estrogen, it will lead to larger breasts.; Erectile dysfunction: Men with high levels of estrogen may have difficulty achieving an erection.",
