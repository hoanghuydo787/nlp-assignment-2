    "subsection_content": "In a normal state, amniotic fluid will completely stay in the amniotic chamber, not entering the pregnant woman's circulatory system. When the barrier between the amniotic cavity and the pregnant woman's circulation is broken, amniotic fluid will enter the pregnant woman's blood through the cervical canal veins, through the placenta's placenta, through the endometrium or uterus. Injury to the cervix leads to amniotic embolism. However, not all cases of amniotic fluid entering the pregnant woman's circulation cause blockage.\nAssociate Professor, Dr. Luu Thi Hong said that all ages can suffer from blocked amniotic vessels that occur before, during or immediately after birth. Medical records indicate that cases of amniotic embolism in pregnant women have common characteristics such as large fetuses, overdue pregnancies, pregnant women's anxiety, panic, difficulty breathing and vomiting. In addition, some factors that increase the risk of disease include:\nElderly pregnant women: Pregnant women over 35 years old;; Pregnant women with multiple pregnancies or multiple births;; Abnormal placenta: During pregnancy if structures in the uterus develop abnormally;; Pregnant women with pre-eclampsia: Pregnant women with pre-eclampsia, high blood pressure and proteinuria after the 20th week of pregnancy;; Caesarean section, or lower vaginal birth with the intervention of Forceps, traction cupping, or amniocentesis: Using forceps or other cesarean section procedures can break the physical barrier between pregnant woman and fetus. .\nPregnant women with the disease have things in common such as large fetuses, overdue pregnancies, etc.",
