In women with this syndrome, these blood vessels do not seem to develop or function properly. They are narrower than normal blood vessels, causing limited blood flow. The cause of this abnormal development is:\nInsufficient blood flow to the uterus;; Damage to blood vessels;; Immune system weakness or problems;; Some abnormal genes.",
