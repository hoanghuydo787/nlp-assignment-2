Dinh Thi Hien Le said that at Tam Anh General Hospital, the doctor will perform the following tests to determine whether you have this syndrome or not:\nMeasure blood pressure: For women who have never had high blood pressure, if the result is 140/90 or higher, it is determined to be high blood pressure. Because blood pressure changes throughout the day, your blood pressure will be measured multiple times at different times to get accurate results.\nRegularly measuring your blood pressure helps determine whether you are at risk or not\nProtein in urine: You will do a test to check the protein-creatinine ratio (creatinine is a waste product filtered out by the kidneys) in the urine.; Blood tests: If you are at high risk of the disease, your doctor will ask you to have regular blood tests, including a complete peripheral blood cell (CBC) analysis and liver and kidney function tests. This also helps screen for HELLP syndrome.; Tests to assess the baby's health: You will have an ultrasound to check the baby's development, to see if the baby is growing well or not.\nAfter undergoing a series of tests, if you are diagnosed with preeclampsia, you and your baby will be closely monitored throughout the remainder of your pregnancy to minimize complications.",
