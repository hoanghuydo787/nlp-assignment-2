    "subsection_name": "tien-san-giat.json_5_Preeclampsia complications are dangerous for mother and fetus",
    "subsection_content": "Common complications are:\n1. The fetus grows slowly\nThe disease affects the arteries that carry blood to the placenta. When the placenta does not receive enough blood, the fetus will not be provided with enough blood, oxygen and nutrients. This is the reason why babies grow slowly, become underweight and malnourished at birth.\n2. Premature birth\nIf your condition is severe, your doctor may advise you to give birth early to avoid danger to both mother and child. However, premature birth will cause the baby to encounter health problems such as weakened immune system, respiratory system, and other damaged organs. Therefore, pregnant women with this syndrome during pregnancy need to be examined regularly so that the doctor can determine the best time for the important labor.\n3. Vegetable peeling\nPreeclampsia increases the risk of placental abruption – a condition in which the placenta separates from the inner wall of the uterus before birth. A ruptured placenta can cause severe bleeding, threatening the life of both mother and baby.\n4. HELLP syndrome\nHELLP is hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells), high liver enzymes, and low platelet count. This is a serious complication of preeclampsia, occurring in 4 - 12% of pregnant mothers, dangerous to the lives of mother and baby.\nSymptoms of HELLP syndrome include nausea and vomiting, headache, and right upper abdominal pain. HELLP syndrome is especially dangerous because it causes serious damage to a number of other organ systems.\n5. Eclampsia\nWhen left uncontrolled, complications of eclampsia (preeclampsia plus seizures) are likely to occur. Eclampsia is considered one of the leading obstetric complications causing death for mother and baby. Therefore, as soon as signs of eclampsia appear (seizures, abdominal pain, unconsciousness), doctors need to intervene immediately regardless of the week of pregnancy.\n6. Damage to other organs\nPreeclampsia during pregnancy can cause damage to the kidneys, liver, lungs, heart, and eyes. Besides, it can easily cause stroke or brain injury. The degree of damage to organs depends on the severity of the disease.\n7. Cardiovascular disease\nThis disease increases the risk of heart and blood vessel disease for pregnant women in the future. The risk is even greater if you have had this problem multiple times or have given birth prematurely. To minimize this risk, after giving birth, try to maintain your ideal weight, eat lots of fruits and vegetables, exercise regularly and do not smoke.\nA diet rich in fruits and vegetables helps reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease later in life for women with preeclampsia",
