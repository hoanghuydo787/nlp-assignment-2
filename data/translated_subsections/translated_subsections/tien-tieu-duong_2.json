    "subsection_content": "Modern medicine has not found the exact cause of prediabetes, however, genetic factors play an important role. Another cause is a metabolic disorder in the body that causes glucose to \"stay\" and not be processed properly.\nMedicine can explain as follows, glucose is the body's main source of energy, created from the foods we eat every day. During that process, insulin (produced by the pancreas) plays a role in transporting and releasing glucose to cells. Excess glucose is stored as glycogen in the liver. Between meals or while sleeping, the liver converts glycogen into glucose through a process called glycogenesis, which helps the body maintain a steady flow of blood sugar to fuel cells. If the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, the cells cannot use insulin effectively, and the flow of glucose into the cells will be interrupted. At this time you are constantly hungry, thirsty, constantly eating and drinking but your body has no energy for life activities.\nEating a lot of sweet foods, starches, etc. can easily cause prediabetes.\nIn addition, people with the following factors are also at risk of prediabetes: (2)\nAfter 45 years old.; Having a parent or sibling in the family with type 2 diabetes; Men have a waist greater than 101.6 cm and women have a waist greater than 88.9 cm. When the waist circumference is larger than normal, the body faces the risk of insulin resistance. (3); Use a lot of red meat (beef, buffalo meat, beef, lamb, goat meat, venison...), processed foods, sugary drinks.; Eating less fruits, vegetables, legumes and being lazy to exercise; Overweight and obesity, especially belly fat, is the main risk factor for prediabetes. If the area between the muscles and around the abdomen has a lot of fatty tissue, it is more likely to be insulin resistant.; The body has high cholesterol, high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol and high LDL cholesterol.; If you have diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes), you and your baby are at higher risk of prediabetes.; Women with polycystic ovary syndrome often experience irregular menstruation, excessive hair growth, obesity, and metabolic disorders in the body.; People with sleep apnea are at risk of insulin resistance, which can easily lead to prediabetes.; Smoking can increase insulin resistance. People with prediabetes who do not quit smoking will continue to face the risk of type 2 diabetes. Smoking also increases the risk of other diabetes complications such as: pneumonia, tuberculosis, kidney failure,...\nWhen having the above signs, people should have regular check-ups with a doctor in the Department of Endocrinology - Diabetes to have tests performed, thereby monitoring their health and taking preventive measures. Doctors in the Department of Endocrinology - Diabetes, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City have extensive professional knowledge and experience helping patients detect pre-diabetes and prevent it at an early stage. Thereby, avoiding the progression to type 2 diabetes.\nOverweight and obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is the main risk factor for prediabetes.",
