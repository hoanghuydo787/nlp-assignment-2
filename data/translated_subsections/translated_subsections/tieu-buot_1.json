Urinary tract infection\nPainful urination is a common sign of urinary tract infection (Urinary Tract Infection - UTI). The cause of the disease is often due to bacteria living in the colon and anus such as E.Coli (accounting for 80% of the causes of the disease) that superinfect the patient's urinary tract through living, sexual intercourse... Inflammation in any organ in the urinary tract such as: bladder, ureters, urethra, kidneys... can cause pain when urinating.; Due to the short structure of the urethra, women are more at risk of urinary tract infections than men. People who are pregnant or postmenopausal often have disorders of the endocrine glands and are also susceptible to urinary tract infections.\n2. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)\nPainful urination can also be a sign of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including genital herpes, gonorrhea and chlamydia.; Sexually transmitted diseases sometimes have no symptoms, but can still spread to the urinary tract, causing the patient to have painful urination. Therefore, sexually active people should get tested to better control the disease.\n3. Prostatitis\nThis is a unique condition for men. When suffering from prostatitis, the patient has symptoms of painful urination, frequent urination, pain in the lower abdomen, and anal examination notes that the prostate gland is very tense and painful.\n4. Cystitis\nAnother cause of painful urination is cystitis, inflammation of the bladder mucosa, interstitial cystitis...

Medicine\nSome medications, such as cancer drugs and some antibiotics, can cause painful urination as a side effect.\n11. Hygiene products\nSometimes painful urination is not due to infection, but because the products the patient uses every day in the genital area have strong cleaning properties, causing irritation to the tissues in the vagina and penis. Chemicals found in laundry detergent and other cleaning products can also cause irritation and lead to painful urination.\nIn addition, the following factors can also increase the risk of painful urination:\nFemale; People with diabetes; Elderly; People with prostate diseases; Pregnant women; People with urinary catheters",
