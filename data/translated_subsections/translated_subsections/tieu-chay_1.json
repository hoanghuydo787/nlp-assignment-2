    "subsection_content": "Based on factors such as mechanism, duration of illness, severity as well as stool characteristics (watery, frothy, fatty, bloody, etc.), diarrhea can be classified differently. Depending on the time, there are acute and chronic diarrhea, based on the pathological mechanism, there are osmotic diarrhea and secretory diarrhea, based on the cause, there is infectious diarrhea or non-infectious diarrhea...\n1. Acute diarrhea\nThis condition is common in children of preschool age and early elementary school years. The disease appears suddenly, lasting about a week with symptoms of loose, watery stools and bowel movements more than 3 times a day. Acute diarrhea appears due to the body consuming inappropriate food or food contamination. In particular, Rotavirus is the main agent that makes the condition worse and threatens the child's life.(4)\n2. Chronic diarrhea\nAt the chronic level, the disease lasts more than 2 - 4 weeks. With a healthy person's body, this condition can cause inconvenience to daily life and become a serious health problem. However, if the immune system is weak or impaired, chronic diarrhea becomes a life-threatening risk.\n3. Osmotic diarrhea\nThis is a condition that occurs due to reduced absorption of electrolytes, fluids and nutrients. At mild to moderate levels, stool volume will range from about 250ml to 1 liter/day. In addition, failure to absorb a single nutrient such as lactose usually results in bloating rather than diarrhea, except in severe cases. Osmotic diarrhea will stop when the patient stops consuming those foods.\n4. Secretory diarrhea\nThis is a disorder of ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells, causing increased secretion and decreased absorption or both. In the case of secretory diarrhea, stopping the use of food is completely ineffective, the patient is forced to resort to medical treatment.",
