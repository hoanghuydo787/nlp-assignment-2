    "subsection_content": "According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 88% of diarrhea-related deaths are due to inadequate sanitation, unsafe water sources, and insufficient sanitation. Among them, Rotavirus is the leading cause of acute diarrhea. Specifically, this type of microorganism causes about 40% of hospitalizations in children under 5 years old. Causes can be divided into 2 groups: (1) Diarrhea caused by microbial infection (also known as infection, virus infection, parasitic infection); (2) Diarrhea group is NOT caused by infection.\n1. Infection with microorganisms that cause intestinal diseases (Bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi):\nPathogens entering the body from outside will cause irritation to the tissues in the digestive tract, leading to inflammation. This is the main cause of diarrhea, most commonly when the body consumes unhygienic food. Food sources containing Salmonella, Clostridium, staphylococcus bacteria, etc. will lead to poisoning. Not to mention, contact with polluted water sources, eating raw vegetables, salads, undercooked foods, etc. vegetables and fruits watered with dirty water and fresh feces will increase the risk of transmitting parasites and bacteria.\n2. Not maintaining hygiene\nPoor hygiene conditions are also one of the leading causes that increase the risk of spreading bacteria that cause infectious diarrhea. Therefore, keeping the living space, personal belongings, body, food, etc. clean is also a necessary measure to avoid harmful microorganisms from entering the digestive tract.\n3. Disturbance of resident intestinal microflora\nThe habit of overusing antibiotics will unintentionally destroy beneficial bacteria, leading to an imbalance in the intestinal microflora. From there, the ability to absorb nutrients is poor, intestinal motility increases, causing frequent bowel movements, loose, loose or unformed stools.\n4. Inability to absorb sugar (non-infectious diarrhea)\nMany people often experience the body's inability to tolerate sugars such as: Lactose, Glucose-Galactose, Fructose,... from milk, dairy products, honey, fruit,... This leads to the phenomenon of diabetes. Prolonged diarrhea if these foods are eaten. In addition, the body lacks the enzymes Sucrase-isomaltase, Lactase... which are also common causes of diarrhea.\n5. Food poisoning (diarrhea caused by toxins from food or microbial toxins in food)\nThis is a consequence of using spoiled, contaminated food or containing toxic additives. Food poisoning can have obvious symptoms such as: abdominal pain, severe diarrhea after eating, high fever, diarrhea, vomiting, etc. In many cases, even convulsions leading to lead to death if not treated promptly.(5)\n6. Irritable bowel syndrome (with diarrhea, not due to infection)\nIrritable bowel syndrome appears due to changes in eating habits, after taking certain medications or eating strange foods. Caused by excessive and prolonged intestinal spasms, causing food to move faster in the digestive tract. At this time, water will not be reabsorbed or excessively secreted from the intestinal mucosa, leading to sudden diarrhea.\n7. Colitis\nColitis patients often face digestive disorders, including diarrhea. The disease originates from the invasion and harm of agents such as: bacteria (Shigella, Samonella,...), parasites, fungi,... In addition, autonomic nervous disorders, chemical poisoning, and psychology Stress, pressure,... are also important causes that cannot be ignored.",
