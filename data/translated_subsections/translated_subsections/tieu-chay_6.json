This is the basic foundation for implementing appropriate and effective treatment methods later.\n1. Blood test\nThis is the most basic and common job. Testing complete blood count (CBC), inflammatory factors, blood electrolytes, liver and kidney function will help doctors diagnose the cause and provide appropriate treatment.\n2. Stool test\nDoctors can identify parasites, bacteria, and some viruses in stool cultures. Stool tests can also detect microscopic blood (red blood cells), white blood cells, and other clues to the diagnosis.\n3. Colonoscopy\nThrough colonoscopy, the doctor will be able to observe the entire colon and part of the small intestine to accurately determine the damage here and find the cause of diarrhea. In addition, the endoscope is also equipped with support tools to help take a biopsy (a small tissue sample) from the colon for laboratory testing.",
