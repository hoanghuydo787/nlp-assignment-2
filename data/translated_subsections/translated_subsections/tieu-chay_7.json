However, if the condition lasts for many days, is severe, gradually increases with serious symptoms, the patient needs to contact a doctor soon for timely examination and treatment. Some commonly used diarrhea treatment methods include:\n1. Replenish fluids and electrolytes\nThis is the first thing to do when you have diarrhea. Patients should use Oresol solution (ORS – Oral rehydration salts). This is a mixture of clean water, sugar, and salt, absorbed in the small intestine to replace lost water and electrolytes. In cases where drinking is not possible due to nausea or stomach pain, intravenous fluid administration is necessary.(6)\n2. Use antibiotics\nAntibiotics will provide effective treatment in cases of diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites. However, if the cause comes from a virus, this method is completely ineffective.\n3. Treat diseases that cause diarrhea\nMany cases of diarrhea appear as a symptom of another disease. For this condition, your doctor will prescribe treatment for that problem first.\n4. Adjust prescription and dosage of medication being used\nIf antibiotics are the main cause of diarrhea, reducing the dose or changing to another type is the fastest way to stop side effects.
