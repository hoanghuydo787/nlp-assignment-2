    "subsection_content": "The severity and potential danger of diarrhea have been recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC): “Children's diarrhea causes more deaths than malaria, measles, and AIDS combined.” Specifically, this disease can last from a few days to a week and does not have a major impact on health if handled properly. However, in the opposite case, the body is at risk of facing many serious problems such as coma, vascular collapse, exhaustion, malnutrition, dehydration, and even death. Some dangerous complications include:\nThe area around the anus is red and ulcerated due to frequent bowel movements.; Malnutrition: Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of malnutrition in children under 5 years old because of its direct impact on growth and cognitive development; Dehydration: This is a serious threat of diarrhea. In the early stages of the disease, water and electrolytes such as: Sodium, Chloride, Potassium, Bicarbonate,... will be lost through vomiting, sweat, urine, feces, and breathing. If replacement is not done, the body will easily experience convulsions, brain damage, and even death.",
