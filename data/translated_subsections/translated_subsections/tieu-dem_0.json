    "subsection_content": "A healthy adult's bladder can hold about 300 - 400ml of urine. When full, the bladder will stimulate transmission to the brain to create a urination reflex. During night sleep, the nerves will inhibit the bladder from contracting to create a urination reflex, helping to maintain good sleep.\nNocturia is a condition in which the patient frequently wakes up more than once to urinate. The incidence of the disease increases with age, especially in people over 50 years old. Therefore, when you wake up to urinate more than twice during the night, you should quickly see a doctor. Because this may be an initial symptom of kidney disease or some physiological function problem.",
