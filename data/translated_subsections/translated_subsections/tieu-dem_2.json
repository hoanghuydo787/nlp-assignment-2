    "subsection_content": "1. Nocturia due to fluid imbalance\nFrequent urination day and night\nIf there is a fluid imbalance in the body that causes urine output to increase above 40ml/kg/24 hours, the patient may have:\nDrinking too much water or alcohol; Have diabetes.; Hypercalcemia.; Chronic renal failure.\nFrequent urination at night\nNocturia is defined as nocturnal urine volume greater than 35% of the total 24-hour urine volume throughout the day. Causes include:\nDrink a lot of water and alcohol in the evening; Use diuretics close to bedtime.; Change in antidiuretic hormone secretion; Venous blood stasis causes edema; Congestive heart failure causes nocturnal fluid redistribution.\n2. Nocturia due to neurological problems\nAn adult's bladder capacity can hold 300 - 400ml of urine. When urine is excreted from the kidneys to fill the bladder, the body will have a reflex to urinate. Meanwhile, the bladder is controlled by the brain, spinal cord segments S1 and S2, and the peripheral nervous system. Therefore, nerve-related problems can also affect bladder function, leading to nocturia.\nSome neurological diseases\nNeurological disorders that often cause urinary retention, urinary incontinence, frequent urination or nocturia include:\nSpinal cord compression syndrome.; Scattered sclerosis in clusters; Parkinson's.\nIf a woman over 60 years old frequently experiences urinary retention after eliminating the cause of bladder obstruction, the doctor has reason to suspect neurological diseases.\nSleep apnea\nSleep disorders can be the cause of nocturia. Specifically, sleep apnea has the potential to increase the frequency of nocturia. Therefore, treating sleep apnea will help improve nocturia.\nYou may be interested in: Sleep disorders in children\n3. Nocturia due to lower urinary tract disorders\nThe urine concentration function helps you sleep through the night without interruption. This function will become less effective with age. In addition, prostate enlargement and urinary problems can also cause inflammation, weakening the bladder and poor urine retention, thereby increasing nocturia. Specific causes include:\nUrethral disease causes obstruction of flow from the bladder.; Overactive bladder.; Too sensitive due to illness or pregnancy.; Interstitial cystitis.; Urinary tract infection.\n4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia is a common cause of nocturia. The disease affects 50% of men between the ages of 51 and 60. This rate increases to 90% in patients over 80 years old.\nThe prostate gland surrounds the urethra, so if it becomes enlarged, it will block the flow. The bladder wall is also thickened, making it difficult to empty urine. Patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia should see a doctor as soon as possible to better control the condition and improve nocturia.\n5. Effects of some drugs\nThe effects of some drugs can cause nocturnal polyuria, especially diuretics (blood pressure treatment, peripheral treatment of feet and ankles). Treatment medications that often cause nocturia include Furosemide, Demeclocycline, Methoxyflurane, Lithium, Propoxyphene, Phenytoin.",
