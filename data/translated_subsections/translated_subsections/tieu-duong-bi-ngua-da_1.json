    "subsection_content": "Diabetes causes itchy skin for many different reasons, often with localized itchy areas (3). Below are some reasons why people with diabetes have itchy skin more often than normal people:\n1. Kidney failure and cirrhosis\nPeople with diabetes experience complications such as kidney failure or cirrhosis, which can easily cause itchy skin, affecting their health and quality of life.\n2. Bacteria\nDiabetics have high blood sugar levels, which weakens the immune system, increasing the likelihood of skin infections if bacteria invade.\nCuts, blisters or cracks in the skin will allow bacteria to enter the body, causing the risk of skin infection, itching, and folliculitis.\nDepending on the skin condition, the doctor will prescribe topical or oral antibiotics to be applied to the itchy skin to kill bacteria and help the skin recover quickly.\n3. Fungal infection\nPeople with diabetes have a weak immune system, so they are susceptible to fungal infections, which cause itchy skin, often appearing between the toes. (4)\nAthlete's foot is caused by candida fungus, developing in the folds of the skin (folds in the elbows, feet, groin, neck, armpits...). Patients need to apply antifungal cream topically to kill fungi and prevent infection to improve skin condition.\n4. Drug allergy\nPeople with diabetes may have itchy skin as a side effect of some medications or have allergic reactions after use.\nWhen experiencing itchy skin due to drug allergy, the patient should see a doctor for timely treatment, change the appropriate prescription, and avoid damaging the skin.\nProducts such as perfumes, dyes, and soaps contain strong detergents that can dry out the skin, leading to itching.\nSome medications that treat other health problems commonly found in people with diabetes such as high blood pressure and high LDL cholesterol in the blood also cause itchy skin.\n5. Damage to blood vessels\nPeople with diabetes easily have itchy skin due to poor blood circulation. In these cases, itching is more likely to occur on the lower part of the legs.\nSometimes, itchy skin occurs because the nerve fibers in the outer layer of the skin are damaged. When high blood sugar damages nerve fibers, especially in the feet and hands, it will cause polyneuropathy or peripheral neuropathy, causing diabetics to have itchy skin.\nPeople with diabetes have high levels of cytokines (inflammatory substances) in the body, which also causes itchy skin and nerve damage, affecting health. When cytokine levels in the body increase, if patients with nerve damage are not treated early, it will lead to the development of neuropathy, causing itching that takes a long time to heal.\nTherefore, when there are symptoms of itchy skin, people with diabetes need to see a doctor specializing in Endocrinology - Diabetes and a specialist in Dermatology - skin aesthetics to check their health, receive timely treatment, and avoid health risks. Strong.\nPeople with diabetes should check their blood sugar regularly to better control blood sugar levels.",
