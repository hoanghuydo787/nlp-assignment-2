    "subsection_content": "Itching can be a symptom of diabetes or prediabetes (having high blood sugar levels approaching diabetic levels) (5). High blood sugar causes diabetes symptoms in a variety of ways, including:\n1. Dry skin\nWhen the amount of sugar (glucose) in the blood is too high. The patient's body will try to eliminate them by pushing fluid out of the cells to create more urine to release sugar through urine, making the skin dry and dehydrated, causing itching.\nHigh blood sugar damages the skin barrier (the outermost layer of the skin that protects the tissues under the skin), causing the skin to react to irritants by itching. If a person with diabetes scratches continuously, it will damage the skin and even lead to infection. High levels of glucose (sugar) in the blood also trigger an immune system response in the body that releases cytokines (inflammatory agents) that cause itchy skin.\n2. Poor circulation\nDiabetes affects the circulatory system in the body by damaging the lining of blood vessels, causing poor blood circulation and ineffective transport of nutrients, leading to diabetic neuropathy and nerve damage.\nIn particular, diabetic feet are most vulnerable due to reduced circulation. Diabetic neuropathy often causes itching in the lower legs, so patients need to clean their feet regularly, take care of healthy feet, and avoid scratching the skin, causing infection and health risks.\n3. Fungal infection\nDiabetics have weak resistance, so they are more susceptible to fungal infections. High glucose levels in the blood and urine will lead to overgrowth of yeast in the vagina. Vaginal yeast infection can cause very uncomfortable itching, affecting the patient's health and quality of life.",
