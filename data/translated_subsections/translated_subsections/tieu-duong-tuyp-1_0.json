    "subsection_content": "Type 1 diabetes (also known as type 1 diabetes) is a pathological condition that occurs when the pancreas cannot produce or produces very little insulin, leading to serious endogenous insulin deficiency. Insulin is a hormone that helps bring glucose in the blood into cells in the body to create energy for cell activity. Without insulin, glucose in the blood cannot enter the cells and gradually accumulates in the blood, leading to increased blood sugar, while the cells are \"energy hungry\" because they cannot receive glucose. Prolonged high blood sugar levels will harm the body and cause many symptoms and complications of diabetes. Therefore, type 1 diabetes was once called insulin-dependent diabetes. The disease is often diagnosed in children or young people, so it is also called juvenile diabetes, but the disease can also begin at any age. (first)\nType 1 diabetes is less common than type 2. Statistics show that type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5-10% of people with diabetes.",
