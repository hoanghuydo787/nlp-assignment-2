    "subsection_content": "Type 1 diabetes accounts for 10% of the total number of people with diabetes. The cause of type 1 diabetes is the destruction of beta cells in the pancreas, leaving the body with no or very little insulin. This leads to the patient's blood sugar not being converted into energy.\nOf the causes of type 1 diabetes, 95% of cases are due to autoimmune mechanisms (also known as type 1A) and 5% have unknown causes (also known as type 1B). In type 1A, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys cells responsible for producing insulin in the pancreas. Patients must depend on external sources of insulin.\nAlthough the risk factors for type 1 diabetes are still being researched, based on the number of cases, scientists note the general situation: when a family member has someone with type 1 diabetes. 1, the remaining members are also at risk of getting the disease, or the patient is exposed to certain viruses... leading to the destruction of the immune system, which is also a risk factor for disease.",
