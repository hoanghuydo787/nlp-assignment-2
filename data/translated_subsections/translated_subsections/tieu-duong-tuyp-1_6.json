    "subsection_content": "Over time, uncontrolled type 1 diabetes can cause complications in major organs in the body, including the heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. Maintaining normal blood sugar levels can reduce the risk of many complications.\nComplications of diabetes can lead to disability or even be life-threatening.\n1. Heart and blood vessel disease\nDiabetes increases the risk of certain heart and blood vessel problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke, narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis). and hypertension.\n2. Neuropathy (nerve damage)\nHigh levels of sugar in the blood over a long period of time can damage the walls of blood vessels (usually capillaries) that feed the nerves. This is especially common in the legs with tingling, numbness, burning or pain. Symptoms often start at the tips of the toes or fingers and spread upward. Poorly controlled blood sugar can cause patients to gradually lose feeling in their limbs and gradually increase the effects over time.\nDamage to the nerves that affect the digestive system can cause problems such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. In men, it can lead to erectile dysfunction.\n3. Diabetic kidney disease\nDiabetes can damage the small blood vessels in the kidneys. Severe cases can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease. At this time, the patient needs treatment with dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n4. Eye damage\nType 1 diabetes can damage the blood vessels in the retina, or diabetic retinopathy, which can lead to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision-affecting conditions such as cataracts and glaucoma.\n5. Diabetic feet\nDamage to the nerves in the feet or reduced blood flow to the feet due to narrowed blood vessels increases the risk of certain foot complications. If not treated properly, cuts and blisters can become severely infected, even leading to amputation of a toe, foot or leg (amputation).\n6. Skin and mouth infections\nPeople with diabetes may be more susceptible to skin and mouth infections than people without the disease. Infection occurs due to bacterial and fungal infections. Gum disease and dry mouth may also occur.\n7. Complications during pregnancy\nHigh blood sugar can be dangerous for both mother and baby. The risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and birth defects increases when blood sugar is not well controlled. For pregnant women, diabetes increases the risk of ketoacidosis, eye problems caused by diabetes (retinopathy) are often worse during pregnancy, high blood pressure due to pregnancy and preeclampsia.",
