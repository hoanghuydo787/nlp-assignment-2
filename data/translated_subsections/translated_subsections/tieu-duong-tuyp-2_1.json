    "subsection_content": "The pancreas is responsible for creating the hormone insulin. Insulin helps cells convert carbohydrates (glucose) from foods eaten daily into energy.\nHowever, in people with type 2 diabetes, although the body produces insulin, the cells do not use it or do not use it effectively. To avoid sugar remaining in the blood, the pancreas creates more insulin to release the \"stored\" glucose into cells. At some point, when the pancreas can no longer produce a steady amount of insulin, glucose that cannot be used for energy will accumulate in the blood and cause disease. (first)\nBelow are the factors that promote and combine to create the cause of type 2 diabetes:\nGenes: scientists have found different segments of DNA that influence how the body makes insulin.; Overweight/obesity: considered a cause of type 2 diabetes due to insulin resistance. However, not everyone who is overweight has type 2 diabetes. Overweight and obese people are about 6 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than normal people.; Metabolic syndrome: people with insulin resistance often face a group of symptoms including high blood sugar, excess fat around the waist, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and triglycerides.; The liver loses its balance in \"coordinating\" glucose. Insulin itself has the role of transporting glucose into cells to create energy to feed the body or storing it in the liver as glycogen when the body has excess glucose. However, in some cases, the liver has impaired function in balancing glucose metabolism, leading to insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and diabetes.; Cells do not use insulin effectively, so glucose cannot reach the body. This can cause a chain reaction, leading to type 2 diabetes.; Beta cells gradually decline in function over time. Therefore, pancreatic beta cells do not secrete enough insulin to compensate for insulin resistance.",
