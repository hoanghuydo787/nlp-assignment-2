    "subsection_content": "Treatment for type 2 diabetes involves a combination of lifestyle changes and medication.\n1. Change living habits\nDiet and exercise can help achieve target blood sugar levels:\nLosing weight. Losing an additional 5% - 7% of body weight or maintaining current weight helps reduce and stabilize blood sugar levels. In addition, portion control and healthy foods are also ways to improve health.; Healthy eating. There is no specific diet for people with type 2 diabetes. So, create a meal plan that focuses on the following factors:  Eat fewer calories Cut back on refined carbs, especially sweets Add vegetables and fruit into your diet  Get more fiber; Eat fewer calories; Cut back on refined carbs, especially sweets; Add vegetables and fruits to your diet; Intake more fiber; Do exercise. Maintain physical activity for 30 - 60 minutes a day through activities such as walking, cycling, swimming or other movements that help increase your heart rate. Combine with strength training exercises, like yoga or weightlifting. Note, if you take medication to reduce blood sugar, you need to eat lightly before exercising.; Monitor your blood sugar at home. Depending on the treatment method, especially if the patient is using insulin, the doctor will provide a plan for checking blood sugar levels and how often to test blood sugar at home.\n2. Combine the use of medication\nIf lifestyle changes do not help people with type 2 diabetes reach their target blood sugar levels, they may need medication. Some of the most popular medications for type 2 diabetes include:\nMetformin reduces the amount of glucose produced by the liver and helps the body respond better to insulin.; Sulfonylureas (glimepiride, glipizide and glyburide) group of drugs help the body make more insulin.; Meglitinides help the body make more insulin and work faster than sulfonylureas.; Thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone) help improve insulin response, but rosiglitazone increased the risk of heart problems so it was discontinued. Therefore, this group of drugs is not the first choice for treatment.; DPP-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, saxagliptin, vildagliptin and linagliptin) help reduce blood sugar levels, but still have some side effects but are insignificant compared to the benefits.; GLP-1 receptor agonists (albiglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide…)  slow digestion and reduce blood sugar levels.; SGLT2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin...) help the kidneys filter out more glucose. Empagliflozin (Jardiance) has also proven effective in reducing the risk of hospitalization or death from heart failure.; Insulin.\nIf the combination therapy still doesn't work or only works for a short time, your doctor may consider adding a third noninsulin drug or may start you on insulin therapy.",
