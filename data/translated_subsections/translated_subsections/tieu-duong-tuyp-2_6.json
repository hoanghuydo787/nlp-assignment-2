Acute complications\nHypoglycemia: Occurs when blood sugar level drops to 3.6mmol/l with symptoms of extreme hunger, fatigue, weak limbs, sweating, dizziness, and palpitations. If not treated promptly, you may fall into a coma and face the risk of death.; Increased osmotic pressure due to hyperglycemia. This is the most severe complication of type 2 diabetes and has a high risk of death. Therefore, when  encountering this complication, the patient needs immediate emergency treatment.; Ketoacidosis: A consequence of incomplete metabolism caused by lack of insulin. This is a toxic condition caused by acidification of the blood due to increased acid levels. Risk of death if not treated promptly.\n2. Chronic complications\nHeart and blood vessels: patients are 5 times more likely to have heart disease or stroke; Kidneys: if the kidneys fail, people with type 2 diabetes may need dialysis or a kidney transplant.; Eye complications: high blood sugar can damage the small blood vessels in the back of the eye (retinopathy). If not treated promptly, complications of vision loss may occur.; Affected nerves can cause diabetic foot complications and sexual disorders.; Skin damage takes a long time to heal. Poor blood circulation will cause wounds to heal longer and may become infected.; Affects sleep, especially drowsiness due to sleep disorders; Hearing problems. Patients may have hearing problems but the cause is unknown; Depression. People with type 2 diabetes are twice as likely to have depression as those without the disease.\nTo prevent these complications from occurring, patients need to manage type 2 diabetes well:\nTake your diabetes medication or insulin on time.; Check blood sugar levels.; Eat properly and don't skip meals; Regular check-ups to detect complications early (if any).",
