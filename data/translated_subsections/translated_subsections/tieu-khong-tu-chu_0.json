    "subsection_content": "Urinary incontinence is a condition in which urine leaks uncontrollably when coughing, sneezing or the feeling of needing to urinate occurs suddenly and continuously to the point of not being able to react in time. This problem makes the patient feel very uncomfortable, significantly affecting daily activities.\nSpecifically, the urinary system is composed of kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. The parts will coordinate to perform the task of filtering, containing and removing waste from the body. Initially, urine moves down the ureters and is stored in the bladder. When it is full, the brain will immediately send a signal to urinate. At this time, the sphincter opens, waste leaves the bladder and flows freely out of the body through the urethra.\nThis is the normal process when the urinary system operates smoothly, allowing psychological preparation before urinating. On the contrary, urinary incontinence occurs when these organs malfunction due to a number of different reasons.\nMany myths still believe that this is a natural part of the aging process and cannot be avoided. In fact, urinary incontinence tends to increase with age, but there are effective treatments to improve the condition.",
