    "subsection_content": "Urinary incontinence is classified into the following main groups: (1)\n1. Urinary incontinence\nThis group is characterized by signs of needing to urinate immediately, which occur suddenly and intensely, leaving the patient unable to react in time, leading to urinary incontinence. Urgent urination can result from an overactive bladder. Accordingly, the core causes are often due to nerve damage, infection, low estrogen levels after menopause, being overweight, weak pelvic muscles, consuming caffeine and alcohol...\n2. Stress urinary incontinence\nThis is a condition where you leak urine when you cough, sneeze, laugh, run, jump or lift objects. The main cause is weak pelvic floor muscles, which no longer effectively support other organs in the pelvic area as usual. At this time, some body activities can also put pressure on the bladder, leading to urine leakage. This is often a common problem for postpartum women or men who have undergone prostate surgery.\n3. Urinary incontinence due to overflow\nThis condition occurs when urine is not completely discharged from the bladder after each bowel movement, and instead leaks urine more frequently over time. This is a common problem in people with chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, diabetes, stroke... or men with large prostate size.\n4. Mixed urinary incontinence\nThis type of urinary incontinence is a combination of many different problems that lead to urinary leakage. To improve symptoms, patients need to contact a doctor to determine the exact cause, thereby finding effective solutions.",
