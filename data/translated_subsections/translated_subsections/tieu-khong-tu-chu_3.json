Temporary urinary incontinence\nCertain foods, drinks, and medications have the potential to stimulate the bladder and increase urine production, including:\nWine.; Caffeine.; Gas drink.; Artificial sweeteners.; Chocolate.; Chilli.; Foods containing a lot of spices, sugar, acids, especially citrus fruits; Medicines: drugs related to the heart, blood pressure, sedatives, muscle relaxants.; The body consumes too much Vitamin C.\nIn addition, temporary urinary incontinence can also stem from a number of diseases such as:\nConstipation: The rectum is located near the bladder and connected by many nerves. When constipated, hard stools will compress tightly in the rectum, causing pressure on the nerves, increasing the frequency of urination.; Urinary tract infection: Infection can irritate the bladder, causing an increased need to urinate and incontinence.\n2. Continuous and frequent urinary incontinence\nContinuous and persistent urinary incontinence can be directly related to physical changes, including:\nPregnancy: During pregnancy, hormonal changes as well as fetal development can lead to urinary incontinence; Normal birth: Vaginal birth causes weakening of some muscles and nerves related to the bladder, causing the pelvic floor to drop. At this time, the bladder, rectum, uterus or small intestine may be pushed out of normal position, increasing the risk of urinary incontinence.; Age: Over time, aging of the bladder muscle can reduce its ability to store urine. In addition, contractions also occur more frequently in old age.; Menopause: Entering menopause, women's bodies produce less estrogen than usual (this is a hormone that helps maintain the health of the bladder and urethra). This decline can make urinary incontinence worse.; Prostate enlargement: In older men, urinary incontinence often comes from prostate enlargement; Prostate cancer: Prostate cancer in men, if left untreated, can also become the cause of urinary incontinence.; Obstruction: A tumor anywhere along the urinary tract can block the normal flow of urine, leading to incontinence. In addition, urinary stones also cause similar effects.; Autonomic nervous system disorders: Multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke, brain tumor or spinal injury can interfere with nerve signals involved in bladder control, leading to urinary incontinence.",
