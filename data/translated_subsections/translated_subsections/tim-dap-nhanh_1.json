Tachyarrhythmias are often classified based on the place of origin of the arrhythmia. (2)\n1. Sinus tachycardia\nThe sinus node is the \"conductor\" of the heart, from here it emits electrical signals that spread to other parts of the heart, helping to keep the heart rhythm regular and change it depending on the body's needs. Sinus tachycardia occurs when the sinus node is overactive even at rest.\nThis could be due to stress, or be a sign of some other medical condition such as anemia, thyroid problems, infection or general poor health. Sometimes disorders of the sinus node itself are also the cause of sinus tachycardia.\n2. Supraventricular tachycardia\nTypes of tachyarrhythmias originating from the supraventricular region are often referred to as supraventricular tachycardia. Supraventricular tachycardia appears to be less life-threatening than ventricular tachycardia, but if the heart rate is too fast it can cause the heart to contract ineffectively, reducing blood flow to organs, causing low blood pressure and heart failure. Long term can lead to heart failure.\nTwo notable types of supraventricular tachycardia are atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation, which can produce blood clots leading to stroke if not detected and treated promptly.\n3. Ventricular tachycardia\nThe ventricles are where blood is directly pumped from the heart to other parts of the body. Tachycardia originating from the ventricles often seriously reduces the heart's ability to contract, causing hypotension, fainting and even death if the arrhythmia persists without timely treatment.",
