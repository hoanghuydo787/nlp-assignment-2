Heart palpitations associated with increased sympathetic nervous system activity, such as exercise, stress, pain or anxiety, are often the body's natural physiological response. Pathological causes of heart palpitations can be cardiac or non-cardiac.

Because the ventricles are the places that directly pump blood from the heart to other organs, ventricular tachycardia causes more severe symptoms, can cause fainting or even lead to death;; Ventricular fibrillation: This is the most dangerous form of tachyarrhythmia, often leading to death if not treated promptly;; Heart failure;; Acute coronary syndrome;; Myocarditis;; Cardiac tamponade.\nOther causes\nRespiratory: Pulmonary embolism or conditions causing respiratory failure, hypoxemia;; Infectious diseases;; Hyperthyroidism;; Acute or chronic anemia;; Poisoning by some drugs and toxins;; Hypoglycemia; dehydration; electrolyte disorders.\nRisk factors for tachycardia\nSmoking, using tobacco products;; Have a family history of tachycardia;; Physical and psychological stress;; Hypertension;; Overweight/Obes;; Drink lots of caffeine or alcohol;; Suffering from cardiovascular diseases.\nLet's see how regular smoking affects heart health",
