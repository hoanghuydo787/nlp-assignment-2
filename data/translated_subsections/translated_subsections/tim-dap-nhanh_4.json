    "subsection_content": "1. Examination\nThe doctor will examine and ask about symptoms, habits and medical history to assess whether the patient is at risk of rapid heart rate or not.\n2. Paraclinical diagnosis\nLaboratory tests are performed to confirm an abnormally fast heart rate and to look for conditions that may cause arrhythmia. Tests to diagnose tachycardia include:\n3. Electrocardiogram (ECG)\nMeasures and records images of the heart's electrical activity, allowing doctors to detect abnormalities.\n4. Holter ECG\nUsed to continuously monitor the patient's ECG at home. Depending on the assessment, the doctor may prescribe wearing it for 24 hours or more days to record the heart's electrical activity during daily activities and record seizures. Arrhythmias appeared during the follow-up period.\n5. Echocardiography\nUses ultrasound waves to create images of the heart to evaluate heart function, heart valves, and heart muscle abnormalities.\n6. Chest X-ray\nThis technique aims to detect abnormalities in the heart, lungs and pleura.\n7. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nProvides detailed images of the heart chambers and myocardium for in-depth assessment of myocardial diseases and myocardial scarring.\n8. Computed tomography (CT)\nProvides detailed images of the heart, lungs and blood vessels of the surveyed area. Depending on the medical condition, doctors can choose between computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, or combine both for diagnosis and treatment.\n9. Coronary angiography\nInstruments are inserted into the blood vessels that feed the heart to examine and intervene in clogged or narrowed blood vessels in the heart, using contrast dye and special X-rays to show inside the coronary arteries. A coronary angiogram may be performed to find the cause of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.\n10. Electrophysiological (EP) investigation\nInsert electrodes into the heart chambers to confirm the diagnosis of tachycardia and locate the arrhythmia within the heart. Electrophysiological testing is often performed in conjunction with arrhythmia ablation if indicated.\n11. Tilt table test\nOften used to evaluate patients with symptoms of syncope. During the test, the patient's heart rate and blood pressure will be continuously monitored. Under the doctor's careful supervision, the table is tilted to a position similar to a standing position, and a medication is used to assess fainting as well as changes in heart rate and blood pressure if fainting occurs. go out.\n12. Stress test\nSome types of tachycardia can be triggered by exertion. During a stress test, the doctor will continuously monitor the electrocardiogram as the patient exerts himself by riding a bicycle or walking on a treadmill. Stress testing is also used to evaluate coronary artery stenosis.\nBicycle dynamometer stress echocardiography is one of the methods to evaluate tachycardia.",
