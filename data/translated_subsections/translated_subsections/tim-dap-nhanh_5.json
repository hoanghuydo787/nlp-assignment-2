    "subsection_content": "According to MSc.BS.CKI Vu Xuan Quang, some types of tachycardia are very dangerous, especially ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation can be fatal if not treated immediately. Conversely, some tachycardias are mild or cause moderately dangerous problems.\nIf the person has sinus tachycardia due to stress, the symptoms will disappear when the fear, anxiety, or agitation stops. For most other types of tachycardia, the person will need medication or a procedure to prevent symptoms from returning.\nAlthough medications cannot cure tachycardia, they can help correct tachycardia. Besides, arrhythmia ablation intervention is a long-term solution for many types of tachyarrhythmias.",
