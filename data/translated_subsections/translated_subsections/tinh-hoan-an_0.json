    "subsection_content": "Undescended testicles are a condition in which a child is born in which one or both testicles do not descend into the scrotum or are located in a location other than the scrotum. During the fetal period, the fetus's two testicles are located behind the kidneys. When the fetus is about 8 weeks old, the two testicles have moved from the abdomen through the groin, down to the scrotum before the baby is born. About 10% of boys have hidden conditions in both testicles.(1)\nIn boys at birth, the incidence is about 3 - 4%. This rate increases when the newborn is underweight, has twins, or is born prematurely. Many cases of undescended testicles after birth will continue to move to the scrotum before the child is 3 months old. However, when a child is 6 months old, if the testicles are still not in the scrotum, it will be difficult for the testicles to move down on their own and requires appropriate treatment.\nThe disease is often detected in children with hormonal disorders, birth defects or genetic abnormalities. In some cases, children are born with undescended testicles but the cause cannot be determined.\nUndescended testicles are usually smaller than normal and the parenchyma is soft. According to research conducted in the US by Anne Suskind and colleagues, boys with hidden testicles often have smaller diameters of seminiferous tubules and higher levels of testicular fibrosis. This histological change has the potential to affect sperm, causing male infertility. When only one testicle is undescended, the patient can still have children. However, patients may face many health risks due to the risk of testicular cancer and a number of other risks.\nIf a man has undescended testicles on both sides, the risk of infertility will be very high. Their semen test results often show no sperm. Some patients cannot even have sex due to severe hormone deficiency. Men with undescended testicles often combine with other birth defects.\nIf not treated promptly and properly, people with undescended testicles are likely to face health risks such as testicular cancer, testicular torsion, testicular trauma or psychological and physiological damage because of lack of treatment. having or having only one testicle under the scrotum. There are two types of undescended testicles, specifically:\nPalpable form: When touching, the testicles can be felt at the inguinal canal, testicular springs.; Non-palpable form: Testicles are located in the deep inguinal ring, in the abdominal cavity. When touched, the testicles will not be felt.",
