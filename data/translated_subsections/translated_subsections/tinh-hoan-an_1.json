    "subsection_content": "Common causes of undescended testicles are:\nDisorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis: Hypopituitarism causes gonadotropin deficiency, causing undescended testicles and micropenis; Abnormal testosterone synthesis due to lack of enzymes 17α-hydroxylase, 5α-reductase... This causes the testicles to not develop normally.; Syndrome of reduced sensing ability of androgen receptors: Because of reduced sensing ability of androgen receptors, even if the baby is a boy, the development of male sexual function will be affected, including movement of the testicles.; Estrogen affects the movement of the testicles to the scrotum: Pregnant women carrying male fetuses if they use a lot of diethylstilbestrol or anti-androgen drugs, the fetus is at high risk of disease.; Abnormalities in the development of the testicular-scrotal ligament: This condition causes the testicles to lie suspended in the path of movement, not reaching the scrotum.; Mechanical factors that hinder the movement of the testicles such as short testicular peduncles, fibrosis of the inguinal canal...",
