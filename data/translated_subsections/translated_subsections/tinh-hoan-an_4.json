    "subsection_content": "The normal temperature in the scrotum is lower than that of the body. When hidden in the abdomen, the testicles are exposed to high temperatures, making it very difficult to develop and reduce the number of germ cells in sperm. (3)\nIf a boy has a unilateral undescended testicle, located in the inguinal canal, he may have a normal sperm count. Meanwhile, boys have both undescended testicles in the inguinal canal, which can cause infertility. If patients do not have surgery after the age of 5, the infertility rate is up to 75%. If this condition is not detected and treated early, complications such as:\nTesticular torsion: Because it is not well fixed in the scrotum, the testicles  can become twisted. This is a common case. The patient has symptoms of sudden swelling and pain in the groin area on the undescended testicle. The skin in the scrotum becomes dark red or pale and loses wrinkles. Without emergency examination and surgery within 3 hours, the testicles are at very high risk of necrosis.; Malignant tumor: When an undescended testicle in the abdomen is discovered late, it can develop into a malignant tumor.; Testicular trauma: When not within the scrotal skin, the testicles can potentially be damaged by pressure from the pubic bone.; Inguinal hernia: When the testicles are located in the groin, it can create a gap between the abdomen and the inguinal canal. The larger this gap, the more likely it is to push part of the intestine into the groin. (4)",
