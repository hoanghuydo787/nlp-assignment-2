    "subsection_content": "Undescended testicles are a condition in which one or both testicles do not move down into the scrotum while the fetus is developing. Usually only one testicle is undescended. In about 10% of cases, both testicles are affected. (first)\nAccording to fetal development, when the reproductive system is formed, the two testicles will initially be located in the abdomen. When nearly full term and preparing to give birth, the two new testicles gradually move down to the scrotum through a separate connecting tube. Therefore, a boy's testicles at birth and during the first 6 months of life can move on their own and then lie stably in the scrotum. Beyond 6 months of age, the rate of testicles moving back to the scrotum if not treated is very low. .",
