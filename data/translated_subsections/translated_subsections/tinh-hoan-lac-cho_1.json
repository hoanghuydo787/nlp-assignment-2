If the doctor cannot feel the testicle when palpating it, the testicle is likely located in locations such as:\nInguinal: At that time, the testicles have entered the inguinal canal to descend into the scrotum but are not far enough to be felt when touched; Abdomen: The testicles may not have moved yet or have just begun to move into the scrotum.; Absent or atrophied testicles: Although the testicles have descended into the scrotum, because of their very small size, they cannot be felt when touched. In this case, the boy may not be able to reproduce. In addition, in some cases there are no testicles, testicles have not been and will never be formed.",
