    "subsection_content": "Because the temperature in the abdomen is higher than the temperature in the scrotum, most sperm will not be able to survive the high temperature in the abdomen. Sperm in the abdomen will lose quality, die and cannot be produced anymore. In addition, testicles that stay in the abdomen for a long time are more likely to lead to cancer. Therefore, the patient should have surgery to bring the testicles down to the scrotum as soon as possible to save the ability to have children. Some complications related to the location of the undescended testicle include:\nTesticular torsion: Testicular torsion is the twisting of the spermatic cord, which includes blood vessels, nerves, and vas deferens. This condition causes pain for the patient because blood is blocked on its way to the testicles. If not treated early, this condition can lead to loss of testicles. Undescended testicles increase the risk of testicular torsion.; Trauma: When not within the skin of the scrotum, the testicles can potentially be damaged by pressure from the pubic bone; Inguinal hernia: When the testicles are located in the groin, it can create a gap between the abdomen and the inguinal canal. The larger this gap, the more likely it is to push part of the intestine into the groin.\nUndescended testicles can cause testicular torsion",
