    "subsection_content": "Newborns with undescended testicles will continue to be monitored. In the first 6 months of life, the testicles can move on their own and then lie stably in the scrotum. Beyond 6 months of age, the rate of testicles moving back to the scrotum if not treated is very low.\nThis late mobility situation does not cause any problems for the boys' health. However, parents also need to monitor their children to see if there are any other unusual symptoms.\nIf after 6 months, the baby's testicles still do not move to the right place, parents need to take the baby to the doctor for appropriate treatment. The temperature in the scrotum is adjusted by the body to suit the production and nourishment of sperm. Therefore, the testicles need to move to the scrotum, staying stable here for life.\nWhen the testicles are located in the abdomen, most of the sperm produced after puberty is complete will die due to the high temperature at this location. In addition, if it exists, sperm will also have reduced quality. When men reach reproductive age, this amount of sperm cannot help give birth.\nMale newborns with undescended testicles are still capable of maintaining reproductive function when detected and treated early. Because most of these cases persist into adolescence and adulthood, the testicles no longer function. This is also the reason why newly born boys are always checked for the presence of testicles in the scrotum.",
