    "subsection_content": "When undescended testicles are detected, the newborn will be monitored for the first 6 months of life. When the testicles do not move after 6 months, the doctor will conduct an examination and provide appropriate treatment. The goal of treatments is to return the testicles to the correct position in the scrotum. Early treatment will help minimize dangerous complications such as testicular cancer, infertility... (3)\n1. Medical treatment\nMale newborns will be treated by doctors through hCG injections. This is a type of placental hormone that stimulates the testicles to move down into the correct position in the scrotum. Injection dosage and injection time must be carefully considered by the doctor to suit each boy's physical condition.\nImproper injection dosage causes the testicles to not respond to the medication, leading to the child missing the golden time for treatment that would not have required surgical intervention. If delayed for a long time, the patient is at risk of testicular failure, calcification of the entire testicle, causing the testicles to be unable to perform endocrine and exocrine functions.\n2. Surgery\nSurgery to treat undescended testicles will be prescribed by the doctor when medical treatment has no results.\n2.1 Principles of undescended testicle surgery:\nTake the testicles out of the peritoneal tube (or abdomen) and ligate the peritoneal tube; Surgery, dissection and lengthening of the testicular pedicle in an attempt to lower the testicles into the scrotum; This is conservative surgery, so it requires experienced surgeons.\n2.2 Treatment direction:\nWhen the testicles do not move down into the scrotum on their own by the time a boy is 6 months old, the doctor will consider performing surgery about 1 year later.; For pre-pubescent boys with palpable undescended testicles, the doctor will perform surgery to lower the testicles into the scrotum or inguinal line.; In pre-pubescent boys with undescended undescended testicles, the doctor will perform an ultrasound examination to check the ability to palpate the testicles. If it is still not palpable, exploratory surgery will be performed. If testicles are detected, the doctor performs abdominal orchiectomy. At the time of testicular examination in boys whose testicles cannot be palpated, the doctor needs to determine the state of the testicular vessels to determine the next step of surgery.; For adult men, doctors need to perform surgery as soon as the testicles have not yet become cancerous. Surgery was then performed to lower the testicles and balance hormones. When the testicles have become cancerous, the doctor needs to remove the testicles, remove the lymph nodes in combination with supportive cancer treatment.; Some cases of undescended testicles require surgery to ensure future reproductive health for men.\nThe Center for Urology and Nephrology, Department of Andrology of Tam Anh General Hospital System brings together a team of leading experts in internal medicine and surgery, skilled and dedicated.\nPeople's Teacher Prof. Dr. Tran Quan Anh, Meritorious Physician Associate Prof. Dr. Vu Le Chuyen are giants in the field of Urology and Nephrology in Vietnam.
