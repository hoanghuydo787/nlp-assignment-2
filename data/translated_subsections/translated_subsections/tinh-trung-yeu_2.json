    "subsection_content": "The process of sperm production is relatively complex, requiring the stable operation of all related parts such as the testicles, hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Any problems that occur during this process have the potential to affect sperm production and health. The causes that affect sperm quality are:\n1. Pathological causes\nVaricocele: This is the most common cause of male infertility. The cause of this condition is still unknown. Varicocele reduces sperm quality.; Infection: Some infections can affect sperm production or create scars that block sperm transport (mechanical obstruction). Infectious cases such as epididymitis, orchitis and sexually transmitted diseases (gonorrhea, HIV...); Autoimmune disease: This cause is rare. This is a condition in which antibodies attack and destroy the body's sperm.; Tumor: Tumors have the ability to cause hormonal imbalance, affecting male reproductive organs. In addition, tumor treatment can also affect men's fertility.; Hormonal imbalance: Hormones are an indispensable component in the sperm production process. Therefore, hormonal imbalance can harm sperm production.; Using some medications: Some medications have the potential to harm sperm production, causing men's fertility to decline.; Some other causes: Birth defects, genetic disorders... can potentially affect men's fertility.\n2. Environmental causes\nIndustrial chemicals: Prolonged exposure to benzene, xylene, toluene, pesticides, herbicides, organic solvents, paint materials... can have negative effects on sperm.; Heavy metals: Exposure to lead and other heavy metals is one of the causes of male infertility; Radiation: Exposure to radiation has the ability to reduce or completely lose the ability to produce sperm. It can take men up to several years to recover.\n3. Lifestyle and other causes\nAlcohol abuse: Alcohol and alcoholic beverages both have the ability to reduce testosterone levels, affecting sperm.; Smoking: Smoking harms many aspects of health, including reproductive health.; Stress, depression: Prolonged stress can have a negative impact on sperm quality; Weight: Being overweight or obese can both directly impact sperm and cause hormonal imbalance, affecting the spermatogenesis process.",
