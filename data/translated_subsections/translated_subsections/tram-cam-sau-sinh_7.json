After giving birth, women's bodies will be weak and their routine will be disrupted. Let's ask for help from our husbands and relatives in taking care of a child together, giving priority to mothers having time to sleep and rest.\nNot too pressured to take care of children\nWhen raising a child for the first time, women are under a lot of pressure from conflicting views on child care, to the child breastfeeding less, the child gaining weight slowly, the child being born stunted, or the child being compared to other babies. Conflicts and comparisons unintentionally push mothers to feel pressured and doubt their own ability to care for their children. Instead of worrying, mothers need to be strong, gradually improve their child care skills, increase walking, eat properly, and talk to doctors if they have difficulty taking care of children. At the same time, increase communication with friends and family, and take advantage of reasonable sleep time to prevent depression.\nPostpartum depression is a common psychological disease in modern society that greatly affects the health of mother and baby. The disease needs to be detected early and treated promptly to support psychological stability, help the mother heal, and have enough health and good spirit to take care of her child. Relatives should take pregnant women for medical examination at reputable facilities to achieve the best results.",
