    "subsection_content": "Gastroesophageal reflux causes unpleasant symptoms inside the esophagus. If you are facing discomfort from heartburn, belching, belching, especially at night, then it is very likely that you have acid reflux.\nGastric reflux also causes nausea and can cause vomiting of food or gastric juice, usually if you eat too much or lie down immediately after eating.\nChest pain in the epigastrium is also more likely to originate from gastroesophageal reflux. Pain in the epigastrium or discomfort behind the sternum can be confused with symptoms of cardiovascular disease.\nWhen reflux becomes more severe and more frequent, it will cause edema and swelling of the esophageal mucosa. The patient may have difficulty swallowing, have difficulty swallowing, or feel like there is a lump in the throat.\nAnother common symptom in people with gastroesophageal reflux is sore throat, prolonged cough and hoarseness. This is because the throat and larynx are constantly exposed to stomach acid, leading to swelling, inflammation and coughing.\nIn addition to the symptoms mentioned above, due to acid residue from the esophagus, the mouth often secretes more saliva. In addition, during gastric reflux, bile can enter the stomach and then flow upward, creating a bitter feeling in the mouth. (2)\nGastroesophageal reflux causes heartburn and belching",
