    "subsection_content": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease can occur in anyone, from infants to adults, and doctors cannot always find a specific cause. However, there are several groups of people considered to be at high risk of developing the disease, including:\nPeople who are overweight or obese because it can put pressure on the abdomen. Pregnant women, especially in the last months of pregnancy, because the expanding uterus will compress some digestive organs, leading to reflux. People who must use certain medications, such as asthma medications, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines, sedatives, antidepressants, and pain relievers of the NSAIDs group. People who smoke or smoke tobacco. The impact of cigarette smoke entering the body through the esophagus will irritate the stomach lining. People with hiatal hernia, gastroparesis, or connective tissue diseases such as scleroderma. People with poor lifestyle and eating habits. Healthy people such as drinking alcohol, eating a lot of sour foods, eating a lot of oil, being lazy, lying down immediately after eating... are also subjects at high risk of gastric reflux.; People who are overweight or obese because it can put pressure on the abdomen; Pregnant women, especially in the last months of pregnancy, due to the expanding uterus, will compress some digestive organs, leading to reflux; People who must use certain medications, such as asthma medications, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines, sedatives, antidepressants, and NSAIDs; Smokers or passive smokers because cigarette smoke entering the body through the esophagus will irritate the stomach lining; People with hiatal hernia, gastroparesis, or connective tissue diseases such as scleroderma; People with unhealthy lifestyle and eating habits such as drinking alcohol, eating a lot of sour foods, eating a lot of oil, being lazy, lying down immediately after eating... are also at high risk of gastric reflux. .\nIn addition, stress due to pressure from work and life is also a common factor causing gastroesophageal reflux, especially in young people. Dr. Trung explained that stress will cause the body to increase the secretion of cortisol - causing increased acid in the stomach, increasing the force of stomach contractions, pushing gastric juice back up into the esophagus. Stress also disrupts esophageal motility, causing the esophageal sphincter to become sensitive, muscle relaxation occurs frequently and for a long time, causing gastric juice to reflux into the esophagus.\nFor newborns, some congenital factors can be the cause of wheezing, difficulty swallowing, vomiting and burping. Most symptoms will decrease or disappear completely as the child grows older, so there is no need for doctor intervention. For children who often experience this condition, you should take them to see a pediatrician for care instructions and medication if necessary.\nStress due to work pressure is also a cause of gastroesophageal reflux",
