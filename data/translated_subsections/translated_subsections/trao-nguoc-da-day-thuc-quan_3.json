According to Dr. Trung, prolonged gastric reflux can become the cause of dangerous digestive diseases such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers, esophageal stenosis, Barrett's esophagus and, more frighteningly, carcinoma. esophageal gland.(3)\nEsophagitis is a common complication seen in 50% of patients with gastric reflux. Diagnosed through gastroesophageal endoscopy, patients may have symptoms similar to gastric reflux such as: heartburn, regurgitation, choking, difficulty swallowing, increased salivation, chest pain, etc.; Esophagitis is a common complication seen in 50% of patients with gastric reflux.

Reflux is one of the main causes of esophageal stenosis. During reflux, acid from the stomach flows up into the esophagus, eroding the mucosal layer, leading to esophagitis. Prolonged and high-frequency reflux will cause irreversible damage to the esophagus, forming scar tissue that causes narrowing inside the esophagus. If not treated properly, esophageal stenosis will lead to many dangerous complications, specifically Barrett's esophagus; Esophageal stenosis has some symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty swallowing, choking in the neck...
