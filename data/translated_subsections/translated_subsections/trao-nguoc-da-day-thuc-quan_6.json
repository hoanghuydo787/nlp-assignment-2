    "subsection_content": "1. Does gastric reflux cause bad breath?\nProlonged gastric reflux will cause an unpleasant odor in the patient's breath, Dr. Trung said. Half-digested food in the stomach combined with bile and gastric juices coming up in contact with the esophagus, nasopharynx and mouth will cause the patient to have bad breath. Bad breath may be considered an extraesophageal symptom in patients with reflux.\nMany patients experiencing bad breath feel surprised when the doctor diagnoses the cause as reflux and not from dental-related diseases. Treatment of bad breath caused by reflux is only effective when the patient can control his or her reflux condition.\n2. Which side should one lie on for esophageal reflux?\nScience has proven that there are a number of sleeping positions that can help people with gastric reflux improve discomfort, making it easier to sleep. Dr. Trung often advises people with reflux to sleep on their backs, or with their heads raised to help the stomach lie lower than the esophagus, limiting the possibility of stomach acid or food refluxing upward.\nIf the patient is not used to sleeping on their back, they can adopt a position of lying on their left side. When lying on the left side, the stomach and pancreas are kept in a natural position lower than the esophagus, helping to effectively prevent reflux. Lying on the left side also helps limit the reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus - the cause of heartburn at night.\nThe hospital is also invested in the world's leading modern equipment and machinery, ensuring the best medical examination and treatment. For endoscopy, the hospital owns an NBI narrow-band dye endoscopy system, with a magnification of more than a hundred times, helping to clearly observe the microstructure of the mucosal surface, microvascular vessels in the mucosa, Avoid missing early cancer lesions, improve diagnosis and treatment efficiency.\nIn addition, Tam Anh General Hospital also provides inpatient rooms and high-end medical care services for patients in need of treatment at the hospital. Convenient services such as LED screen TV, Internet, equipment to connect medical staff to support 24/24... help patients feel completely secure and comfortable during treatment.\nTo schedule an examination and treatment for gastroesophageal reflux with experienced experts of Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact: Tam Anh General Hospital System: Hanoi: 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Bo De Ward, Long Bien District, Hanoi City Hotline: 024 3872 3872 - 024 7106 6858 HCMC: 2B Pho Quang, Ward 2, Tan Binh District, HCMC Hotline: 0287 102 6789 - 093 180 6858 Fanpage : Tam Anh General Hospital Website: https://tamanhhospital.vn\nIn short, gastroesophageal reflux disease can be treated.
