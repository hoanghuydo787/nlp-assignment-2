    "subsection_content": "The placenta is a very active organ that provides oxygen and nutrients to the fetus and it develops as the baby grows. Sometimes, for reasons that are not well understood, normal blood flow in the blood vessels of the placenta develops an abnormal pattern. When fetuses share a placenta, the result can be an imbalance in blood circulation, with one baby receiving too much blood through the umbilical cord and the other receiving too little. It is this imbalance that leads to twin-twin blood transfusion.\nThe disease occurs due to arterial-venous connection, leading to hemodynamic imbalance between the donor and recipient fetus. This syndrome is also known by the volume difference between the two amniotic chambers, polyhydramnios, and oligohydramnios. If not treated promptly, 90-100% of the fetus will die. If one of the fetuses dies, the remaining 25% will have severe neurological sequelae.\nThis is a serious progressive disorder. The twins are not malformed, but one transmits blood to the other through abnormal or unbalanced blood vessel connections in the shared placenta. More specifically, an artery branches from the twins' umbilical cord, entering the placenta to obtain oxygen and nutrients for the blood from the mother's circulation.\nNormally, the corresponding vein would return nutrient-rich blood to the same fetus, but unfortunately, it is directed to the other fetus through this abnormal “arterial-venous” connection. As a result, if there is no connection flowing in the opposite direction, one fetus receives too much blood and the other fetus becomes severely anemic.\nThe donor fetus suffers from reduced circulatory volume, which results in oliguria, oligohydramnios, and growth retardation. Manifestations of intrauterine growth retardation depend on the stage of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. The amount of amniotic fluid gradually decreases over time, causing the fetus to become tightly bound inside the amniotic membrane. Observation on ultrasound can see that the fetus is \"sticky\" to the uterine wall and does not move or change position.\nThe fetus receiving a lot of blood will show signs of polyuria, enlarged bladder, polyhydramnios, edema, and heart failure. The cause of these diseases is excessive increase in circulatory volume. Without treatment, most cases result in extremely premature birth. Even with treatment, the fetal mortality rate is 40% and the neonatal mortality rate is up to 60%.\n\"In the case of twin blood transfusions occurring before the 20th week of pregnancy, the risk of fetal death is almost 100% if not intervened promptly and with the correct technique,\" Ms. Dinh Thi Hien Le, MSc. said.\nMSc. Dinh Thi Hien Le and her colleagues at Tam Anh General Hospital have brought the opportunity to be born and live a healthy life for the fetus and the opportunity to become mothers for hundreds of pregnant women who unfortunately encounter dangerous complications.",
