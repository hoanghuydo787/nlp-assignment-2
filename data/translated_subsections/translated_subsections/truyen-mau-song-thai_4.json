    "subsection_content": "Diagnosis of the existence and stage of the disease is performed using ultrasound. The criteria for diagnosing monochorionic twins are the presence of twins of the same sex, thin amniotic membrane between the two fetuses and only one placenta. The syndrome is divided into 5 stages. Over time, if the twin transfusion progresses to a higher stage, the likelihood of fetal survival decreases. Scientists have estimated that 50% of cases will increase the stage, 30% will maintain the same stage and about 20% of cases will progress positively by reducing the stage.\nStage 1: Ultrasound shows amniotic fluid imbalance around the twins, with a small amount (<2cm) around the donor fetus and a large amount around the recipient fetus (>8cm). The fetuses have a difference of more than 20% in size.; Stage 2: The donor twin's bladder is not visible or not filled with urine on ultrasound. This finding indicates an empty bladder – a sign that the baby has stopped making urine.; Stage 3: Blood flow imbalance begins to affect heart function in one or both babies. This is seen in abnormal blood flow in the umbilical cord or heart of twins. Umbilical artery has absent end-diastolic wave or reversed end-diastolic wave (donor fetus). Duct venosus: has reversed waves (in the recipient fetus). The umbilical vein has a pulsatile waveform (in the recipient fetus).; Stage 4: Imbalance of blood flow causes signs of heart failure in one of the twins. In addition, 1 or 2 fetuses showed signs of fetal hydrops (in the fetus receiving blood and evidence of heart failure): edema in the scalp, ascites, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion; Stage 5: The disease gets worse, one or both twins will die.\nMaster and Doctor Dinh Thi Hien Le said that when the twin blood transfusion progressed to stage 5, the fetus died; Stage 4 is the most severe stage and the last stage where intervention is possible. Therefore, pregnant women carrying twins should be examined at reputable facilities to detect and intervene early on signs of the disease.",
