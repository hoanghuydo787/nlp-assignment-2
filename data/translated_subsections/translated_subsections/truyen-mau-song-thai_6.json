    "subsection_content": "Because this is a dangerous syndrome, it must be examined early and monitored regularly at a qualified obstetric facility. In particular, pregnant women with twins need to be closely monitored. If they see a rapidly enlarging abdomen, they must be checked immediately and treated promptly.\nMorphological ultrasound can provide pregnant women with most of the morphological abnormalities of the fetus.\nMothers carrying identical twins must be closely monitored from week 16 until birth with color Doppler ultrasound at least every 2 weeks. Because if detected before 20 weeks of age, the possibility of treatment will be higher. After 24 weeks, the possibility of intervention is very difficult and less successful. Blood transfusion to the fetus was determined when Doppler ultrasound showed that the diameter of the two amniotic sacs and the weight of the two fetuses were too large; One fetus did not visualize the bladder; There are abnormal waves in the arteries, umbilical veins, ductus venosus...",
