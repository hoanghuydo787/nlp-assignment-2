    "subsection_content": "According to research, many children born from pregnancies with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome show signs of nervous system damage. In addition, the rate of fetal nervous system damage during the prenatal period in cases with the disease is also higher than in cases of monozygotic twins without this syndrome.\nIn cases where only one fetus dies, 30% of surviving fetuses are at risk of brain damage, manifested by periventricular leukomalacia (periventricular white necrosis) that can be seen with MRI. or CT scan.; In the case where both fetuses are alive, the mechanism of brain damage may be increased vascular resistance due to blood vessels having too many red blood cells (fetal blood recipient) or anemia and hypoxia (fetal blood donor).\nTherefore, children with this condition need to have brain imaging tests within 48 hours of birth and closely monitor their subsequent neurological development. The long-term survival prognosis for children with twin transfusions depends on how early treatment is given after the condition develops, as well as the child's gestational age at birth. The earlier a newborn is treated and the longer he or she is in the womb before birth, the less likely he or she will have complications.\nWhen left untreated, 90% of infected children are at risk of dying after birth. That rate improved significantly for infants who underwent treatment with intrauterine laser laparoscopic surgery. This dangerous syndrome often causes premature birth, even when treated successfully. In this case, the newborn needs to be cared for in a neonatal intensive care unit.\nMost successfully treated babies live normal, healthy lives. However, some children experience mild symptoms, such as anemia, that are easily treated. A small number of children have more serious problems such as brain damage, neurological impairment and heart failure.\nIn the world, with the development of fetal medicine, many diseases and defects can be detected and treated right in the womb.
