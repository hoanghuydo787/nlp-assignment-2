    "subsection_content": "Tetralogy of Fallot or Fallot 4 (Tetralogy of Fallot – TOF – TET) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease. In a normal heart, oxygen-poor blood (black blood) from the body returns to the right atrium, down to the right ventricle, then the blood is pumped to the pulmonary artery, exchanging oxygen through the alveolar membrane - pulmonary capillaries. Oxygen-rich blood (red blood) from the lungs returns to the left atrium, down to the left ventricle and then is pumped out to the aorta to feed the body. (first)\nHowever, in tetralogy of Fallot, abnormal characteristics appear that reduce the amount of oxygen (black blood) pumped to the lungs. As a result, the patient has lower than normal levels of oxygen in the blood.\nIn Fallot 4, the heart has 4 anatomical abnormalities:\nVentricular septal defect: There is a hole between the right ventricle and the left ventricle.; Obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract: Narrowing of the junction between the right ventricle and the passage of blood to the pulmonary artery, leading to reduced blood flow to the lungs.; Overriding aorta: The aorta (main artery that pumps blood from the heart to the whole body) normally comes from the left heart, but in tetralogy of Fallot, it is deviated to the right compared to normal.; Right ventricular hypertrophy: The right ventricle is thickened due to having to pump blood from the ventricle at a higher pressure than normal.",
