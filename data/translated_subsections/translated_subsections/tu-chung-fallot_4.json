    "subsection_content": "Children with tetralogy of Fallot are at high risk of facing complications including:\nCyanosis due to lack of oxygen in infants; Cyanosis, hemoconcentration, thromboembolism.; Heart failure.; Infection, especially infective endocarditis; Even after treatment, there is still a risk of complications such as arrhythmia and pulmonary valve regurgitation.\nDoctor Minh Thuy recommends that parents need to pay attention to their children's purple spells. During bouts of cyanosis (usually appearing after meals, when the child takes a warm bath or is stressed), it can cause the child to suddenly lose blood oxygen. The baby is severely purple, breathes faster than normal and may become very irritable or fussy. In that case, oxygen levels can drop to a level that threatens the child's life, so parents need to take the child immediately to a medical facility for emergency medical care.",
