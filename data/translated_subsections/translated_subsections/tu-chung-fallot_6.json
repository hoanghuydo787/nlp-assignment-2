Based on the patient's medical condition and physical condition, the doctor will prescribe the most appropriate surgical regimen and time.\nThe surgical method for children with tetralogy of Fallot must be repair surgery. Surgery is usually performed in the first 3-6 months of life, in some cases it will be performed earlier or later if necessary.\nDuring the examination, the treating doctor will inform the parents about the baby's heart condition, determine whether it is suitable for complete surgery or take steps to treat this disease.\nComplete surgery includes closure of the ventricular septal defect (usually using a Dacron patch) and widening of the right ventricular-pulmonary artery connection).\nIn some cases, surgery must be performed twice depending on the overall condition and assessment of whether the heart structure is not suitable for complete repair. At that time, the child will be created a temporary aorta-lung bridge while waiting for the heart structure to be suitable for complete repair.\nCardiac catheterization technique will be applied to some children, especially older children and adolescents, who need cardiac catheterization to obtain more information when echocardiography is not diagnostic enough. In some emergency cases of severe cyanosis, interventional cardiac catheterization is performed in infancy and early childhood to widen the right ventricular connection to the pulmonary artery. This procedure is temporary to increase oxygen levels in the blood.\nIn addition, in the process of taking care of children with tetralogy of Fallot, children need to be examined and evaluated for nutritional status (iron supplementation to suit their physical condition), dental health, as well as need to use additional medication to prevent disease. Prevent hypoxic cyanosis. Some older children with symptomatic hemoconcentration will have their blood drained and their body's fluids replenished.\nIn some cases, the infection that has not had surgery for Fallot becomes more serious and needs to be monitored and treated in the hospital to ensure the child's safety.",
