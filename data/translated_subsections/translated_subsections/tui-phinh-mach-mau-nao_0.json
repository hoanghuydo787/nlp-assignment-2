    "subsection_content": "A cerebral aneurysm is a condition in which one or more blood vessels in the brain bulge, forming a \"sac\". The shape of the aneurysm resembles a berry. Experts believe that brain aneurysms form when blood flows through and puts pressure on a weak area of ​​the vessel wall, over time causing the vessel wall to dilate and form an enlarged aneurysm.\nBrain aneurysms can form anywhere in the patient's brain, most commonly in the major arteries along the base of the skull. Most small aneurysms will not cause any unusual symptoms, but when the aneurysm is large enough, it will cause related symptoms and put pressure on nearby nerves or brain tissue.\nThe aneurysm needs to be removed (if necessary) and when it accidentally ruptures, the patient needs to get medical attention as soon as possible because it can be life-threatening. Typically, a ruptured aneurysm occurs in the space between the brain and the thin tissues that cover the brain; causes bleeding inside the brain and is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Anyone can get a brain aneurysm, especially patients between the ages of 30 and 60.\nBrain aneurysms can form anywhere in the patient's brain",
