Among them, cerebral aneurysm or aortic aneurysm is the most common type of cerebral aneurysm, accounting for about 90% of all cases. Cerebral aneurysms often occur in arteries located in front of the brain, especially in the branching area of ​​the cerebral blood vessels at the base of the brain. (first)\nIn addition, dissecting aneurysms and fusiform aneurysms are also two common types of brain aneurysms. Specifically:\nFusiform aneurysms are considered to be the result of damage from severe atherosclerotic plaques in the brain; The location that usually appears is in the basilar circuit.; A dissecting aneurysm is a collection of blood inside the vessel wall and is often related to high blood pressure or brain injury.",
