However, when a brain aneurysm grows large enough, it will put pressure on nearby nerves or brain tissue, causing symptoms such as: (3)\nHeadache.; Vision changes.; Pupils widen (dilated).; Numbness or tingling in the head or face; Pain above and behind the eyes; Convulsion.\nWhen a brain aneurysm grows large enough, it will cause symptoms: headaches, convulsions, dilated pupils, etc.\nSymptoms of a cerebral aneurysm when it ruptures\nBefore rupture, aneurysms in the brain will leak some blood, called a focal hemorrhage. At this time, the patient may have a warning headache due to a small aneurysm leak for several days or weeks before the aneurysm actually ruptures. A ruptured aneurysm in the brain will cause many dangerous symptoms such as: (4)\nSevere headache (sudden onset, strong pain intensity can cause the patient to faint or coma).; Nausea and vomiting; Neck tense.; Blurry or double vision; Sensitivity to light (photophobia).; Convulsion.; The eyelids droop and the pupils dilate.; Pain above and behind the eyes; Cognitive disorders.; Weakness or paralysis of the whole body; Gradual loss of consciousness; Causes cerebral hemorrhagic stroke.",
