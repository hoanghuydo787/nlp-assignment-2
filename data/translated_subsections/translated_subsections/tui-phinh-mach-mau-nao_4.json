    "subsection_content": "A brain aneurysm has the potential to endanger the patient's health, especially when it ruptures, causing bleeding and pressure on surrounding brain tissue. A ruptured brain aneurysm can cause life-threatening problems such as:\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH): Bleeding in the area between the brain and the arachnoid layer in the brain. The possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to ruptured cerebral aneurysm is as high as 90%.; Hemorrhagic stroke: Bleeding in the space between the skull and brain.\nIf not treated promptly, subarachnoid hemorrhage and hemorrhagic stroke can lead to permanent brain damage or a number of dangerous complications such as:\nVasospasm: Occurs when blood vessels narrow, hindering the transport of oxygen to the brain.; Hydrocephalus: Occurs when there is a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid or blood buildup around the brain.; Convulsions: This is a sign that the brain cannot control its activities. Convulsions will cause brain damage to become more serious.; Coma: Is a state of unconsciousness lasting from a few days to a few weeks.; Death: Up to 50% of brain aneurysms lead to death.",
