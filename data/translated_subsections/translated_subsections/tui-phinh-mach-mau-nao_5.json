High blood pressure will cause blood to push against the blood vessel walls. Effects that can cause blood pressure in the body to increase, leading to the rupture of a brain aneurysm include:\nOften stressed and angry; High-intensity labor, sudden vigorous exercise; Hypertension is not treated promptly and properly.\nThe doctor will examine and rely on the following factors to determine the possibility of a brain aneurysm rupture:\nSize and shape: If the brain aneurysm has an irregular shape and large size, the risk of rupture increases; Growth rate: Through test results, the doctor will determine whether the brain aneurysm is growing or not, and whether the growth rate is fast or slow.; Location: Aneurysms in the posterior communicating arteries (a pair of arteries in the back of the brain) and anterior communicating arteries (an artery in the front of the brain) have a higher risk of rupture than aneurysms in other cerebral arteries. other position.; Race: Statistics show that the risk of aneurysm rupture may be higher in certain races.; Age: Patients over 70 years old have a higher risk of aneurysm rupture.",
