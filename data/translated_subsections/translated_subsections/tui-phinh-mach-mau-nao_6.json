Patients can go for regular screening, especially in cases of persistent headaches, decreased vision, etc. Imaging tests that can help diagnose and evaluate cerebral aneurysms include:\nCT scan (computed tomography): CT scan helps doctors examine the condition of blood leakage in the brain. This technique uses X-rays to create cross-sectional or detailed images of blood flow in the brain's arteries. This imaging technique will show the size, location and shape of the brain aneurysm.; MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): This technique uses radio waves to create detailed images of the brain arteries and can show the size, location and shape of the aneurysm.; Cerebral angiography with DSA machine: This is an endovascular intervention technique with the purpose of collecting images of cerebral arteries. This technique will help doctors detect blockages and identify weaknesses in the cerebral artery walls, including brain aneurysms.; Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis: The doctor will collect a cerebrospinal fluid sample using a lumbar puncture, prescribed by the doctor for the purpose of measuring the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord. A cerebrospinal fluid analysis procedure will help doctors detect bleeding problems around the brain.\nCheck to see if there is an aneurysm in the brain vessel with some diagnostic imaging tests: CT scan, MRI scan, cerebral angiogram, cerebrospinal fluid analysis",
