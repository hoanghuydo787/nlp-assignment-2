    "subsection_content": "Doctors need to determine the condition and prognosis of the brain aneurysm to provide appropriate treatment. If the brain aneurysm is small, has not ruptured, is in a non-dangerous location, does not cause symptoms, and the patient has no other associated risk factors, treatment is not required. Instead, patients need to have regular check-ups to monitor the condition of the brain aneurysm.\nIf the brain aneurysm is in a dangerous location or has grown to a larger size and is causing symptoms, the patient needs to consult a doctor for appropriate treatment. Treatment options for brain aneurysms depend on the following factors:\nAge and general health of the patient; Location and size of aneurysm.; Family medical history.\nMaintaining a healthy body and stable blood pressure will help limit brain aneurysm rupture\nHigh blood pressure is a favorable condition that promotes the rapid development of brain aneurysms, making them more susceptible to rupture. Therefore, patients need to maintain stable blood pressure by adjusting living habits, avoiding factors that cause high blood pressure, thereby limiting the rupture of brain aneurysms.",
