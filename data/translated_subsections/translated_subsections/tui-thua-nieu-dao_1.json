    "subsection_content": "Urethral Diverticulum (UD) is a bag or bulge of varying sizes that forms next to the urethra. Because the bulge is connected to the urethra, it is always filled with urine during urination. Urethral diverticulosis occurs much more frequently in women than in men and is estimated to occur in 1-6% of women.(1)\nUrethral diverticula often communicate with the urethral lumen and protrude outward and stretch the smooth muscle around the urethra. Sometimes, they extend proximally below the bladder neck and trigeminal region. On histological examination, urethral diverticula show marked inflammation of the transitional epithelial mucosa, which overlaps the thin circumferential diverticulum wall. This wall consists of fibromuscular tissue with or without an internal epithelial layer.",
