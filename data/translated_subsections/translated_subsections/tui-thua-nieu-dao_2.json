It has been suggested that the congenital condition is due to embryonic remnants and usually originates from Gartner duct cysts and Müllerian duct cysts.\nInflammation of the glands adjacent to the urethra, forming an abscess that eventually invades the urethra, is thought to be a common cause. In addition, some pelvic floor disorders during childbirth can also cause the formation of urethral diverticula in women. (2)",
