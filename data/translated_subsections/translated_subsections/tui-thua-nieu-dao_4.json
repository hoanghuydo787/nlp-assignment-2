    "subsection_content": "Currently, only about 50-60% of patients with urethral diverticula are diagnosed through clinical examination. Therefore, to accurately diagnose the disease, the following methods can be used: (3)\nPhysical examination: Usually in women, urethral diverticula are found during a routine gynecological examination or through exploring the symptoms they experience. At that time, the doctor will do a physical examination or order tests to try to find the cause. During a physical examination, the doctor will touch the vaginal wall to check for any tumors, as well as determine the location of pain. If diverticula are felt, the doctor may gently squeeze them to see if urine accumulates or pus drains. The doctor will usually also order a urinalysis for the patient at this time.; Urethoscopy: Endoscopy allows direct visualization of the urethra, thus accurately determining the location of the diverticulum neck. However, it is easy to miss especially collapsed diverticula or small diverticulum necks.; Vaginal cystourethrography (VCUG) or retrograde cystourethrography (UCR): This film shows the location, size and relationship of the diverticula with neighboring organs such as the urethra, bladder, vagina.; Ultrasound: Ultrasound is a simple, non-invasive diagnostic tool, has no risk of causing allergies or radiation effects, and is effective in diagnosing urethral diverticula. However, depending on the doctor's experience and ultrasound equipment, small diverticula may be missed, so women need to choose reputable medical facilities with highly experienced and specialized doctors. to examine.; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI has very high sensitivity in diagnosing ureteral diverticula, especially small diverticula, but has low specificity. MRI provides detailed results on the location, number, size, shape, complications and neck of diverticula as well as distinguishing lesions or urethral anatomical abnormalities.",
