The disease was first described by William Hey in 1786, as a sac that opens beyond the urethral wall into the virtual space between the urethra and vagina. The disease is often misdiagnosed or delayed because the condition is rare and the clinical manifestations are vague. Therefore, if you do not think about this pathology, diagnosing the disease is a challenge for doctors. Common complications in urethral diverticula are recurrent urinary tract infections, diverticulum stones, and malignancy.",
