The hemangioma will reach 80% of its maximum size when the infant is 3 months old. Normally, hemangiomas will stop growing (flatten and become less dark) and gradually shrink in size when the child is 1 year old. Over time, about half of childhood hemangiomas will leave scar tissue or form excess blood vessels on the skin. Statistics on hemangioma cases around the world have shown that hemangioma is more common in boys than girls and that white children are more susceptible to the disease than children of color.\nMost of the time, hemangiomas in children do not need to be treated because the tumor will gradually disappear over time. However, if your child has a hemangioma in a sensitive location, affecting the function of other organs in the body, you should consult a doctor for early treatment.\nHemangioma most commonly appears as a bright red birthmark on the skin of young children",
