Scientists have not been able to conclude why blood vessels cluster together, but they believe this may be due to certain related proteins produced in the placenta during pregnancy. baby still in the mother's womb). (2)\nHemangiomas on the skin can appear all over the body, but are most common in the head, neck, and face. Hemangiomas can form in the top layer of the skin or in the fatty layer below the skin. Initially, hemangioma may just be a red birthmark on the skin, but gradually, the tumor begins to protrude from the skin. In addition, hemangiomas formed from blood vessels deep under the skin are also known as cavernous hemangiomas and require a doctor's intervention to avoid dangerous complications such as seizures and impaired neurological function. ,…\nInitially, hemangioma may just be a red birthmark on the skin, but over time the tumor may protrude from the skin.\nHemangioma in the liver\nHemangiomas on the liver have the highest occurrence rate among the group of hemangiomas in organs inside the body. Accordingly, hemangioma will develop inside or on the surface of the liver. Some studies show that using birth control pills can lead to hemangioma in the baby's liver right in the womb.\nThe rate of healthy adults with hemangioma in the liver can range from 5% to 7%, with women 6 times more likely to have the disease than men. Usually hemangiomas in the liver are not malignant tumors, and there is no research showing that they can develop into cancer. The liver is an organ without sensory nerves, so it will be difficult to detect liver hemangioma in the early stages. Most patients will detect this disease when performing paraclinical tests such as liver ultrasound, computed tomography, etc.\nOther position\nNot only on the surface of the skin or in the liver, hemangioma can also appear in other organs inside the body such as: intestines, spine, respiratory organs, vulva, pharynx, etc. Depending on the location. Due to the location and size of the tumor, the patient may encounter some risks such as ulcers, bleeding, and tumor cracking during daily activities.",
