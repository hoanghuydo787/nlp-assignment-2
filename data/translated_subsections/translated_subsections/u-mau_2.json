    "subsection_content": "Currently, the specific cause of hemangioma has not been determined. Some medical research suggests that neonatal hemangioma is formed due to errors in the development of the vascular system during fetal development. Additionally, some cases of hemangioma are thought to be related to genetic abnormalities (eg, cavernous hemangioma in von Hippel-Lindau disease).\nThere is currently no scientific research proving that there is a connection between occupational factors and hemangioma. Therefore, whether a person is regularly exposed to chemicals or radiation creates a risk of hemangioma or not, there is still no exact answer.",
