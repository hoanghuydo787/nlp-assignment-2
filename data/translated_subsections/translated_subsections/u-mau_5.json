(3)\nRegardless of the type, hemangiomas will often share the same physiological characteristics and stages of development:\nProliferative phase: At this stage, superficial hemangioma will last for 3 - 6 months and deep hemangioma will last for 8 - 10 months.; Stable stage: This is the stage when the hemangioma gradually stabilizes in size and clinical signs. This stage of hemangioma will usually last 18 to 20 months.; Regression stage: When reaching this stage, the hemangioma will begin to gradually fade in color and then collapse. Most hemangiomas will regress after the child is 5 years old.",
