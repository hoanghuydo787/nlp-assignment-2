During the physical examination, the doctor will directly examine the tumor if it is a hemangioma on the skin. If the hemangioma is located in a special location or it is suspected that the hemangioma is located deep inside the skin or in internal organs, the patient will be asked to perform a number of laboratory tests including: (4)\nX-ray and computed tomography (CT): Both of these imaging tests can help detect calcified cavernous hemangiomas (called phleboliths).; MRI scan: This technique will produce clear images of soft structures including hemangioma. On an MRI scan, the hemangioma will appear as a \"bag of worms\" formed by blood vessels wrapped around each other; Differential diagnosis: These tests will help doctors distinguish hemangiomas from other types of vascular malformations and soft tissue tumors. This test is important in distinguishing common hemangiomas from malignant hemangiomas such as angiosarcoma.",
