    "subsection_content": "Non-surgical treatment of hemangioma\nNormally, hemangioma in children can go away on its own without needing treatment, but when a hemangioma is detected, the patient needs to consult a doctor. Some non-surgical hemangioma treatments include: (5)\nBeta blockers: This is a medication that may be recommended depending on the type and size of the hemangioma. For facial hemangiomas and infantile hemangiomas, beta blockers may be given orally (in pill form) with the goal of slowing tumor growth.; Anti-inflammatory medications: If the hemangioma is growing near vital structures, such as the nose, lips or eyelids, your doctor may recommend steroid medications. Steroids are commonly used to slow tumor growth, which can be injected directly into the hemangioma or taken orally.; Embolization: This is a minimally invasive procedure that is helpful in shrinking tumors and reducing pain. Normally the tumor will regenerate its blood supply over time after these procedures. Embolization is also sometimes used before surgery to reduce the risk of excessive blood loss.; Laser treatment: Laser treatment is usually reserved for cutaneous hemangiomas. For some people, lasers can be helpful in removing tumors or relieving pain and other unwanted symptoms.\nTreatment of hemangioma by surgery\nSurgical methods will often be applied to treat cavernous hemangioma (if the tumor is tending to destroy surrounding healthy tissue). In some cases, benign hemangiomas can still cause symptoms severe enough to consider surgical treatment.\nThe goal of treating hemangioma with surgery is to remove the tumor from the body. To perform this process, the patient will be anesthetized, and the surgeon will perform surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible. The most common complication of hemangioma removal surgery is hemorrhage (blood loss). Additionally, hemangiomas have a high tendency to recur after surgery, depending on the type and location of the tumor.\nWith hemangioma inside the body, modern techniques and machines such as laparoscopic surgery, positioning... will support effective surgery.\nTo find out exactly how a hemangioma should be treated, the patient needs to visit a medical facility or hospital to meet the doctor directly. At Tam Anh General Hospital System, you can schedule a hemangioma examination via:\nCall center 0287 102 6789 - 028 7300 6858 (HCMC) or 024 3872 3872 - 024 7106 6858 (Hanoi) to register for a private medical appointment with a specialist, through customer service staff.
