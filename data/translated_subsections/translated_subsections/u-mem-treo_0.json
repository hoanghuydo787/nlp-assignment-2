    "subsection_content": "Molluscum contagiosum, also known as skin tag or skin tag, is a benign growth of normal skin. The soft tumor has a smooth surface, often grows from a stalk or papilla, protrudes completely above the skin surface, and is black, yellow, brown or similar to the skin color. These soft lumps often form in areas where the skin is exposed to sunlight such as the face, neck, etc.; or areas of skin that rub together a lot such as the neck, armpits, under the breasts, eyelids, groin, and anus. (first)\nThese skin tags are usually 1-10mm in size, but in many cases the size is up to 3cm, or even larger. A person can have many hanging mollusks at the same time, possibly 3 - 4 or more than 10 skin tags. The disease often appears in people over 50 years old.\nAfter the examination, the doctor prescribed Mrs. H. to treat excess skin with liquid nitrogen and surgery without \"going under the knife\". After 2 weeks of follow-up examination, the soft lumps in the eyes and nose disappeared. Mrs. H. no longer feels itchy or uncomfortable, especially her steps are steadier because her vision is no longer limited.",
