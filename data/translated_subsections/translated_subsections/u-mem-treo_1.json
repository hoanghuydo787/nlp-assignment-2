    "subsection_content": "According to Dr. Bich, molluscum contagiosum occurs with two factors: subjective and objective: (2)\nSubjective factors are due to skin being exposed to the sun for too long, for long periods of time without appropriate sun protection measures. In women, the parts of the skin that are exposed to the sun a lot are the neck, chest, etc.; For men, the back, shoulders and many other areas due to the habit of going bare in the sun will have a higher risk of skin tags appearing. People who sunbathe, go to the beach, work outdoors too much such as fishing, street vendors... who do not use sun protection accessories are at high risk.\nThe objective factor comes from our country's tropical monsoon climate and bright sunlight for many hours a day. This is the main cause of skin aging in the elderly. Statistics show that about 80%-90% of Vietnamese people suffer from skin damage caused by sunlight. In addition, advanced age is also a factor causing skin aging. If young people suffer from this condition, it is called premature skin aging. The process of forming soft tumors takes about 3-4 years.",
