    "subsection_content": "Based on the structure and properties of each tumor, ovarian cysts must be divided into: functional cysts and organic cysts.\nFunctional cyst\nThis is a tumor caused by endocrine dysfunction of the ovaries. Pathologically, the ovarian organization remains unchanged. There are 3 types of functional cysts:\nOvarian cysts: These are ovarian follicles that are mature enough but do not rupture or ovulate. The follicles continue to grow and can grow up to 8cm, causing women to delay their menstrual cycle.; Corpus luteum cyst: Pictured because the corpus luteum still develops normally after ovulation, then creates cysts with thin shells filled with fluid inside, causing pain and bleeding in the pelvic area.; Yellow cyst: common in patients with molar pregnancy, trophoblastic cancer..\nOrganic cyst\nThese tumors have changes in ovarian organization, so there is a risk of cancer. Types of physical tumors:\nWater cyst: The most common form. A fluid-filled, thin-walled sac is usually benign. But if there are increased blood vessels on the surface or papillae on the surface or inside the tumor, these are signs of suspected cancer.; Dermoid cysts: The most common is teratoma, accounting for 25% of ovarian cysts, mostly benign, and can occur at all ages from pre-pubescent children, women of childbearing age and menopause. The cyst wall is structured like a horny layer, containing hair, bones, teeth, sebaceous glands, etc., which are easily twisted; Mucinous cyst: Accounts for 20% of ovarian tumors. This is a tumor with many lobes, so it is larger in size than other types of tumors. The cyst contains yellow, thick mucus that often sticks to surrounding organs; Ovarian endometriosis cyst: endometrial tissue grows right on the surface of the ovary, causing destruction of healthy ovarian tissue, the cyst has a thin shell, sticks to surrounding organizations, contains chocolate color inside, normal tumor Causes pain during menstruation, too much adhesion blocks the fallopian tubes, causing infertility.",
