    "subsection_content": "Normally, ovarian cysts on the left, right or both sides are benign and can disappear on their own, without causing harm to health or life. However, in some cases, cysts progress slowly and silently for many years, compressing internal organs can cause dangerous complications such as: (3)\nCyst torsion: This complication can occur in any tumor, especially small tumors with long, non-adhesive stems that are easily twisted. When the tumor is twisted, the patient has severe, continuous abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes dizziness from the pain. Examination revealed abdominal distention, hypogastric pain, and abdominal wall reaction. Vaginal examination revealed a swollen, painful tumor; Ovarian cyst rupture: When the fluid pressure inside the tumor is too great, it can cause the cyst to rupture. At this time, the patient may have sudden and continuous abdominal pain. In some cases, cyst rupture can cause bleeding in the abdomen, causing the patient to feel dizzy and faint. After the cyst ruptures, the patient may have an infection syndrome, a reaction in the peritoneum, and when the vagina is examined, the tumor will be sticky and painful to press. If not detected early and treated promptly, the patient's life can be life-threatening.; Visceral compression: This is a late complication that appears when the tumor has grown large over time. Tumors compress the bladder causing sharp pain when urinating, compress the rectum leading to constipation, compress the ureters causing hydronephrosis, and even compress the inferior vena cava leading to collateral circulation and edema. lower extremities, ascites.",
