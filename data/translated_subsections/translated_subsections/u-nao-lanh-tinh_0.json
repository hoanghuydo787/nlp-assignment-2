    "subsection_content": "A benign brain tumor is a collection of brain cells that proliferate faster than normal – enough to form a tumor – without rapidly invading healthy brain tissue or metastasizing to other organs. (2)\nCharacteristics: Benign brain tumors are not cancerous, they are usually 2-3cm in diameter, tend to stay in one place and grow slowly at a growth rate of 1-2mm a year. Very rarely, a benign tumor can become malignant.; Level of danger: Benign brain tumors still pose a danger. They can damage parts of the brain, causing dysfunction and serious deformities. Benign brain tumors located in critical areas of the brain can be life-threatening.; Prognosis of survival: According to the US National Brain Tumor Society, benign brain tumors have a very high survival rate after 5 years (from the time of diagnosis), up to 91.8%. This means that for every 100 people with a benign brain tumor, 92 will live 5 years or more after diagnosis.; Prevalence: Benign brain tumors account for 70-80% of the total number of primary brain tumors - brain tumors that originate directly from the brain without metastasizing from other parts of the body.; Subject: Benign brain tumors can appear in all ages and genders. However: The incidence of benign brain tumors is highest in people over 85 years of age and lowest in children and adolescents aged 0-19 years. Benign brain tumors occur significantly more frequently in women (64%) than in men (36%). The average age for brain tumor diagnosis is 61 years old.; The incidence of benign brain tumors is highest in people over 85 years of age and lowest in children and adolescents aged 0-19 years.; Benign brain tumors occur significantly more frequently in women (64%) than in men (36%).; The average age for brain tumor diagnosis is 61 years old.\nBenign brain tumors are usually small tumors, less invasive and have a slow growth rate, causing little danger to the patient's life.",
