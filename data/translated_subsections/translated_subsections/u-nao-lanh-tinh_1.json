    "subsection_content": "There are more than 130 different types of brain tumors that can develop in the brain. Among them, common known types of benign brain tumors include:\nMeningioma: Is the most common type of benign brain tumor, accounting for 54.5% of all benign brain tumor cases today. These tumors originate in the meninges – a membrane that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Women are twice as likely to develop meningiomas as men.; Peripheral Schwannomas: A common type of brain tumor that originates from Schwann cells - a group of cells that act as an \"insulating\" layer covering the outside of the nerves. Schwannoma often moves outside the nerve sheath instead of invading nerve cells, so it is a benign brain tumor.; Pituitary adenoma: The most common type of benign brain tumor after meningiomas and Schwannomas. Most pituitary tumors grow quite slowly. Even malignant pituitary tumors rarely metastasize to other parts of the body. Most pituitary tumors can be treated successfully.; Craniopharyngioma: Is a rare type of benign brain tumor but difficult to remove because of its location close to the pituitary stalk - an area that regulates many hormones in the body, deep in the brain.; Pineal gland tumor: A type of benign brain tumor - ranked I in the WHO tumor classification scale. Pineal tumors usually grow slowly, rarely recur and do not metastasize after being removed. They mainly occur in middle-aged people with an average age of disease of 38 years old; Glomus jugulare: Is a rare benign brain tumor, located just below the base of the skull, at the tip of the cone-shaped vein. Glomus tumor is the most common form of glomus tumor – accounting for 0.6% of all head and neck tumor cases.; Chordoma: These are benign, slow-growing tumors, most common in people between 50 and 60 years old. Their most common locations are the base of the skull and the lower part of the spine. These are rare tumors, accounting for only 0.2% of all primary brain tumors.",
