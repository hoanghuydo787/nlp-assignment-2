    "subsection_content": "Signs of benign brain tumors are different for each patient. In general, if you have a brain tumor, benign brain tumor symptoms can be divided into 2 groups: Symptoms due to intracranial pressure and Symptoms due to the location of the tumor.\nSymptoms due to increased intracranial pressure\nBenign brain tumors – no matter what part of the brain they develop in – can increase pressure inside the skull (intracranial pressure for short). Increased intracranial pressure can lead to a series of symptoms such as: (3)\nHeadache: The most common sign of a benign brain tumor. According to the American Brain Tumor Association, about 46-50% of people with brain tumors have headaches. However, you also need to note that not all headaches are caused by brain tumors.; Seizures: About 33% of people with a brain tumor will have a seizure at some point. Seizures caused by benign brain tumors are often focal seizures - seizures in one part of the body.; Nausea and vomiting: About 20% of patients with brain tumors often experience nausea or vomiting. This condition usually occurs in the morning, although it can appear at any time of the day; Dizziness, hearing loss: About 25% of brain tumor patients experience hearing and vision impairment according to a report by Musella Group - US Brain Tumor Research & Information Center.; Problems with coordination of activities: When the vestibular nervous system - the body's balance organ - is affected, the symptoms of benign brain tumors are loss of balance and sensation. wobbly, disoriented; Behavioral and cognitive changes: Including changes in personality and behavior, memory loss, difficulty concentrating, and saying or doing things that are inappropriate for the situation.\nHeadache is the most common symptom of benign brain tumors. However, not all headaches are caused by a brain tumor.\nSymptoms from tumor location\nDifferent parts of the brain control different functions, so benign brain tumor symptoms will vary depending on the location of the tumor. Such as:\nFrontal lobe: Tumors in the frontal lobe – the area that controls body movement and sensation – can cause weakness or numbness in one part of the body, one arm or leg.; Temporal lobe: Tumors in the temporal lobe - the area responsible for hearing, language, and memory can cause problems with slow understanding of words, forgetting other people's faces, affecting thinking, personality and communication.; Occipital lobe: Tumors in the occipital lobe, or around the pituitary gland or optic nerve can cause vision problems.; Parietal lobe: Benign brain tumors in the parietal lobe can cause dyslexia, difficulty writing, inability to calculate, count, difficulty with spatial perception and distance assessment.; Spinal cord: Spinal cord tumors can cause numbness, weakness, or lack of coordination in the arms and  legs (usually on both sides of the body), as well as bladder and bowel problems.; Cerebellar region: A brain tumor located in the cerebellum at the back of the head can cause difficulty with coordination, trouble with precise movements of the hands, arms, legs and feet; balance problems, weakness of certain facial muscles, facial numbness or pain, difficulty swallowing.; Brainstem region: Benign brain tumors in the brainstem region cause difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, heart rhythm and blood pressure disorders.; Pituitary region: The pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain - where it secretes hormones that regulate many processes in the body. Tumors in the pituitary gland can cause symptoms of increased or decreased hormone production leading to changes such as weight loss or gain, sexual dysfunction, feeling cold, excessive sweating, etc.\nNote: Just because you have one or more of the above benign brain tumor signs does not necessarily mean you have a benign brain tumor. All of these symptoms can originate from many different causes. However, if you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor to be screened for a benign brain tumor.",
