    "subsection_content": "In all cases, the exact cause of a benign brain tumor is impossible to determine. Researchers say brain tumors develop when certain genes on a cell's chromosomes are damaged and cannot function properly, but they are not sure why this happens.\nSome main factors that can be risk factors for causing mutations in DNA leading to benign brain tumors include:\nDue to diet: Regularly consuming alcohol and beer, eating foods containing N-nitroso compounds such as grilled meat, bacon, cheese, fermented vegetables, meat and fish left salted overnight increases the risk. DNA mutations can lead to brain tumors.; Due to sleep: Not sleeping on time, regularly not getting enough sleep or trying to catch up on sleep on weekends causes sleep disorders and cell circadian rhythm disorders.; Due to bad habits: Cigarette smoke is a toxic mixture of more than 7,000 chemicals. Regular smoking certainly increases the risk of benign brain tumors.; Due to environmental factors: Being near sources of air pollution, water sources or exposure to large amounts of radiation from X-rays due to previous cancer treatment can lead to DNA damage later.; Genetics: Only about 5% to 10% of people with brain tumors have a family history of brain tumors. There are a number of rare genetic syndromes, passed from parents to children, that are associated with brain tumors, including: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1 gene), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2 gene). Turcot syndrome (APC gene). Gorlin syndrome (PTCH gene). Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1 and TSC2 genes). Li-Fraumeni syndrome (TP53 gene).; Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1 gene), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2 gene).; Turcot syndrome (APC gene).; Gorlin syndrome (PTCH gene).; Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1 and TSC2 genes).; Li-Fraumeni syndrome (TP53 gene).\nBenign brain tumors can completely appear due to genetic inheritance",
