    "subsection_content": "The process of diagnosing benign brain tumors includes 3 steps:\nStep 1: General health check\nIf you are having symptoms of a benign brain tumor, your doctor will first conduct an interview and a general physical examination for you. Then, they will ask you:\nWhat are your symptoms? How does it happen?; What is your medical history? Include past and present health conditions, surgeries and medical treatments you have undergone, current medications you are taking, and family medical history.\nStep 2: Neurological examination\nAt this step, many exercises on reflexes and judgment will be prescribed by the doctor to look for abnormalities in:\nAbility between balance and motor coordination (holding, grasping, pointing, pointing, running, jumping).; Hearing and vision.; Behavioral awareness, reflexes, logical thinking, object perception; Mental state, emotions, communication ability (listening - speaking - reading - writing).\nThese abnormalities may indicate which part of your brain may be affected by a benign brain tumor.\nStep 3: Image diagnosis\nIf they suspect you have a benign brain tumor, your doctor will use a number of tests to further diagnose, including:\nMRI or CT brain scan: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best imaging test to identify benign brain tumors. Computed tomography (CT) is a good alternative if you cannot have an MRI.; Biopsy: Is the extraction of a small tumor sample and then examined under a microscope to determine the type of tumor and evaluate whether it is cancerous or not; Lumbar puncture: This procedure is performed when doctors suspect that the tumor has invaded your meninges. For this procedure, the doctor uses a small needle to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from around the spine. A laboratory will test this fluid for cancer cells.; Specialized tests: Include blood and cerebrospinal fluid tests for tumor markers – substances secreted by a tumor. They may also ask you to have a test to check for genetic abnormalities to find specific genes that can cause brain tumors.\nX-ray and MRI methods provide effective results in diagnosing benign brain tumors",
