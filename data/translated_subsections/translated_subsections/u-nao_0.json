Brain tumors can start directly from brain cells, glial cells of the central nervous system, or can also start from other parts (for example, lungs, kidneys...) and then follow the blood to the brain. called brain metastases. (first)\nMechanism of formation: Normally, from birth to death, no more nerve cells are born. When there are unexplained mutations in DNA that cause cells to divide uncontrollably, a brain tumor will form.; Effects: The growth rate and location of the brain tumor determine its severity and impact on nervous system function, even life-threatening if not diagnosed, monitored and treated. timely treatment.; Prevalence: Brain tumors account for 2% of all cancer cases from all age groups. Among cancer deaths in children under 15 years old and in the 20-39 age group, brain tumors are the second highest cause of death. People over 85 years old have the highest rate of brain tumors. .\nThe rate of brain tumors in older people is often higher.",
