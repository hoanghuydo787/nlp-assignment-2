    "subsection_content": "The brain is made up of countless different tissues and cells, so it can develop into many types of tumors. There are more than 130 different types of brain tumors with typical brain tumor signs. In particular, diseases are divided into groups including:\nDivided by origin: Brain tumors include 02 types: primary brain tumors and secondary brain tumors.; Divided by nature: Brain tumors include 02 types: benign brain tumors and malignant brain tumors.; Divided by level: Brain tumors include 04 types: brain tumors level 1, level 2, level 3, level 4.\nPrimary brain tumors and secondary brain tumors\nPrimary brain tumor\nPrimary brain tumors are brain tumors that form and develop on their own from cells of the brain and central nervous system (not due to transmission from other areas of the body). The cause of a primary brain tumor can also occur in the spinal cord, meninges (area covering the brain) or nerves leading from the brain.\nCharacteristics: 70% of primary brain tumors are benign (non-cancerous) brain tumors but 30% are malignant (cancerous) tumors. Primary brain tumors can be easily removed and completely cured if they are benign tumors.; Prevalence: The rate of cancer from primary brain tumors accounts for only 2% of the total number of cancer cases from other parts of the body.; Subject: The older people are, the more likely they are to develop primary brain tumors. Almost 25% of patients diagnosed with primary brain tumors in the UK are aged 75 or over. In addition, primary brain tumors are the second most common cancer (after acute lymphoblastic leukemia) in children under 15 years old.\nSecondary brain tumor\nSecondary brain tumors are tumors that appear in the brain because cancer cells from another organ (such as the lungs) have spread to the brain. Any type of cancer in the body, if not detected promptly, can metastasize, leading to secondary brain cancer.\nCharacteristics: Secondary brain tumors are always malignant tumors. In about 50% of cases, the cause of secondary brain tumors is metastasis from lung cancer, followed by metastasis from breast cancer, kidney, skin, colon, melanoma,...; Popularity: Secondary brain tumor cases account for 50-80% of the total number of brain tumor cases today, which is nearly four times the number of primary brain tumor cases.; Subjects: According to statistics, secondary brain tumors are common in the elderly group (aged 70 and older) and have a high risk of appearing in any subject who has or has a history of cancer.\nBenign brain tumors and malignant brain tumors\nBenign (non-cancerous) brain tumors\nDefinition: A benign brain tumor is a type of brain tumor that grows slowly, does not metastasize, and can be completely treated by surgically removing the tumor directly without the need for radiotherapy or chemotherapy.; Characteristics: Although benign tumors can be cured, they can still be life-threatening if not promptly removed through surgery. The disease is less likely to recur after surgery if it is completely removed. Therefore, you need to proactively have regular health checks to screen and early detect benign tumors (if any).\nMalignant brain tumor (cancer)\nDefinition: A malignant brain tumor is a type of brain tumor that contains cancer cells (cells that divide rapidly beyond control). This tumor easily attacks and metastasizes to neighboring healthy cells. The disease develops quickly, relapses easily and directly affects the patient's life.; Characteristics: When a patient has a malignant tumor, the treatment method is often a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. Malignant brain tumors account for nearly 30% of all primary brain tumors, while secondary brain tumors (due to metastasis) are 100% malignant.\nClassify tumors by grade\nThis classification divides brain tumors into 4 levels (also known as 4 stages) from stage 1 to stage 4.\nTo determine the grade (stage) of the tumor, the doctor will base it on the shape characteristics of the tumor cells observed under a microscope. The more normal the tumor cell sample looks (similar to healthy cells), the lower the brain tumor grade.\nBiological characteristics and treatment methods for brain tumors at each level also have big differences:\nBrain tumor grade / stage  Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Stage 4  Tumor cell identity  Looks a lot like healthy brain cells  Looks less like healthy brain cells Cells look more abnormal . The cells look very abnormal. Likelihood of growing, spreading  Slow, unlikely to spread Slow, possibly spreading Fast, easily spreading into other parts of the brain and spinal cord Fast, very contagious  Possibility of recurrence Less Likely High Very high  Treatment Surgery Surgery is the main thing, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy (if needed) You are more likely to need radiotherapy and chemotherapy after surgery. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy\nSome common types of brain tumors\nCurrently, there are 4 common types of brain tumors: (2)\nGliomas: Also called gliomas because they are brain tumors that start in glial cells in the brain or spinal cord. Gliomas are a type of malignant primary brain tumor, accounting for about 50.4% of all brain tumor cases and 78% of malignant primary brain tumor cases.; Meningioma: A slow-growing tumor that forms from the meninges or membrane surrounding the spinal cord. Meningiomas are benign tumors that often appear in women, accounting for about 20.8% of all brain tumor cases with a low recurrence rate after surgery (less than 20%).; Pituitary adenoma: A tumor that occurs in the pituitary gland (located on the surface below the brain) with more than 60% of cases diagnosed as benign, 35% as invasive tumors. According to statistics, pituitary tumors account for 10% - 25% of all brain tumors and the incidence can be up to 17% of the population.; Peripheral nerve tumors: Caused by fibroblasts that grow around nerve bundles and account for about 10% of all brain tumors. Most peripheral nerve tumors are benign (not cancerous). However, the tumor compresses the nerves causing pain and can cause loss of muscle control.\nThe earlier a brain tumor is detected, the higher the prognosis for cure. So what are the early signs of brain tumor?",
