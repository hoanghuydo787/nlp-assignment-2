In general, brain tumor signs are divided into 2 groups:\nGroup of brain tumor signs related to increased intracranial pressure causing nerve compression.; The group of brain tumor signs is caused by the location where the tumor appears.\nSigns of brain tumor due to intracranial pressure\nYour skull is the hard, thick layer of bone that surrounds the cerebral cortex. Therefore, any brain tumor growth inside such a narrow, closed and confined space can create a huge amount of intracranial pressure that compresses the nervous system.\nIn the group of brain tumor symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure, patients often feel: (3)\nHeadache: Headaches occur frequently with high frequency, especially when waking up in the morning or when coughing, sneezing, or exercising.; Epilepsy (convulsions): Up to 8 out of 10 people with brain tumors have seizures. You may experience convulsions in your hands, arms, legs, and may spread to your entire body.; Eyes and vision: Drooping eyelids, uneven pupils, blurred vision, dizziness, decreased vision.; Memory loss: Forgetfulness, absent-mindedness, temporary memory loss.; Reduced alertness: May include dizziness, drowsiness, difficulty sleeping, insomnia, unconsciousness, loss of consciousness.; Psychological instability: Changes in mood, personality, emotions and behavior, depression, feeling of loss of interest in even previous pleasures.; Other problems: Fever, low blood pressure, fatigue, chills, temperature sensitivity.\nHeadache is the most common symptom of a brain tumor\nSigns of brain tumor due to tumor location\nDepending on the tumor location, brain tumor symptoms are also very diverse and can affect different body parts. Specifically:\nSigns of a frontal lobe brain tumor: The frontal lobe controls movements like walking and is part of your personality. A tumor in the frontal lobe can cause: Arms and legs: Numbness in the arms, legs, tremors in the hands, tremors in the legs, uncontrolled hand movements, difficulty walking. Ears - Nose - Throat: Impaired ability to hear, taste or smell. It is easy to feel nauseous or vomit continuously. Change in voice, loss of appetite, loss of smell, weight loss. Body: Numbness or tingling on one side of the body,  weakness of one arm or leg, or twitching (especially in adults). Behavioral instability: Personality changes, behaving in ways you don't usually do; Hands and feet: Numbness in hands, feet, shaking hands, shaking legs, uncontrollable hand movements, difficulty walking.; Ears - Nose - Throat: Impaired ability to hear, taste or smell. It is easy to feel nauseous or vomit continuously. Change in voice, loss of appetite, loss of smell, weight loss; Body: Numbness or tingling on one side of the body,  weakness of one arm or leg, or convulsions (especially in adults).; Behavioral instability: Personality changes, behaving in ways you don't usually do; Temporal lobe brain tumor symptoms: The temporal lobe is where you process sound and where you store memories. A tumor in this area can cause: Short-term memory loss. Difficulty hearing and speaking; Short-term memory loss.; Difficulty hearing and speaking; Signs of parietal brain tumor: The parietal lobe allows you to recognize objects and store that knowledge. A tumor in this area can cause: Difficulty writing, difficulty reading, difficulty swallowing, difficulty understanding what others are saying. Loss of feeling in part of the body; Difficulty writing, reading, swallowing, understanding what others are saying; Loss of feeling in part of the body; Occipital lobe brain tumor symptoms: The occipital lobe processes what you can see. A tumor located in this area can cause vision problems such as darkened vision, dizziness, and blurred images. Difficulty determining the color and size of the object.; Vision is dark, dizziness, images are blurred; Difficulty determining the color and size of the object.; Signs of a brain tumor in the cerebellum: The cerebellum controls our balance and posture. So, a tumor in this area can cause: Problems with coordination, walking and balance. Uncontrolled eye movements such as eyelid twitching; Problems with walking coordination and balance; Uncontrolled eye movements such as eyelid twitching; Brain stem tumor symptoms: The brain stem controls important body functions such as breathing. A tumor in this area can cause: Difficulty swallowing and speaking. Staggering and difficulty walking; Difficulty swallowing and speaking; Staggering and difficulty walking; Symptoms of a pituitary brain tumor: The pituitary gland makes important hormones for your body to function. A tumor in this area of ​​the brain can cause: Weight gain, high blood sugar (diabetes). Infertility, milk leakage from the breasts even if you are not breastfeeding. Mood changes, increased blood pressure; Weight gain, high blood sugar (diabetes).; Infertility, milk leakage from the breasts even if you are not breastfeeding.; Mood changes, increased blood pressure; Pineal brain tumor symptoms: The pineal gland produces a hormone called melatonin that is in charge of controlling sleep. Tumors in this area can cause: Insomnia, fatigue, headaches. Loss of balance when walking; Insomnia, fatigue, headache; Loss of balance when walking; Signs of spinal cord tumors: The spinal cord is a long bundle of nerves that stretches from the brain to the lower part of the back. A tumor in the spinal cord can cause pain and numbness or weakness in different parts of the body. You may also lose control of your bladder or bowels, affecting excretion and digestion.\nBrain tumors in different brain regions will give different symptoms",
