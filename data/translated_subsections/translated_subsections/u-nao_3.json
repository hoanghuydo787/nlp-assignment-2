Anything that increases your chance of getting a brain tumor can be considered a risk factor for the disease (i.e., an underlying cause).\nJust because you have one of the brain tumor risk factors below does not guarantee that you will get a brain tumor in the future. Risk factors that increase the risk of brain tumors may be: (4)\nAge\nThe older a person is, the more likely they are to get a brain tumor. Most brain tumors occur in adults between the ages of 85 and 89, although some types of brain tumors are more common in children under 15 years of age.\nFamily history (genetics)\nAccording to reports, only 5-10% of all cancer cases are hereditary. Brain tumors account for only 2% of all cancers worldwide, so the rate of inherited brain tumors is very low.; Some genetic conditions are known to increase the risk of brain tumors, including: tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis type 1, type 2, Turner syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Turcot syndrome , Gorlin syndrome,…\nUnscientific diet\nSome studies have shown that dietary N-nitroso compounds may influence the risk of brain tumors in children and adults.; Recently, Dr. Lee Wrensch discovered that people with glioma had a high incidence of consuming diets low in fruits, vegetables, and vitamin C that were high in nitrites such as cheese, fish, bacon, and processed foods. processed, fermented, salted overnight (dried fish), canned.\nOverweight and obesity\nBeing overweight or obese increases the risk of meningioma. Around 2% of all brain tumor diagnoses in the UK each year are due to being overweight or obese.; Trying to maintain a healthy weight by participating in physical activity and eating moderately is essential.\nThere was no history of chickenpox\nAccording to a 2016 report published in the journal Cancer Medicine, people who had no history of chickenpox in childhood were 21% more likely to develop glioma than people who had chickenpox. .\nChemical exposure\nSome occupations, due to their specific working environment, require exposure to many chemicals that can increase the risk of brain cancer, such as:\nAgricultural workers have to be exposed to a lot of pesticides; Workers working in environments high in heavy metals (nickel, mercury).; People working in the construction materials industry, roofing sheets, tiles, boat building, etc. due to heavy exposure to asbestos can cause brain tumors.; People living near industrial wastewater sources and collective landfills containing Vinyl Chloride.; Petroleum workers who do not properly protect themselves inhale aromatic compounds such as benzene and ethylbenzene for long periods of time.\nEating unscientifically or living near sources of pollution also increases the risk of brain tumors\nExposure to radiation\nIonizing radiation is a type of radiation used by some medical scanning procedures, such as X-rays and CT scans. People who have been exposed to ionizing radiation have a higher risk of brain tumors than the general population.
