The disease, whether treated promptly or not, can easily leave certain complications, seriously affecting daily life, shortening the patient's lifespan or even threatening life.\nThese complications vary in severity depending on the condition, including:\nHeadache - dizziness - vertigo: Is the most common complication after brain tumor treatment. This side effect comes from the fact that the surgical wound has not yet healed and the anesthetic has not yet worn off.; Fatigue - drowsiness: The effects of sedatives used during brain tumor surgery can give you a feeling of drowsiness and weak limbs after treatment.; Sore throat: During brain tumor surgery, the patient will have a breathing tube (through the throat) placed to regulate breathing and the amount of oxygen reaching the brain. Therefore, when surgery is over, a sore throat is not a rare complication.; Communication impairment: Some patients after brain tumor treatment are slow to speak, slow to read, slow to write, slow to understand, have poor communication reflexes, slurred speech, etc., affecting their ability to communicate daily; Sensory and motor impairment: Eyes may be blurred, ears may be slightly deaf, taste loss, nose taste loss, limbs numb, partially paralyzed, weak, trembling or difficult to control, maintaining balance are different complications that occur depending on the body.; Reduced life expectancy or death:\nWith benign brain tumors: The 5-year survival rate for meningiomas, the most common type of benign primary brain tumor, is over 96% for children 14 years of age and younger, 97% for those aged 14 years and younger. 15 to 39 years old and over 87% in adults 40 years and older.
