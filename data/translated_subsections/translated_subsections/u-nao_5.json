    "subsection_content": "Diagnosing a brain tumor begins with a detailed assessment of your nervous system reflexes. To check to see if your cranial nerves are still working well, your doctor will conduct many tests such as:\nUse an ophthalmoscope: To see how your pupils react to light.; Test muscle strength: Hand and foot coordination, balance ability, temporary memory ability as well as arithmetic calculation ability.\nThen, your doctor will ask you to perform one or more tests to get an accurate conclusion. These tests may include:\nSkull X-ray: Uses X-rays to detect microscopic skull fractures caused by brain tumors. If the tumor metastasizes into the blood, X-rays can also detect it; Head CT scan: Still uses X-rays but gives more detailed images than X-rays with the help of a computer. CT scans help doctors see the internal structures of the brain and the vascular system more clearly.; Head MRI: Also known as magnetic resonance imaging, provides superior image quality compared to CT scanning, clearly depicting brain parenchyma thanks to higher contrast.\nAngiogram: You will have dye injected into your arteries. This method allows doctors to monitor how well the blood supply is feeding the tumor.\nBiopsy sample: A small piece of brain tumor cells will be extracted and tested to determine the tumor stage and tumor type (primary or secondary).",
