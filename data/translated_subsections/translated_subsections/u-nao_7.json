You can only prevent brain tumors by minimizing potential risks such as:\nGive up bad habits: Drinking alcohol, smoking, staying up late, living irregularly; Eat healthy: Rich in fruits and vegetables, vitamin C and limit foods rich in Nitrite such as smoked spray, canned food, fast food, grilled and fried foods.; Increase exercise: Exercise to improve general health; Stay away from radioactive sources: Limit exposure to excessive radioactive sources and ionizing radiation such as X-ray machines, CT scan machines,... and from other special machines.",
