    "subsection_content": "Are brain tumors hereditary?\nBrain tumors can be hereditary, but the rate is so RARE that it is considered almost NOT hereditary. Only 5-10% of all cancers in the world are due to genetics and only 2% of all cancers are due to brain tumors. Simply put, only 0.1%-0.2% of all cancer cases worldwide are due to hereditary brain tumors, so you absolutely do not need to worry.\nCan benign brain tumors be cured?\nBenign brain tumors can be cured with surgery if treated early, when the tumor is completely removed and has not left too far-reaching consequences. The possibility of recurrence after surgery of benign brain tumors is quite low, so the cure rate of benign brain tumors is very high.\nCan malignant brain tumors be cured?\nMalignant brain tumors CAN be cured and they CAN NOT be cured. Prognosis (success rate) when treating malignant brain tumors depends entirely on the following factors:\nTumor type: Stage 3 and 4 brain tumors have a worse prognosis than stages 1 and 2; Tumor location: The more important the tumor is (for example, near the optic nerve), the greater the risk. The deeper the brain tumor is in the brain, the more difficult it is to operate.; Tumor size: The larger the brain tumor, the lower the prognosis for cure; Extent and speed of metastasis: Brain tumors that metastasize quickly have a lower cure prognosis than brain tumors that metastasize slowly; Degree of tumor response: The more \"stubborn\" the tumor is to the drug, the worse the prognosis; General health: The more positive your general health information (age, family history, underlying medical conditions, etc.) is, the higher the chance of curing a brain tumor. The outlook for treatment of malignant brain tumors is often better for people under 40 years of age.; Other factors: Other abnormal signs of cells, tumor shape, possibility of recurrence,...\nWhen to see a doctor?\nSee your doctor immediately if you have signs of a brain tumor such as seizures, dizziness, lightheadedness, or headaches. Especially, if you have a headache that is different from the types of headaches you often experience such as:\nHeadache is getting worse; Headache every morning when waking up.; Headache every time you move, sneeze, cough or move your body.\nAs soon as the above signs appear, you should immediately go to the nearest general practitioner to get the earliest diagnosis. The first and only in Vietnam, Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City applies the most modern Modus V Synaptive Brain Surgery Robot in brain tumor surgery as well as dangerous neurological and cranial diseases.\nThanks to the ability to harmonize MRI, DTI, CT, DSA images... - which no machine or technique has been able to do before, the Modus V Synaptive Robot helps doctors clearly see brain tumors or damaged brain areas. injuries in relation to nerve conduction bundles, healthy brain tissues... on the same vivid 3D image, with many different dimensions.\nThe robot also allows doctors to perform 3D simulation surgery before starting the actual surgery, thereby proactively choosing a safe path to approach the tumor, without damaging healthy nerves and brain tissue, ensuring the avoidance of harm. maximize the risk of postoperative complications.\nDuring official surgery, the Modus V Synaptive Robot also has the function of monitoring throughout the surgery process, warning with light signals (red - yellow - blue) to help doctors operate safely, ensuring surgical lines and equipment. The operated object is inserted into the brain at the correct position established in the simulated surgery. This helps bring outstanding efficiency to the surgical process, helping to maximize brain tumor resection, allowing the patient to recover quickly, return home early, and preserve the patient's functions at the highest level. The cost of performing surgery with the Modus V Synaptive Robot is also saved dozens of times compared to robotic surgery abroad.\nTo schedule an examination and consultation on health issues in general and brain tumor diagnosis and treatment in particular at Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nAbove is the most basic information you need to know about brain tumors. Hopefully through this article you somewhat know what brain tumors are, what causes brain tumors, what are the signs and symptoms of brain tumors to prevent the disease.\nHowever, health checks in general and periodic brain tumor screening in particular still play an important role in effective disease prevention. Because the longer a brain tumor lasts, the more damage it causes to health and threatens life. Contact Tam Anh General Hospital System immediately if you have any signs of a brain tumor such as headaches, dizziness, seizures, etc. to be examined and screened promptly.",
