    "subsection_content": "Frontal sinus mucoceles (Mucoceles) are a type of tumor filled with mucus, growing on the frontal sinus.\nA mucocele is a collection of mucus enclosed in a sac of sinus epithelium lining the air sinus due to obstruction of the sinus opening. But the cause can also be infection, fibrosis, inflammation, trauma, surgery or obstruction by tumors such as osteosarcoma.\nMucoceles are benign, slow-growing lesions that often occur in the frontal or ethmoid sinuses and rarely appear in the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. The cyst may be filled with pus due to chronic infection, in which case it is called a chronic purulent mucocele.",
