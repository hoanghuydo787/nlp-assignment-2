    "subsection_content": "The clinical manifestations of frontal sinus myxomas vary depending on their anatomical location. The initial symptoms are often insidious.\nPatients with frontal ethmoid mucocele may develop frontal headaches, facial misalignment, or swelling. Ocular manifestations may also be found, such as impaired vision, reduced eye mobility, or proptosis.\nClinical manifestations vary from asymptomatic to disabling headaches and visual disturbances. Visual disturbances (83%) and double vision (45%) were the most common complaints.\nDuring a physical examination, the doctor can identify pain around the eye socket, swelling, infection, decreased vision and limited eye movements.\nIntracranial invasion due to erosion of the posterior wall of the frontal sinus can lead to meningitis or cerebrospinal fluid leak. The posterior wall of the frontal sinus is especially susceptible to erosion because it is inherently very thin. A tendency toward bone erosion and intracranial invasion is seen more frequently in the presence of infection.\nThe presence and direction of proptosis can be of significant help in determining the location of the lesion. A mass at the orbital apex tends to produce proptosis directly anteriorly, whereas lesions directed anteriorly toward the vestibular region produce lateral exophthalmos, with lesions directed downward and anteriorly, similarly. such as due to damage invading the orbit from the frontal sinus.\nDamage to the ethmoid sinus area in newborns produces exophthalmos that is characterized by bulging outward, forward, and superior. All of this helps differentiate it from lesions in the lacrimal sac that often cause confusion.\nFrontal sinus mucocele causes compression of the eye socket, leading to bulging eyes, double vision, and swelling of the eye socket, which are typical signs.
