CT scan\nThere are three criteria for CT diagnosis of a frontal sinus mucocele including:\nThe mass has uniform density, clear margins, and peritumoral bone destruction; Sinus wall erosion with marginal fibrosis is also a sign.\n2. MRI scan\nOften indicated in the differential diagnosis of complicated cases that cannot be identified by CT scan.\nCases requiring an MRI include:\nDermoid cyst.; Langerhans cell histiocytosis.; Fungal infections and tuberculosis; Cholesterol granuloma in the forehead - orbit.; Other uncommon tumors.\nTypically, frontal sinus myxoma tends to be bright on T1-weighted images compared to the brain and hyperdense on T2-weighted images.",
