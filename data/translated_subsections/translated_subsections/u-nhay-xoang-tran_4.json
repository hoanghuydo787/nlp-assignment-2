    "subsection_content": "Mucomas often behave as invasive lesions causing bone erosion and displacement of surrounding structures. The association of frontal sinus myxoma with the brain can cause complications and possibly death if not treated.\nThe most common complications of frontal sinus mucocele:\nUnilateral proptosis: Frontal sinus mucocele compressing the eye socket is a serious complication that affects vision, double vision, eye pain, proptosis and risk of blindness.; Encephalitis and meningitis: If the tumor compresses the brain, it can cause inflammation of the brain and meninges. This is a dangerous condition that can cause death if not treated promptly.; Facial paralysis: If the mucocele causes compression of the facial nerve, it can lead to facial deviation and facial paralysis.; Epilepsy: Epilepsy and paralysis of some organs may occur if the mucocele presses on central nervous structures.",
