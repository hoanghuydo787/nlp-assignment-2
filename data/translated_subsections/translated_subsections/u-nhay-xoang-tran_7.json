    "subsection_content": "1. Does frontal sinus mucocele inserting into the eye socket cause blindness?\nFrontal sinus mucocele compressing the eye socket is a dangerous complication of frontal sinus mucocele. It can lead to bulging eyes, even eye swelling and risk of blindness.\n2. Can frontal sinus mucocele be cured?\nUncomplicated frontal sinus mucocele can easily be treated endoscopically with high effectiveness. For cases with complications, treatment is more complicated and prognosis depends largely on the location and extent of the complication.\nResolving intracranial complications is often difficult and can leave sequelae. Therefore, it is important that patients treat mucocele as soon as it appears.\n3. Is frontal sinus mucocele that compresses the eye socket dangerous?\nThis is a benign type of nasal sinus tumor, mainly occurring in adults. However, due to its corrosive nature, causing bone loss of the sinus wall and causing compression of craniofacial structures, this type of tumor is potentially dangerous.\nA rare case of frontal sinus mucocele after sinus surgery at Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City\nEar, Nose and Throat doctors at Tam Anh Hospital received and successfully operated on a case of frontal sinus mucocele compressing the eye socket after sinus surgery many years ago.\nA 44-year-old female patient from Da Lat came to Tam Anh General Hospital for examination with recurring swelling of the inner corner of her left eye, accompanied by increased headaches in the forehead and recurring many times.
