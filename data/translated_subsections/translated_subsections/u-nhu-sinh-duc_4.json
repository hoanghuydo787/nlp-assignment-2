However, patients can distinguish genital warts from benign genital papillomas through the following points:\n1.

Genital warts do not share a common stem and do not contain pus; Genital papillomas develop very slowly, hardly growing over time.; The location of genital papillomas is mostly in the male and female genital organs. Tongue cases are very rare.\n2. Genital warts\nGenital warts are initially papules that grow individually and then grow together into clusters. These pimples are very similar to cauliflower or genital warts, so they are called genital warts.; Genital warts are light pink in color and protrude from the surface of the skin, growing in size and number over time.; In addition to growing on the genitals, genital warts also appear on the tongue, mouth and anus.; Genital warts are easily transmitted through sexual contact, from mother to child and contact with open wounds.\nGenital papillomas grow in small clusters and do not cause pain",
