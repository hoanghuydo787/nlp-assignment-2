    "subsection_content": "According to experts at the Center for Urology and Nephrology, Tam Anh General Hospital System, benign kidney tumors are often classified according to where they develop, including the following types: (2)\n1. Renal adenoma\nAdenomas form in the thin layer of tissue that covers glands, organs, and other internal structures. For example, polyps form in the colon, liver... In the kidney, kidney tumors (Adenoma) appear a lot and are characterized as benign. Each of these tumors is usually about 2 cm in size, in the outer shell area separate from the kidney, gray or light yellow in color.\n2. Granulosa cell tumor\nOncocytoma is quite rare and occurs more often in men. This tumor is formed from large epithelial cells, about 12 cm in diameter, yellow or light brown in color. Granulosa cell tumor is also a benign kidney tumor, so it has very little risk of invading neighboring tissues.\n3. Renal fatty leiomyoma\nCompared to the two types of benign tumors mentioned above, renal liposarcoma is the rarest type, but has a higher risk of developing into a malignant tumor. This tumor formation is related to tuberous sclerosis, a neurological syndrome related to genetic disorders and genotypes that cause epilepsy and mental retardation...\n4. Single kidney cyst\nA single kidney cyst is a condition in which an abnormal mass of fluid appears on one or both sides of the kidney. This tumor is usually round, has fluid inside and does not invade the renal pelvis. This case often appears in older people. The older a person is, the higher the risk of having a simple kidney cyst.",
