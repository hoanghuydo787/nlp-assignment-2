The majority of thymoma are benign and surrounded by a fibrous capsule;; Germ cell: 60-70% of germ cell tumors are benign, common in both men and women;; Mediastinal thyroid mass: usually a benign tumor, such as a goiter.\nMiddle mediastinum\nBronchial cyst: is a benign growth originating from the respiratory tract;; Mediastinal lymphadenopathy: enlarged lymph nodes;; Pericardial cyst: primary malignant tumor of the pericardium;; Tracheal tumors: can be benign or malignant;; Esophageal tumors: can be benign or malignant;; Esophageal abnormalities: including esophageal dilatation, diverticula, and hip hernia;; Vascular abnormalities: including aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection.\nPosterior mediastinum\nNeuroendocrine tumors: are the most common cause of posterior mediastinal tumors, classified into nerve sheath tumors, ganglion cell tumors, and paraganglionic cell tumors. About 70% of neuroendocrine tumors are benign;; Lymphadenopathy: due to proliferation of lymph nodes;; Neurogenic cyst: is a rare tumor, related to both nervous and gastrointestinal factors;; Spinal abnormalities: including infectious abnormalities, malignant tumors, and thoracic trauma;; Vascular abnormalities: including aortic aneurysm.",
