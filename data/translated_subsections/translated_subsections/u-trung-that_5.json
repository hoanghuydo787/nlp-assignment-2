Doctors can perform minimally invasive techniques such as thoracoscopy, robotic resection, or with midsegmentectomy – an open approach that splits the sternum in half.; Lymphomas are treated with chemotherapy, followed by radiation therapy. Your doctor may also perform surgery to remove diagnostic tissue.; Neuroendocrine tumors that develop in the posterior mediastinum are treated surgically.\nSome tumors that are benign and have not affected surrounding organs are treated medically. The doctor will monitor their development and perform surgery when necessary.\nDoctors performed laparoscopic surgery to remove mediastinal tumors for patients at Tam Anh General Hospital\nAdvantages of minimally invasive surgery in treating medulloblastoma\nCompared to traditional surgery, patients who undergo minimally invasive surgery, such as thoracoscopic mediastinal tumor removal, will enjoy many benefits such as:\nLess pain after surgery; Shorter hospital stay; Faster recovery and early return to daily activities; Reduced risk of infection; Less bleeding during and after surgery\nRisks of surgery\nCompared with traditional open surgery, laparoscopic surgery to remove mediastinal tumors has helped minimize complications during and after surgery. However, there are still risks to this minimally invasive method. Those risks include:\nDamage to surrounding areas including the heart, pericardium, and spinal cord;; Bleeding heavily during surgery, the patient needed a blood transfusion and the doctor had to make a larger incision;; Pleural effusion;; Postoperative drainage;; Infection and heavy bleeding in the postoperative period.\nAt Tam Anh General Hospital, doctors will give specific instructions to help patients prepare well for surgery. In the post-operative period, the patient will also be given detailed instructions on how to care for the surgical wound, a suitable diet and a reasonable exercise regimen to quickly recover health.",
