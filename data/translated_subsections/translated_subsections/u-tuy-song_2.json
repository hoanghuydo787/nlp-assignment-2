Many theories suggest that spinal cord tumors are caused by defective genes. However, there are still many issues that need to be answered around this hypothesis, such as whether gene defects are inherited or are only formed due to the living environment, when exposed to chemicals,...\nThe exact cause of spinal cord tumors has not been found\nRisk factors\nSome conditions with a higher risk of developing spinal cord tumors include:\nNeurofibromatosis type 2: This genetic disorder causes tumors in nerve tissue, mainly congenital acoustic neuromas (vestibular cell tumors). Neurofibromatosis type 2 is often inherited from parents to children; Von Hippel-Lindau disease: This inherited neurological disorder can affect many organs of the body and increases the risk of spinal cord tumor. People with the disease can suffer blindness, brain damage or death.",
