Accordingly, types of spinal cord tumors include:\nMeningioma – accounts for a high rate of about 15-25%; Nerve root tumor (Neurinoma) – has a rate of 30 – 50%; Ependymoma; Astrocytoma; Dermoid cyst; Lipoma; Lymphoma; Haemangioma.\nBesides, there are some other less common types of spinal cord tumors such as chondromas, metastatic tumors, mixed tumors, etc.\nAccording to anatomy\nSpinal cord tumors can be classified into intramedullary tumors and extra-medullar tumors. In there:\nIntramedullary tumors, i.e. tumors located in the intramedullary canal, cysts, spongioblastomas or lipomas,... account for only about 5-10%.; Extramedullary - subdural tumors: These are benign tumors, usually located in the spinal membrane and are extremely common, accounting for more than 65%. Cases of spinal cord tumors located under the dura mater rarely cause damage to the spinal cord and nerve roots.; Extramedullary - extradural tumor (extradural - extramedulle tumor): This form of spinal cord tumor usually accounts for a lower rate, only about 15-25% in cases of metastatic tumors, hemangiomas, bone tumors,...; Mixed tumors: Mixed tumors are tumors located both inside and outside the dura mater. Typically, this type of spinal cord tumor will have an hourglass shape or a bisaccular tumor. In particular, an hourglass-shaped tumor will have part of the tumor located directly inside the spinal canal and part of the tumor will lie outside the spinal canal.",
