PET scan results help doctors evaluate the stage of the disease, determine the location where a biopsy is needed and consider appropriate treatment options.; Biopsy: The doctor will remove small pieces of brain or spinal cord tissue to check for tumor cells. A biopsy is often the only way to know exactly what type of spinal cord tumor is inside the patient's body.",
