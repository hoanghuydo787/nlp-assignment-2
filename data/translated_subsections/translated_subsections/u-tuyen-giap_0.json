    "subsection_content": "What is thyroid tumor? Thyroid tumors are also known as thyroid nodules. These are solid or liquid nodules/masses formed within the thyroid parenchyma. The thyroid is a small gland located in the front neck, just above the sternum.\nMost thyroid nodules are not serious and do not cause symptoms, so they are not easy to detect. Instead, it is often discovered accidentally during a routine health check-up via ultrasound of the neck. Thyroid tumors are usually benign, but a few are cancerous. A thyroid tumor shows symptoms when it has grown large, compressing and causing difficulty with breathing and swallowing activities.",
