    "subsection_content": "Initial assessment for patients with thyroid nodules includes taking the patient's personal and family history, physical examination, testing for thyroid hormones (FT3, FT4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and thyroid ultrasound to determine the characteristics of thyroid nodules.\nAfter ultrasound detects a thyroid nodule or tumor, the doctor will prescribe a fine needle aspiration of the thyroid nodule/tumor usually under ultrasound guidance to increase the accuracy of cytology testing and identify thyroid nodules. The nature of the tumor is benign or malignant to guide management and treatment. In some cases, genetic testing, immunohistochemical markers as well as further assessment imaging are needed: tissue elastography, MRI, CT and FDG-PET/CT. (4)\nThyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) test\nIn every patient with a thyroid nodule, a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test should be the initial test and used as a guide to further management.\nNormal or high thyroid-stimulating hormone levels often cause concern due to the risk of malignancy. However, low thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are usually a benign nodule.\nThe next step in a patient with low thyroid-stimulating hormone levels is to evaluate the possibility of a thyrotoxic nodule (hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule) by performing a thyroid scan with Tc-99m or Iodine 131. Self-functioning thyroid nodules are usually benign and rarely require further diagnosis.\nThyroid ultrasound\nThyroid ultrasound is an important diagnostic imaging technique used to evaluate thyroid nodules. This method provides information about size, structure, and parenchymal changes and can detect lesions as small as 2 mm.\nThyroid ultrasound is often used to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions and to prevent patients from having to undergo unnecessary invasive procedures.\nSome features that are associated with malignancy and considered independent risk factors include microcalcifications, irregular margins, strong hypoechoicity, greater height than width, and hypervascularity.\nThyroid ultrasound is highly sensitive in detecting small thyroid nodules that are difficult to detect by palpation.\nFine needle aspiration (FNA)\nFNA forms the foundation for thyroid nodule evaluation, representing the most cost-effective diagnostic tool used in thyroid nodule evaluation. The use of ultrasound-guided FNA is preferred over non-ultrasound guidance due to its associated accuracy and rate of false negative results.\nThe decision to perform FNA should be based on individual risk stratification using the patient's medical history, physical examination, and ultrasound results. Nodules <1cm were FNAed when there was more than one suspicious ultrasound feature, cervical lymphadenopathy, or high-risk history.\nFine needle aspiration cytology is indicated to determine whether the thyroid tumor is benign or malignant.\nCytological diagnosis\nThe US National Cancer Institute recommends, using the Bethesda classification, stratification of cytologic findings into 6 major categories, each of which dictates different evaluation and subsequent management.\nThe diagnostic categories of the Bethesda system for reporting thyroid cytology are described as follows:\nNot diagnosed/unsatisfactory\nThe sample does not have enough cells for evaluation.\nBenign\nMay be: Normal, benign thyroid tissue, or adenomatous nodules, or Hashimoto's thyroiditis and subacute granulomatous thyroiditis.\nLesion of undetermined significance (AUS – an undetermined significance) or cystic lesion of undetermined significance (FLUS – follicular lesion of undetermined significance)\nRecommended for convincingly non-benign lesions.
