The final FNA results will guide treatment.\nFNA cytology results provide 6 main diagnostic categories (Bethesda classification), all of which indicate different subsequent management.\nUndiagnosed: Cancer risk 1-4%.; Benign: Risk of cancer 0-3%.; Lesions of undetermined significance or cystic lesions of undetermined significance: Risk of cancer 5-15%.; Neoplasm or suspected neoplasm: Risk of cancer 15-30%.; Suspected of malignancy: Risk of cancer 60-75%.; Malignant: Risk of cancer 97-99%.\nA nondiagnostic biopsy (Bethesda I) was considered cytologically inadequate. The absence of malignant cells should not be interpreted as a negative biopsy if little cystic tissue is obtained. FNA is usually repeated after 4 – 6 weeks.\nPatients with benign nodules (Bethesda II), such as macroadenomas, colloid adenomas, nodular goiters, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, are typically followed without surgery. Regularly monitor with initial ultrasound from 12 to 24 months. If the ultrasound shows suspicious findings, the FNA should be repeated within 12 months even though the initial biopsy was benign.\nFor nodules with indeterminate cytology (Bethesda III and IV), the approach varies according to institutional practice. Some facilities take additional FNA samples for further testing, while other centers repeat the FNA after 6-12 weeks.\nFor nodules within the Bethesda V classification, where malignancy is suspected, treatment should include surgery. Bethesda VI includes papillary cancer, medullary cancer, undifferentiated cancer, and metastatic cancer to the thyroid. These patients should also be referred for surgery.",
