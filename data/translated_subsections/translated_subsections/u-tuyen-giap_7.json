Some patients with high risk factors such as normal to high serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, history of irradiation, or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome should be monitored. more closely periodically. Some ultrasound features that may also raise concerns about thyroid cancer include microcalcifications and irregular margins, a taller-than-wide appearance, and increased vascularity.\nAlthough solitary nodules have a higher risk of malignancy than nodules in a multinodular thyroid, the overall risk of malignancy will be approximately equal. This is due to the cumulative risk of each nodule in patients with multinodular glands.\nThe prognosis for thyroid malignancy will vary widely depending on the histopathological type of the cancer. In addition, some individual characteristics are also related to the prognosis of malignant thyroid cancer such as age at diagnosis, size of the primary tumor, presence of soft tissue invasion or distant metastasis.\nOther factors associated with increased recurrence or death from malignancy include male gender, mediastinal lymph node involvement, and delay in surgical treatment.\nFollicular cancer usually occurs in older patients and follows an aggressive course. It is often associated with distant metastases and a higher mortality rate than papillary thyroid cancer.",
