Simple classification of salivary gland tumors includes:\n1. Benign tumor\nIncluding benign pleomorphic adenoma, Warthin tumor (adenolymphoma), myoepithelioma, basal cell adenoma... Among benign parotid tumors, there are still types that have the potential to turn malignant. count.\n2. Malignant tumor\nIncludes mucinous adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), undifferentiated carcinoma, pleomorphic adenocarcinoma…\nA rule of thumb to remember about salivary gland tumors: 80% of salivary gland tumors are parotid, 80% of parotid tumors are benign, and 80% of benign tumors arise In the parotid gland is a benign pleomorphic adenoma, Warthin's tumor is the second most common benign lesion. The most common malignant tumors are mucoepidermoid carcinoma, followed by acinic cell carcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma.(4)\nNote that the parotid gland is a frequent site of metastasis due to squamous cell carcinoma arising in the scalp and neck. This means that malignant parotid tumors sometimes do not originate from the salivary glands.",
