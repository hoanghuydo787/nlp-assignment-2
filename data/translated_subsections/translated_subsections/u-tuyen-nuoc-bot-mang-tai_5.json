    "subsection_content": "According to Dr. Thuy Hang, examining and palpating the tumor is the initial diagnostic method for parotid gland tumors. Examination of the mouth should coincide with examination of the relevant salivary gland duct.\nNext, evaluation of the facial nerve and palpation of the cervical lymph nodes are mandatory steps. If there is facial nerve paralysis, it may be a sign of a malignant lesion with invasion of the nerve. The scalp and neck should also be examined for lesions suspicious for cancer.\nIn patients with suspected malignant parotid tumors, the following tests should be performed for diagnosis:(5)\n1. Fine needle aspiration biopsy\nFine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is the primary diagnostic tool for salivary gland lesions. This is a painless procedure with few complications, which can help prevent inaccurate surgery or specialized biopsies.\nIf the results of the FNA are inconsistent with other findings, clinical evaluation is recommended. Occasionally, FNA results can be false negative leading to misdiagnosis of malignant lesions. Therefore, it needs to be considered carefully.\n2. Ultrasound\nThis method helps provide important information about the location, size and nature of the salivary gland tumor as well as the presence of enlarged cervical lymph nodes associated with the tumor.\nThe location of the tumor in the superficial or deep part of the parotid gland is determined by determining the relationship of the tumor to the submandibular vein. Ultrasound, often combined with FNA, can help distinguish malignant from benign in 80-90% of cases.\n3. MRI scan\nMRI of parotid tumors is useful in evaluating and identifying anatomical structures, extension into the deep lobe, and facial nerve involvement.",
