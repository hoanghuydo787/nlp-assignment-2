    "subsection_content": "Doctor Thuy Hang said: \"Normally, if the tumor originates from the parotid gland (large salivary gland), 80% will be benign, 20% will be malignant. In contrast to tumors originating from small salivary glands (submandibular and sublingual glands), 80% are malignant and 20% are benign. However, secondary salivary gland malignant tumors often metastasize earlier than parotid malignant tumors.\nIf it is a malignant tumor of the parotid gland in particular or the salivary gland in general, the prognosis will depend on the following factors:\nTumor characteristics: The larger the size and the invasion of the capsule or surrounding tissues such as skin, nerves, and blood vessels, the worse the prognosis.; Cell characteristics on pathology: Whether there is metastasis to multiple lymph nodes or not; The 5-year survival rate of salivary gland malignant tumors ranges from 50-75%.",
