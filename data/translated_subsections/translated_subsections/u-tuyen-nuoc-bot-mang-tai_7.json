    "subsection_content": "According to Dr. Thuy Hang, depending on the nature of the salivary gland tumor, appropriate treatment methods can be chosen.\n1. Treatment of benign tumors\nSurgical treatment of benign tumors is a common indication. However, if the tumor is not surgically removed completely, it can lead to recurrence.\n2. Treatment of melanoma\nFor malignant salivary gland tumors, the treatment of choice is surgery, sometimes combined with radiation therapy. Currently, there is no effective chemotherapy for salivary gland cancer.\nTreatment of mucoepidermoid carcinoma includes: Wide excision and postoperative radiation therapy for high-grade lesions. The five-year survival rate is 95% for the low-grade type, which mainly affects mucus cells, and 50% for the high-grade type, which mainly affects epidermal cells. If there is metastasis to regional lymphatics, surgical excision and postoperative radiotherapy are required.; Treatment of mucoepidermoid carcinoma includes: Wide excision and postoperative radiation therapy for high-grade lesions.

If there is metastasis to regional lymphatics, surgical excision and postoperative radiotherapy are required.\nTreatment of adenoid cystic carcinoma: Surgery is often performed to remove the tumor extensively, but it easily causes local recurrence due to the tumor's tendency to spread around the dura mater. Although the 5-year survival rate is quite good, the 10-year rate is poorer with many patients developing distant metastases. Lung metastases and death are also common in patients who have survived surgery, usually after 5-10 years.; Treatment of adenoid cystic carcinoma: Surgery is often performed to remove the tumor extensively, but it easily causes local recurrence due to the tumor's tendency to spread around the dura mater.
