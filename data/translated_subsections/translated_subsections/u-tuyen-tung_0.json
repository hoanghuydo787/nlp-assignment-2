    "subsection_content": "Nowadays, many people may still feel strange when they hear the word \"pineal gland\". The pineal gland is a small endocrine gland in the skull, located near the center of the brain, and has the function of regulating the body's circadian rhythm (wake-sleep cycle). With its location deep in the brain parenchyma, surrounded by many blood vessels, surgical access to the pineal gland area is always a big challenge for neurosurgeons.\nPineal gland tumors appear in the pineal gland area, including tumors of the pineal gland components and tumors. This tumor has a high possibility of compressing the third ventricle, compressing the cerebral aqueduct and causing hydrocephalus. Not only that, tumors in the pineal gland area also cause compression of the cerebellum, upper brain stem and posterior fossa,... causing many disorders.\nAccording to many medical studies around the world, pineal gland tumors are quite rare. Research results show that the incidence rate is only about 0.4 - 1% in adults and 3 - 8% in children in the Americas and Europe (brain tumors). The disease appears more frequently in Asia with a rate of 3 - 9% (intracranial tumors). (first)",
