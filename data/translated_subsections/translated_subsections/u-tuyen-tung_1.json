    "subsection_content": "Pineal gland tumors are not always diagnosed as cancer. However, even when benign, pineal tumors still cause many problems during development: pressing on other parts of the brain, blocking the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid, increasing intracranial pressure. .\nCommon types of pineal tumors: germ cell tumors, pineal parenchymal tumors, papillary pineal tumors, pineoblastoma, mixed pineal tumors\nPineal gland tumors include the following common types:\nGerm cell tumor\nGerm cell tumors are a group of primary tumors in the brain and are relatively rare. This type of cell tumor usually develops in children between 10 and 12 years old. Germ cell tumors commonly occur mainly in the pineal gland area and the suprasellar fossa area.\nPineal parenchymal tumor\nPineal gland parenchymal tumors include a group of tumors ranging from relatively benign to highly malignant. This is level II or III (intermediate level) and can occur at any age. Because they are intermediate level, these tumors still have a risk of recurrence after being removed.\nPapillary pineal tumor\nPineal papillary tumors (PTPR) occur only in the pineal region and occur most commonly in adults. Short-term headaches are a common symptom of papillary pineal tumors. Papillary tumors of the pineal region recur locally frequently, but occasionally metastasize to the spine. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified them as category II or III.\nCystoma\nPineal blastoma is a type of cancer that starts in the pineal gland. These cells grow rapidly and can invade and destroy healthy body tissues.\nCystoma can occur at any age and occurs most often in young children. Cystoma can cause headaches, drowsiness, and changes in the way the eyes move to become more abnormal.\nPineal gland tumors can be very difficult to treat. They can spread within the brain and into the cerebrospinal fluid. Surgery to remove this tumor is a necessary treatment.\nMixed pineal tumor\nThis is a combination of slow-growing and fast-growing cell types. Level I cells have the slowest growth and level IV cells have the fastest growth.",
