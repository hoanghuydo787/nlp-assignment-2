However, the appearance of brain tumors can be due to the effects of risk factors such as: (2)\nObstruction of gland excretory ducts after traumatic brain injury\nInfection of the nervous system; Vascular diseases; Hormonal imbalance; Echinococcus bacteria eat into body cells.\nOr the cause of this tumor formation may also come from other congenital factors.\nIn addition, each person's body's genes and the impact of the environment are also factors that cause the formation of pineal gland tumors. In some cases, exposure to radiation or other genetic problems can also cause pineal tumors.\nThe causes of pineal tumors in the brain come from many risk and congenital factors",
