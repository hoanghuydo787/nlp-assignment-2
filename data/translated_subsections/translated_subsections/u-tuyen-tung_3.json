    "subsection_content": "Headache and vomiting due to increased intracranial pressure\nAbnormally increased intracranial pressure is a signal of the presence of a tumor that blocks the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. Pineal gland tumors start silently, so sometimes they only cause fairly simple hydrocephalus and are easily confused with other common hydrocephalus diseases. (3)\nTo recognize increased intracranial pressure, do not subjectively ignore the following symptoms: headache, nausea, vomiting,  breathing disorders. These symptoms are very common in diseases such as digestive disorders, food poisoning, etc., so they can cause confusion. If patients have suspicious signs, they need to go to the hospital for a quick health check to help accurately diagnose the condition.\nIncreased cranial pressure signals the presence of a pineal gland tumor\nVision disorders\nAnother recognizable symptom of a pineal gland tumor is blurred vision, difficulty raising the eyes upward, and loss of focus of the two eyeballs (Parinaud's sign). The patient will have signs of difficulty concentrating, mental and personality disorders, gradual loss of coordination and endocrine disorders due to the tumor growing and compressing around the pineal gland area.\nOther clinical symptoms\nChronic headaches are also a symptom of a tumor forming in the pineal gland area. If this tumor is malignant and grows rapidly, the patient will have acute clinical manifestations as well as impaired consciousness or coma.\nSymptoms of pain in the back of the neck and back pain are also manifestations of this malignant tumor following the cerebrospinal fluid moving down the spinal cord. If the pineal gland tumor invades the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, it will cause diabetes insipidus and increase HCG levels. This will cause the patient to reach puberty early (before age 10).\nChronic headaches can also be a symptom of a pineal tumor",
