    "subsection_content": "Whether a pineal gland tumor is dangerous depends on the nature, extent, and location of the tumor. Reality shows that pineal gland tumors are mostly malignant (up to 40%), but most will be sensitive to radiotherapy. Meanwhile, benign pineal gland tumors can be cured with surgery.\nThis shows that pineal gland tumors, whether benign or malignant, have positive treatment options. However, the negative effects of this tumor on the brain are a serious problem. Therefore, to achieve the best treatment results, patients need to proactively seek medical examination promptly to receive treatment as soon as possible.",
