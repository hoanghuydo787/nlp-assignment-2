    "subsection_content": "First, your doctor will ask about your family history and any symptoms you are experiencing. You may also have a neurological exam to check your reflexes, eye movements, motor function, sensation, coordination and balance. If your doctor thinks you may have a pineal gland tumor, he or she may order additional tests, which may include:\nQuantification of AFP, HCG\nIf it is not an emergency, the doctor will not prescribe immediate surgery for a pineal gland tumor. At this time, the patient can undergo quantitative testing of AFP, HCG, and biopsy to be able to locate and determine the nature of the pineal tumor. This will help the doctor determine whether the tumor is benign or malignant.\nQuantifying AFP and HCG concentrations will allow doctors to monitor the effectiveness of treatment (if the treatment is effective, the concentration gradually decreases and is ineffective if the concentration does not decrease or increases). This measurement also allows the treating physician to assess the likelihood of recurrence of the pineal tumor.\nImage analysation\nImaging diagnostics that play the most important role in diagnosing pineal tumors are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT-Scan).\nYou may not know, CT-Scan images have good value in diagnosing pineal gland tumors. Pineal gland tumors often calcify within the tumor and will strongly enhance contrast medium. At the same time, the tumor will compress, causing blockage and dilation of the ventricles.\nMRI images will be valuable in diagnosing as well as predicting anatomical lesions of pineal gland tumors. At the same time, MRI images can also evaluate the size, morphology and level of invasion of the tumor.",
