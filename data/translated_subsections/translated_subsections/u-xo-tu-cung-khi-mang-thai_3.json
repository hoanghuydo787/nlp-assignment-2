    "subsection_content": "The uncomfortable and annoying symptoms of uterine fibroids can vary depending on the location, number and size of the fibroids. Doctor Nguyen Duc Hinh shares some symptoms pregnant women may experience if they have uterine fibroids during pregnancy in each trimester as follows:\n1. In the first 3 months of pregnancy (first trimester)\nAt this stage, uterine fibroids are most likely to appear. Because at this time, the hormones in a woman's body have many changes, especially the increase in the production of the hormone Estrogen, while this is the hormone necessary for fibroids to nourish and develop.\nIf you have fibroids at this stage, pregnant mothers may experience either abdominal pain, abnormal bleeding, or both symptoms. A study of 4,500 pregnant mothers showed that 11% of pregnant mothers with fibroids experienced symptoms of abnormal bleeding, 59% of pregnant mothers only had abdominal pain, and 30% of pregnant mothers had both abdominal pain and bleeding in the second trimester. best.\n2. In the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (second and third trimesters)\nAt this stage, the mother's uterus needs to expand so that the fetus has space to develop, which causes the fibroids to be compressed. This is also the reason why pregnant mothers face many risks such as:\nFeeling pain: When the fibroid compresses or undergoes sterile necrosis, the pregnant mother will feel abdominal cramps. More dangerously, if the tumor increases in size but does not receive enough blood to nourish and grow, the pregnant mother may experience severe abdominal pain, increasing the risk of miscarriage.; Placental abruption: Uterine fibroids are one of the causes that cause the placenta to detach from the uterine wall even though the fetus has not yet been born. At this time, the fetus no longer receives nourishing blood from the mother, and the pregnant mother is at risk of blood loss. It can be said that placental abruption threatens the life of both the pregnant mother and the fetus.; Premature birth: Having uterine fibroids during pregnancy is also one of the causes of premature birth (giving birth before the 37th week of pregnancy) compared to pregnant mothers without fibroids.\nPregnant women with uterine fibroids may experience abdominal cramps throughout the three trimesters of pregnancy\n3. During labor\nMany studies show that pregnant mothers with uterine fibroids are 6 times more likely to have a cesarean section than other pregnant mothers. The reason is that if you give birth normally, the fibroids will reduce the uterine contractility, causing the cervix not to open. Some fibroids in the uterine isthmus can block the birth canal, affecting the passage of the fetus, causing difficulty and slowing down the birth process.\nIn addition, pregnant mothers with fibroids are more likely to give birth to a breech position, which means the fetus is in a breech position, with the fetus's buttocks in the lower part of the uterus. Therefore, obstetricians often prescribe cesarean section to ensure safety in these cases.\nAbout 3 to 6 months after giving birth, these fibroids will gradually decrease in size. Research shows that 70% of women who have given birth have fibroids that shrink more than 50% after giving birth.",
