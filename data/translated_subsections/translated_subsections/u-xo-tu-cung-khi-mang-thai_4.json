    "subsection_content": "Women with uterine fibroids during pregnancy may face the following risks:\n1. Infertility – infertility\nFibroids (especially fibroids located near the endometrium) can change the endometrial layer, causing disadvantages for embryo implantation; or the tumor causes compression, bending the fallopian tubes, blocking the cervix...\nIf uterine fibroids are not treated effectively, they can affect women's fertility and disrupt marital happiness.\n2. Miscarriage\nUterine fibroids are the cause of repeated miscarriages because the endometrial layer does not fully develop and the uterine cavity is compressed. Statistics show that pregnant women with uterine fibroids have a higher risk of miscarriage in the first months of pregnancy than women without fibroids (the miscarriage rate is 7.6% when there are no fibroids, increases to 14% when fibroids are present). In particular, when the fibroid is large or has many fibroids, the risk of miscarriage increases.\n3. Premature birth\nWomen with uterine fibroids often have abnormal fetal position (breech position, transverse position, cephalic position) due to placenta attachment in abnormal positions (placenta previa, placenta accreta), or due to tumors. Compressing the uterine cavity, the risk of premature birth is very high.\n4. Causes difficulty in labor\nThe labor process in pregnant women with uterine fibroids will be very difficult and take longer. At the same time, the risk of needing a cesarean section is also higher than that of pregnant women without fibroids.\nPregnant women with uterine fibroids are 6 times more likely to have a cesarean section than pregnant women without the disease\n5. Postpartum hemorrhage\nUterine fibroids affect the uterus's ability to contract to stop postpartum bleeding. Therefore, fibroids can cause pregnant women to hemorrhage after giving birth. Immediately after giving birth, it is necessary to monitor the pregnant woman very closely to detect bleeding early and treat it promptly.\n6. Postpartum infection\nAfter giving birth, women are at risk of dyshidrosis and postpartum infections. In the case of bleeding during delivery of the placenta, if not detected and treated promptly, it can be life-threatening.\n7. Complications for the fetus\nThe fetus is at risk of malnutrition and low birth weight because the blood that nourishes the fetus is partly divided to feed uterine fibroids.\n“Having uterine fibroids during pregnancy can be dangerous for both the mother and the fetus. Therefore, if a woman is diagnosed with this disease or is preparing to become pregnant, she needs to have her pregnancy closely monitored by a good, experienced obstetrician to ensure a safe pregnancy, for both the pregnant mother and her child. The fetus is healthy,\" Dr. Nguyen Duc Hinh emphasized.",
