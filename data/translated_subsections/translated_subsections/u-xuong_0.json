On the other hand, bone tumors can also be a type of metastatic complication of other musculoskeletal diseases. And in the case of metastatic bone tumors, it is always a malignant tumor, leading to bone cancer.\nThe disease can occur in both children and the elderly. However, the progression of the disease in the two groups was different. In children, most cases of bone tumors are primary, the likelihood of being related to cancer is quite low. In adults, especially older adults, most cancerous bone tumors are metastatic.\nHowever, cases of primary bone tumors leading to cancer are rare. The number of primary osteosarcoma cases that cause cancer accounts for only about 3,900 people per year in the United States, as counted in 2022 by the US MSD Manual.

The condition becomes more serious when the patient simultaneously develops symptoms of swelling at the site of the tumor and fractures bones more easily than usual.",
