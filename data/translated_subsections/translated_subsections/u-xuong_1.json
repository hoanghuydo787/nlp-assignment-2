    "subsection_content": "1. Osteochondroma\nOsteochondroma is the most common type of benign tumor, accounting for about 40% of benign bone tumor cases. Osteochondroma is caused by abnormal growth of cartilage and bone, specifically excessive growth. That's why the disease often occurs in people in the developmental age group, from 13 to 25 years old. Statistics from the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) also conclude that osteochondromas often occur in adolescents and young adults.\nOsteocartilaginous tumors form at the ends of long bones such as the arm or leg bones.\n2. Fibroids do not ossify\nNon-ossifying fibroma is a type of bone tumor, formed by fibrotic lesions of bone with subclinical symptoms of cortical bone resorption with lesions appearing. This is a benign tumor.\nPeople with non-ossifying fibroids will have quite small defects inside the bones. These defects will be filled with fibrous tissue instead of bone tissue like healthy people.\n3. Giant cell tumor\nGiant cell tumor, also known as macrocytoma or osteoclastoma, is one of the most common types of benign tumors. However, the disease can progress to malignant giant cell tumors, so patients need to pay more attention to treatment than other benign bone tumors.\nGiant cell tumors occur at the ends of long bones, commonly the upper end of the tibia, femur, radius and lower end of the sacrum. The disease consists of 3 stages:\nSmall benign tumor, bone cortex is destroyed.; The tumor increases in size, the bone cortex is damaged and thinner than normal; The tumor proliferates significantly, negatively affecting surrounding soft tissue. At the same time, blood vessels also proliferate.\n4. Cartilage\nChondrosarcoma is a condition in which cartilage cysts develop inside the bone marrow. There are types such as chondroblastoma, chondromatosis and endochondroma. Endochondromas commonly occur as benign bone tumors, while chondroblastomas are relatively rare.\nEndochondroma can occur in all ages and subjects. The disease often has no accompanying symptoms, but the growth of the tumor will cause swelling and pain at the site of damage.\nThis is a benign tumor. However, in cases where the patient has many endochondral tumors, especially if soft tissue bleeding occurs, the risk of endochondral cancer is higher than that of others.\n5. Aneurysmal bone cyst\nAneurysmal bone cysts are cystic lesions in the metaphyseal regions of long bones, mostly occurring in people over 25 years of age. Damage from aneurysmal bone cysts can last from weeks to years before diagnosis.\nDamaged bone cysts tend to grow more slowly than normal, and bone swelling occurs.",
