This malignant bone tumor mostly occurs in the knee or shoulder bones and long bone areas. (3)\nPatients have symptoms of swelling and pain around the area with malignant bone tumors, high pain intensity, affecting walking and daily activities.\n2. Ewing's sarcoma\nOsteosarcoma, familial Ewing Sarcoma, is common in adolescents and young adults. However, Ewing's sarcoma can also occur in children over 5 years old. The cancer cells of Ewing's sarcoma originate in the marrow cavities, which are the bone cavities where bone marrow is created. In addition, Ewing's sarcoma can also develop in soft tissues such as fat, muscle and blood vessels.\n3. Chondrosarcoma\nChondrosarcoma, also known as chondrosarcoma, develops from common malignant bone tumors. Chondrosarcoma is a primary cancer that develops and metastasizes, often occurring in the pelvis, hips and shoulders. The disease consists of 3 stages and the risk of metastasis to other organs is quite high.\n4. Cancer metastasizes to bones\nBone metastasis is a form of secondary cancer, occurring in cases where there are cancer cells in other organs.\nThe disease can be a complication from cancers such as:\nKidney cancer; Breast cancer; Prostate cancer; Lung cancer; Thyroid Cancer\n5. Multiple myeloma\nMultiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells that destroys surrounding bones by invading and damaging them. The disease causes fatty lesions in bones, bone fractures, kidney failure or infection.\nCommon symptoms of multiple myeloma are persistent bone pain, especially in the back and chest.",
