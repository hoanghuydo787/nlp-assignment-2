There are many secondary causes of bone tumor development such as radiation therapy, side effects of anti-cancer drugs, history of bone trauma, and genetics.\nWith benign tumors, the tumor appears mostly during the period of peak bone growth. Therefore, the age group at risk of benign bone tumors falls into the group of people between 10 and 20 years old.\nOsteosarcoma or bone cancer can be primary cancer or metastasis. Primary osteosarcoma is caused by the development of a malignant tumor inside the bone, and the direct cause of tumor formation has not yet been determined.\nFor secondary malignant bone tumors, it is also bone cancer caused by metastasis from other diseases such as:\nBreast cancer; Kidney cancer; Lung cancer; Prostate cancer; Thyroid Cancer",
