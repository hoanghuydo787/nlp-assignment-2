If the disease develops complications, the patient will face the risk of disability and loss of limb function. In particular, bone cancer can metastasize throughout the body and destroy normal bone tissue.\nBenign bone tumors hardly cause any worrying complications because the disease itself has no symptoms that are dangerous to the patient's health. However, patients may have weaker bones than usual due to the effects of the tumor.",
