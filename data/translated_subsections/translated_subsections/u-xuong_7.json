However, there are cases where the tumor does not disappear or grows larger.

In addition, the treatment regimen also needs to evaluate the metastatic status of cancer cells and the location of cell growth. The treatment process will be more difficult if the malignant bone tumor has reached the metastatic stage.\nTreatment methods for malignant bone tumors and bone cancer include:\nSurgery completely removes the tumor; Radiation therapy, often combined with surgery to shrink the tumor before surgery. In addition, radiotherapy is also applied to destroy cancer cells; Chemotherapy to kill cancer cells that are growing or have a high likelihood of metastasis; Cryosurgery, removing cancer cells with liquid nitrogen\nIt is important to note some side effects that patients may experience when undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy to treat malignant bone tumors.
