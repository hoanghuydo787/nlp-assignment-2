    "subsection_content": "It's unclear what causes DCIS. DCIS forms when genetic mutations occur in the DNA of milk duct cells. Genetic mutations cause the cells to appear abnormal, but the cells are not yet able to spread out of the milk ducts.\nResearchers don't know exactly what causes the abnormal cell growth that leads to DCIS. Factors that may play a part include lifestyle, environment and genes inherited from your parents.",
