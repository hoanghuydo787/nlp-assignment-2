    "subsection_content": "1. Breast examination\nDuctal carcinoma in situ rarely appears as a lump, however, in some cases, the doctor may feel a small lump in the patient's breast.\n2. Breast ultrasound\nUltrasound is a technique that uses ultrasound waves to recreate the image and structure of the mammary gland, thereby helping to detect abnormalities of this organ. With a breast ultrasound, a technician will place a sound-emitting probe on the breast to perform the examination.\nIf the patient is under 30 years old, the doctor may recommend an ultrasound before a mammogram (mammogram) to evaluate whether the tumor is benign or malignant. On dense breast tissue, ultrasound can help diagnose DCIS early.\n3. Mammography\nDCIS is most often detected through breast cancer screening mammograms. If your mammogram shows clustered or branched microcalcifications that are irregular in shape or size, your radiologist will recommend additional mammograms for diagnosis.\nYou can get a diagnostic mammogram, taken at higher magnification from more angles. This exam evaluates both breasts and looks more closely at these microcalcifications for potential malignancy.\nCalcifications are small calcium deposits in the breast that appear as white spots on mammograms. Large, round, or well-circumscribed calcifications are more likely to be benign. Clusters of small, irregularly shaped microcalcifications suggestive of malignancy. If this breast lesion requires further evaluation, the next step is an ultrasound and breast biopsy.\n4. Screening magnetic resonance imaging shows DCIS\nMagnetic resonance imaging (breast MRI) uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the mammary gland. This is a non-invasive technique that does not use radiation, so it is safe for patients. [2]\nMagnetic resonance imaging helps:\nScreening people at high risk of breast cancer such as carrying BRCA gene mutations and pre-cancerous lesions; Check for abnormalities around the mammary gland.; Monitor cancer recurrence after treatment.\n5. Breast biopsy\nThe doctor uses a hollow needle to remove tissue samples from the suspected area, sometimes guided by ultrasound or mammography (3-dimensional stereotactic biopsy).\nBreast biopsy under 3-dimensional positioning: Breast tissue is pressed tightly between two mammography panels, 3-dimensional positioning determines the exact location for the biopsy. Then, use a core needle with vacuum support to remove some pieces of tissue from the suspected lesion to pathologically determine whether there are abnormal cells and what type.\nDuctal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is considered stage 0. Although it is not dangerous, it requires early treatment.",
