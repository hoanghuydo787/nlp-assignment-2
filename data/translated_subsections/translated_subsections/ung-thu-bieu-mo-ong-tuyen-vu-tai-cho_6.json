Surgery\nIf you are diagnosed with DCIS, one of the first decisions you will have to make is whether to treat it with a lumpectomy or a mastectomy.\nBreast conservation surgery (extensive tumor excision)\nWide tumor excision surgery is surgery to remove the DCIS area and a portion of healthy tissue around the lesion. This procedure allows you to retain as much breast tissue as possible and depends on the amount of tissue removed.\nThe study found that women treated with wide mastectomy had a slightly higher risk of recurrence than women who had mastectomy; however, survival rates between the two groups were very similar.\nMastectomy\nBreast reconstruction to restore the shape of your breasts can be done at the same time or later in the procedure, if you prefer. Most women with DCIS have surgery to remove the tumor. However, mastectomy may be indicated if:\nDCIS is large compared to breast size and wide surgical excision of the tumor does not provide cosmetic results.; There are multiple DCIS lesions (multifocal or multicentric disease), meaning in different quadrants of the breast.; After wide excision of the tumor, if the surgical margin is considered unsafe and there are still abnormal cells, additional tissue needs to be removed.; You cannot have radiotherapy after wide excision of the tumor: (1) the first trimester of pregnancy, (2) you have had previous radiotherapy to the chest or breast (3) you have a disease that is more sensitive to the side effects of radiotherapy such as systemic lupus erythematosus; You prefer a mastectomy rather than a wide excision of the tumor.\nBecause localized DCIS is non-invasive, the risk of axillary lymph node metastasis is very low and there is no need to remove axillary lymph nodes during wide tumor resection surgery. If DCIS has spread beyond the breast or the tumor may have spread beyond the milk ducts, a sentinel lymph node biopsy will assess the risk of axillary lymph node metastasis.\n2. Radiation therapy\nRadiation therapy uses high-energy beams, such as X-rays or protons, to destroy abnormal cells. Radiation therapy after wide excision of the tumor reduces the chance of recurrence or progression to invasive cancer.\nRadiation therapy is often used after wide excision of the tumor. But radiation therapy may not be necessary if you have only a small area of ​​DCIS that is considered low risk and has been safely removed surgically.\n3. Chemotherapy\nChemotherapy is not necessary for ductal carcinoma (DCIS) because the disease is non-invasive. [3]\nRegular breast cancer screening to detect mammary gland abnormalities early.\n4. Hormone therapy (hormones)\nHormone therapy is a treatment that blocks hormones from reaching cancer cells and is only effective for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Adjuvant endocrinology aims to reduce the risk of recurrence of DCIS or invasive breast cancer in both breasts.\nThe drug tamoxifen blocks the action of estrogen - a hormone that fuels some breast cancer cells and promotes tumor growth. Typically used for up to 5 years in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women.\nMenopausal women may also consider hormone therapy with medications called aromatase inhibitors, taken for up to 5 years, which work by reducing the amount of estrogen produced in your body.\nIf you choose a mastectomy, the risk of invasive breast cancer or DCIS recurring in the small amount of remaining breast tissue is very low and the need for supportive hormonal treatment is rare. Any potential benefit from hormone therapy will only apply to the opposite breast.",
