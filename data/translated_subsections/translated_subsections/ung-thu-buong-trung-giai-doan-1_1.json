    "subsection_content": "There are two staging systems for ovarian cancer: the AJCC/UICC staging system and the FIGO staging system. Among them, the FIGO staging system is often used by doctors in clinical practice.\nAccording to the FIGO classification, ovarian cancer is classified into 4 stages (FIGO I to FIGO IV). FIGO I stage ovarian cancer is diagnosed when the tumor is limited to the ovaries or fallopian tubes (also called \"fallopian tubes\"), has not metastasized to regional lymph nodes, and has not metastasized far.\nStage I ovarian cancer will be divided into 3 subgroups (stages IA, IB and IC): (3)\nIA: Tumor is limited to one ovary or fallopian tube; No tumor cells were detected on the ovarian surface, ascitic fluid or abdominal lavage fluid.; IB: Tumor limited to both ovaries or fallopian tubes; No tumor cells were detected on the ovarian surface, in ascites or abdominal lavage fluid.; IC: Tumor in one or both ovaries accompanied by one of the following factors:  Tumor cell seeding during surgery. Rupture of the tumor capsule before surgery or the presence of a tumor on the surface of the ovary or fallopian tube. Detection of tumor cells in ascitic fluid or abdominal lavage fluid.; Tumor cell seeding during surgery; Rupture of the tumor capsule before surgery or tumor seen on the surface of the ovary or fallopian tube.; Detect tumor cells in ascitic fluid or abdominal lavage fluid.",
