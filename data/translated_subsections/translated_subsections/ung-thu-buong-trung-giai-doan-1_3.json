    "subsection_content": "According to studies, stage I ovarian cancer has a successful treatment rate of up to 90%. However, the rate of patients detecting early stage ovarian cancer is very low, only about 25%.\nMSc. Dr. Luu Thao Ngoc said that if detected early, the survival prognosis of ovarian cancer patients over 5 years is very high, up to 90%. However, the treatment results will depend on many factors such as age, general health status, accompanying medical and surgical diseases, pathological classification, etc. Therefore, it can be seen that the prognosis The ability to live more than 5 years in cancer patients is not only based on the stage of disease detection, but also a combination of many other factors.\nAccording to statistics, the 5-year survival rate for ovarian cancer by pathology type is as follows (according to SEER 2011-2017):\nOvarian carcinoma: 49%; Ovarian germ cell tumors: 93%; Ovarian stromal tumors: 90%\nRegarding the question of how long one can live with stage I ovarian cancer, the prognostic factors are only predictive for the patient's reference.",
