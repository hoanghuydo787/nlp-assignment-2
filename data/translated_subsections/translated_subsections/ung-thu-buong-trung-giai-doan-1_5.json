    "subsection_content": "Is stage 1 ovarian cancer curable? MSc. Dr. Luu Thao Ngoc said that in fact, early stage ovarian cancer can be treated successfully with surgery, and in some cases adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated. (5)\nStage I ovarian cancer surgery\nPatients with stage I ovarian cancer are often referred for surgery right from the beginning. The role of surgery is to confirm the diagnosis, assess the level of tumor invasion and maximize tumor damage. Conservative surgery in cases where the patient still wishes to reproduce; or surgery to remove the entire uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes on both sides, the greater omentum under the transverse colon, and the appendix (in cases of mucinous type), evaluating regional lymph nodes to limit the risk of recurrence in this case. In case the patient no longer wishes to have children. As mentioned above, during surgery, the doctor can conduct a frozen biopsy to evaluate the histopathology of the ovarian tumor and choose the optimal surgical method.\nMost stage 1 ovarian cancer can be cured with surgery alone.\nValence\nMSc. Dr. Luu Thao Ngoc said that chemotherapy indications will be based on patient factors, pathology, risks during surgery, etc. Some indications for adjuvant chemotherapy include: cases of stage IC ovarian cancer, high histological grade serous carcinoma...), residual tumor after surgery,...\nManaging patients after treatment:\nAfter completing treatment, patients will be advised to have regular check-ups every 2-4 months for the first 2 years, every 3-6 months for the next 3 years and once a year after 5 years. Examination will help detect recurrence and progression of the disease early so that treatment can be timely. The doctor will conduct a clinical examination and order a number of tests for evaluation (such as tumor biomarker tests, ultrasound, X-ray, computed tomography, etc.).\nGenetic testing to evaluate high-risk genes involved in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer is often indicated for:\nWomen with a family history of having a relative diagnosed with ovarian cancer. The test will serve the disease screening process throughout a woman's life, and advise on monitoring and preventive treatment for high-risk groups. For example, risk-reducing hysterectomy and adnexectomy can be advised for women aged 35-40 with the BRCA1/2 gene mutation based on fertility wishes to help reduce the risk of cancer. breast cancer, ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, primary peritoneal cancer.; Patients who have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Genetic tests can predict response to chemotherapy as well as to specific targeted drugs.\nTo schedule an appointment for examination, screening, consultation and treatment of ovarian cancer at Tam Anh General Hospital, you can contact:\nEarly detection of stage I ovarian cancer helps increase treatment effectiveness, reduce medical costs, increase cure rates and optimize patient survival time.",
