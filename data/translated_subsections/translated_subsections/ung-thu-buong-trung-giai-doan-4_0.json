    "subsection_content": "Stage IV ovarian cancer (final stage) is a phenomenon in which cancer cells originating from the ovaries or fallopian tubes or peritoneum have metastasized to distant organs outside the body's peritoneal cavity (such as liver, lungs, bones,...).

(first)\nStaging of ovarian cancer according to FIGO\nOvarian cancer is a group of malignant diseases with tumor cells originating from the ovaries, fallopian tubes or peritoneum growing into them, and is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancies in women. .

According to SEER 22 data (statistics from 2013-2019), the proportion of patients diagnosed in the distant metastasis stage is up to 55% and the 5-year survival rate is only 31.5%. Therefore, diagnosing the disease at an early stage and treating it promptly is very important.",
