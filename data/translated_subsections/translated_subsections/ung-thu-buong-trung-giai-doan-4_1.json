Luu Thao Ngoc, there are 2 staging systems used in ovarian cancer: the TNM staging system according to AJCC and the FIGO staging system of the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Based on stage classification and other factors on the patient, doctors will choose the most suitable treatment method for the patient as well as give a prognosis of survival. (2)\nAccording to the T, N, M stage classification system in cancer by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) is expressed as follows:\nTumor (T): Location and extent of tumor invasion.; Regional lymph nodes (N): Reflects metastasis to pelvic lymph nodes or para-aortic lymph nodes; Distant metastasis (M): Reflects metastasis to distant organs (such as bones, liver, lungs, etc.).\nAccording to the FIGO staging system, ovarian cancer includes stage I to stage IV:\nStage I (FIGO I): Tumor limited to the ovaries or fallopian tubes; Stage II (FIGO II): The tumor begins to invade organs in the pelvis.; Stage III (FIGO III): Tumor spreads to the peritoneum outside the pelvis or metastasizes to retroperitoneal lymph nodes; Stage IV (FIGO IV): Distant metastases (such as pleural effusion due to metastatic cancer, liver and spleen metastases, etc.).\nStage IV ovarian cancer according to FIGO classification will be divided into IVA and IVB, specifically as follows:\nStage IVA ovarian cancer\nCancer cells are detected in the pleural fluid (malignant pleural effusion).\nOvarian cancer stage IVB\nCancer cells have metastasized to lymph nodes outside the abdomen such as supraclavicular lymph nodes, inguinal lymph nodes, etc. to bones, organs in the body such as liver, spleen, lungs, etc. (3)\nSee more: 4 stages of ovarian cancer: detailed assessment and diagnosis.",
