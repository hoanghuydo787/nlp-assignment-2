A study by the International Federation of Gynecology & Obstetrics and the Joint Committee on Cancer in the United States announced 3 factors necessary to determine the stage of cancer:\nSize of the tumor: Assessing the size of the tumor is very important, in addition to assessing whether the tumor has spread beyond the ovaries and fallopian tubes; Lymph nodes: Evaluate whether regional lymph nodes have metastasized cancer cells or not; Metastasis: Check whether the tumors have metastasized to other organs in the body such as liver, lungs, bones... or not.\nOvarian cancer has 4 main stages\nState 1\nIn stage 1, the tumor is present in one or both ovaries and fallopian tubes, and has not spread to lymph nodes or other areas in the body. However, in a few cases, tumors can develop on the surface of the ovary, or cancer cells can peel off and appear in the abdominal and pelvic fluid.\nStage 1 ovarian cancer has 3 sub-stages, including:\n1a: Tumor present in one ovarian tube or fallopian tube, with intact capsule; 1b: Tumor present in both ovaries or fallopian tubes; 1c: The tumor is present in one or both ovaries and fallopian tubes and has one of the following 3 phenomena: The tissue surrounding the tumor has ruptured during surgery; Tumors on the surface of the ovaries and fallopian tubes; Cancer cells are present in the abdominal or pelvic fluid.\nPhase 2\nEntering stage 2, ovarian cancer has begun to spread to other organs in the pelvic region such as the bladder, uterus, and colorectum, but has not yet spread to lymph nodes and areas outside the pelvis.\nStage 2 ovarian cancer has 2 sub-stages, including:\n2a: The tumor has spread to the uterus or fallopian tubes, but has not spread to lymph nodes or distant locations; 2b: The tumor has spread to pelvic organs such as the bladder or rectum, but has not spread to lymph nodes or distant locations.\nStage 3\nIn stage 3, cancer is present in one or both ovaries, fallopian tubes or peritoneum, with peritoneal metastases outside the pelvis and/or retroperitoneal lymph node metastases.\nStage 3 ovarian cancer has 4 sub-stages, including:\n3a1: Cancer has spread outside the pelvis, to lymph nodes around the peritoneum, but has not spread to further locations; 3a2: Cancer has spread to organs near the pelvis, and cancer cells are present in the abdominal peritoneum.; 3b: Similar to stage 3a1 but the tumors in the peritoneum can be seen with the naked eye, smaller than 2cm in size; 3c: Similar to stage 3a1 but the cancer cells in the peritoneum are larger than 2cm.\nStage 4\nWhen it reaches stage 4, cancer cells are present in the fluid around the lungs, liver, bones, spleen, intestines and more distant lymph nodes.\nStage 4 ovarian cancer has 2 sub-stages, including:\n4a: Cancer is present in the pleural fluid, has not spread to other organs outside the abdomen.; 4b: Cancer has spread to the liver, bones, intestines, spleen and more distant lymph nodes.",
