(4)\n1. Blood test for CA 125\nCA 125 is a protein found on the surface of malignant cancer cells and some benign tissues. Statistics show that about 80% of patients have CA 125 levels higher than normal. However, it should be noted that CA 125 levels are high but not enough to definitively conclude whether a patient has ovarian cancer or not, because other conditions such as endometriosis and appendicitis can still occur. increases CA 125 levels in the blood. Therefore, patients are often prescribed a number of other techniques to increase the accuracy of diagnostic results.\n2. Ultrasound\nYour doctor may prescribe a transvaginal ultrasound with the probe inserted into the vagina, or an extracorporeal ultrasound with the probe placed next to the stomach. Ultrasound images will show the size, structure, and density of the tumor. Does the tumor have walls, papillae, increased blood vessels...\n3. Pelvic examination\nThis test is to determine whether there are any abnormalities in the female genitals (vulva), vagina, uterus and ovaries. The tumor adheres to surrounding organs….\n4. MRI/CT scan\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) will show images of the abdomen, chest and pelvis, combining all to create a clear 3-dimensional (3D) image to help doctors diagnose the disease. Diagnose ovarian cancer and assess the stage of the disease.\nThe latest generation 768-slice magnetic resonance machine system at Tam Anh General Hospital provides clear images of abnormalities inside the body.\n5. Chest X-ray\nA chest X-ray uses a type of radiation to take images of the lungs and pleura. This is a useful technique to help determine whether cancer cells have metastasized to the lungs or not.\n6. Biopsy\nConduct tests on tissue samples to determine the type of malignant cells and the degree of malignant disease, from which the most appropriate treatment method will be selected.",
