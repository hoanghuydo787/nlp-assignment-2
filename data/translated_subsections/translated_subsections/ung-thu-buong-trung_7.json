    "subsection_content": "After receiving the results of a diagnosis of ovarian cancer, depending on the stage of the cancer as well as the patient's health, the level of response to treatment methods and the patient's wishes... the doctor will advise and Prescribe appropriate treatment methods for patients.\n1. Surgery\nThis is the preferred method of choice to treat ovarian cancer patients. Surgery helps determine the exact stage of cancer. During surgery, it can be combined with checking the current condition of the tumor, ovaries and existing lesions inside the abdomen.\nSurgery includes removal of the entire uterus, bilateral adnexa, greater omentum, removal or destruction of all tumors. In addition, the doctor will examine the underside of the diaphragm and the entire peritoneum, then perform a biopsy if any abnormalities are suspected. Next is to check the pelvic and abdominal lymph nodes to remove metastatic lymph nodes. Collect abdominal lavage fluid samples for cytology.\n2. Chemotherapy\nAfter surgical treatment, cancer cells may remain or spread without being completely removed. At this time, cancer chemotherapy is used to destroy those remaining cells.\nTypically, chemotherapy is applied adjuvantly to cases of ovarian cancer in stages 1 and 2 by the following methods:\nIntravenous chemotherapy; Abdominal chemotherapy.\nThis chemical will affect both cancer cells and abnormal cells, so there will be side effects. This side effect will vary depending on the type of drug and dosage. There may be nausea, vomiting, fatigue, loss of appetite, headache, tingling sensation in the hands and feet, and darkened skin. ... When experiencing these symptoms, patients need to notify their doctor for monitoring and specific treatment instructions.\nAdjuvant chemotherapy for stage 3 and 4 cancer is applied using the following methods:\nIntravenous chemotherapy; Combination of intravenous chemotherapy and abdominal chemotherapy.\n3. Radiation therapy\nThis is a method that uses high-energy rays (radiation rays) to destroy cancer cells. Radiation therapy also affects both cancer cells and normal cells, thus reducing side effects. Side effects will depend on the dose of radiation used and the part of the body irradiated.\nSome common side effects are feeling tired, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty urinating, skin changes in the abdominal area... Intraperitoneal radiotherapy can cause abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction.\n4. Targeted therapy\nTargeted therapy is one of the important treatment methods in treating multimodal cancers by focusing on the growth, division and spread of cancer cells. This method will attack and block specific genes or proteins found in cancer cells, or cells involved in the formation and development of tumors.\nIn the treatment of ovarian cancer, it is necessary to biopsy the tumor to do immunohistochemical or molecular biology tests to diagnose the type of ovarian tumor, thereby providing a suitable regimen to choose the appropriate drug.\nTargeted therapy can cause some side effects in patients depending on the drug and the body's response. Patients may experience fatigue, diarrhea, high blood pressure, heart failure, dermatitis, mucositis, bleeding, slow wound healing... A few cases have perforation of the esophagus, intestines, stomach... Most These side effects will disappear when treatment is stopped.\n5. Immunotherapy\nImmunotherapy is a method with many advances, promising a new treatment direction. Immune drugs such as Pembrolizumab, Atezolizumab... are being applied in treatment, bringing many positive results.\n6. Fertility preservation treatment\nOvarian cancer treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy can damage women's reproductive organs, reducing or losing the ability to get pregnant after cancer treatment. Therefore, if the patient still wishes to become pregnant in the future, talk to the doctor before treatment for advice and guidance on fertility preservation methods.\nCurrently, at the Reproductive Support Center, Tam Anh General Hospital, methods to preserve fertility in women include:\nFertility preservation surgery: In some cases, surgery removes only one ovary, keeping the remaining ovary healthy for future pregnancies. This method can only be performed in stage 1 ovarian cancer; Embryo freezing: Freezing fertilized eggs.; Oocyte freezing: Freezing unfertilized eggs.; Ovarian tissue preservation: Freeze ovarian tissue for future use.; Ovarian suppression: Involves taking hormones to temporarily suppress ovarian function.\n7. Appropriate nutrition\nIn addition to complying with the treatment regimen prescribed by the doctor, patients need to have a scientific nutrition plan to improve their medical condition, provide nutrition for a healthy body, and good resistance to prevent disease. prevent disease recurrence.\nBased on the examination process and the patient's wishes, the doctor will prescribe an appropriate treatment regimen\nFruits and vegetables: Fruits and vegetables provide large amounts of beta-carotene and vitamin C, which act as antioxidants, help the body heal quickly, and fight infections and cancer. .; Foods rich in starch: Starch found in rice, cereals, bread, potatoes... will provide glucose which is the necessary energy source that the body needs.; Protein-rich foods: Protein-rich foods such as lean meat, fish, dairy products... will promote strong immune activity.; Beneficial fats: Beneficial fats in foods such as avocado, fish oil, vegetable oil, nuts, etc. will help the body absorb nutrients well, control fatigue in patients. stimulates brain activity...",
