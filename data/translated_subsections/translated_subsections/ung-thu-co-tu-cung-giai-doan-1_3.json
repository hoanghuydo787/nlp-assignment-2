    "subsection_content": "Pap test\nRegular gynecological examinations combined with Pap tests can detect most cases of cervical cancer. A Pap test (or Pap smear) is a method of collecting cells from the cervix, then checking for signs of pre-cancer, cancer or other benign diseases.\nHPV testing\nIf Pap results are abnormal, the patient is often further examined with an HPV test. This is a test to evaluate whether cells from the cervix are infected with HPV or not.\nThe patient lies supine on a gynecological examination table, and an instrument called a speculum is inserted into the vagina (this instrument will open the vagina). The doctor uses a brush-like tool to remove cells or dilate and curettage the cervix to take specimens for Pap tests and HPV tests.\nHPV testing is done if the Pap test is abnormal\nBiopsy\nThe doctor may also examine the cervix and take tissue samples for biopsy when malignant lesions are suspected. Many techniques can be used to obtain specimens, such as needle biopsy or apexification, etc.",
