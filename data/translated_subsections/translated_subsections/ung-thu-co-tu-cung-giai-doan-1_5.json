    "subsection_content": "Surgery is the main treatment for stage I cervical cancer. The choice of surgery will depend on many factors, including the patient's age, stage, and fertility wishes. (3)\nSurgery\nCut the tip of the cervix\nThis method can be prescribed for women with stage IA1 cervical cancer who still wish to have children. The removed tissue and the remaining surrounding tissue of the cervix will be evaluated pathologically. If no cancer cells are left in the cervical tissue, the patient may not need additional treatment. If there are cancer cells in the cut area, in blood vessels or lymph vessels, or the tumor is too large, the patient may need adjuvant treatment.\nCervical resection surgery\nCervicectomy involves removing the cervix, the upper part of the vagina, some structures and tissues around the cervix, and pelvic lymph nodes. This method can be indicated for stage IA2 and stage IB1 cervical cancer with small sizes (less than 2cm) when the patient still wishes to reproduce.\nHysterectomy\nHysterectomy is the removal of the uterus and cervix, including: partial hysterectomy or total hysterectomy, with or without lymph node dissection, total hysterectomy and 2 adnexa (ovaries, fallopian tube), radical hysterectomy.\nTotal hysterectomy is the most common treatment for women with stage I cervical cancer who no longer wish to have children.\nPortal lymph node biopsy\nPortal lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a method of taking lymph node specimens from the nearest lymph node where cancer cells can metastasize, then pathologically evaluating whether that node contains malignant cells. This method helps the surgeon decide the extent of lymph node dissection.\nRadiotherapy\nWhen the patient refuses surgery or cannot have surgery due to many reasons (such as accompanying medical and surgical diseases...), radiotherapy will be a radical treatment method for stage I cervical cancer. In addition, radiotherapy is also used after surgery in cases where there are remaining cancer cells after surgery or cancer cells have invaded blood vessels and lymphatic vessels according to pathology analysis results. (4)\nExternal beam radiation therapy alone or combined with brachytherapy is used to treat cervical cancer. External beam radiation therapy is usually given 5 days a week over a period of 6 to 7 weeks. Brachytherapy may be given in the final weeks of external beam radiotherapy or after external beam radiotherapy has ended.\nValence\nConcurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy will be used if the patient cannot have surgery or refuses surgery. Chemo-radiation therapy is also the main treatment method for cervical cancer stage IB2 or higher. In addition, this method can also be indicated after surgery in cases with high risk factors for recurrence on pathology results (such as remaining cancer cells at the surgical site, in blood vessels or lymph vessels). blood,…).\nChemotherapy treatment of cervical cancer at Tam Anh hospital",
