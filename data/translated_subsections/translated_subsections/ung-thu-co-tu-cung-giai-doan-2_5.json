    "subsection_content": "Doctor Khiem said that commonly chosen treatment methods for stage II cervical cancer include: (4)\nConcurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy (priority).; Surgery.\nChemotherapy and radiotherapy simultaneously\nThis is often the preferred method of choice in treating stage II cervical cancer. Radiation therapy in cervical cancer includes external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy. Doctors often combine these two methods together:\nExternal radiation therapy: A method of emitting radiation beams from a source outside the body (radiation generator) to the tumor. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a technique in external radiation therapy commonly used to treat cervical cancer, bringing good treatment effects as well as reducing unwanted effects.\nBrachytherapy: Also called “internal radiation therapy”, radiotherapy uses a radioactive source placed directly on or near the tumor.; Chemical drugs are used in combination with radiotherapy to increase the effectiveness of treatment. Cisplatin (or carboplatin) is often chosen.\nChemotherapy treatment of cervical cancer at Tam Anh General Hospital, HCM\nSurgery\nSome patients may be referred for surgery during this period. This method includes total hysterectomy, pelvic lymphadenectomy/abdominal para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Based on the postoperative pathology results, the patient may be considered for adjuvant treatment after surgery. The disease has a high risk of recurrence if there is one of the following factors such as: lymph node metastasis, vascular/lymphatic invasion, or residual tumor in the surgical area. If one of the high risk factors is present, the patient will receive adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy after surgery.\nDoctor Khiem advised that stage II cervical cancer is an early stage with a positive prognosis. Timely and correct treatment will give the patient a better chance of living after 5 years. Therefore, patients should go to reputable hospitals that specialize in Oncology, combined with other specialties such as Obstetrics and Gynecology to coordinate and standardize and choose the most optimal treatment methods.",
