    "subsection_content": "The 5-year survival rate in patients with late-stage cervical cancer is very low (about 15% according to SEER).\nThere are many factors that affect the prognosis of patients at this stage such as:\nAge: The older you get, the weaker your resistance and ability to respond to treatment. In elderly patients, there are many factors that predict survival beyond the stage of the disease such as comorbidities, nutritional status, compliance with treatment... Oncologists are always careful in choosing treatment regimen for the elderly patient group, ensuring a balance between treatment effectiveness and safety of the selected method.; General health status, accompanying medical and surgical diseases: The patient's whole body condition, accompanying diseases (such as cardiovascular disease, liver disease, kidney disease, etc.) are also factors that help doctors. Doctors consider choosing treatment regimens. The better the condition, the higher the response rate to treatment and the more improved the prognosis. With late-stage cervical cancer, treatment methods are only aimed at relieving symptoms and prolonging the patient's life. Treatment methods for stage IV are mainly systemic treatments (using chemicals, immunotherapy, targeted drugs, etc.), possibly combined with local treatments (such as symptomatic radiotherapy, etc.) will be considered based on each individual patient. In addition, nutritional issues should also be taken into account. When the disease is in its late stages, patients often show loss of appetite and poor appetite, leading to rapid physical wasting and easily falling into a state of serious malnutrition. A proper nutritional regimen is extremely important.; Treatment methods and treatment response: Not all patients at the same stage are treated with the same regimen, the choice will be based on each individual, as well as the experience of each doctor. clinical. Based on factors such as age, general condition, accompanying diseases, as well as oncological factors (such as pathology, molecular biological characteristics of the tumor, etc.), the patient will receive the most appropriate treatment. However, each patient's response to treatment is not the same. Some patients respond very well, while others do not respond, leading to having to move on to the next treatment steps. Individualizing patients and combining multispecialties will help improve treatment results.",
