Radiation therapy in cervical cancer is a combination of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy. Brachytherapy may be started in the final weeks of external beam radiotherapy or after external beam radiotherapy has finished.\nBefore the 1990s, the standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer was the use of external beam radiation and internal beam radiation therapy, which did not lead to any significant advances in the treatment of cervical cancer. supply for many years. However, recently the addition of concurrent chemotherapy to radiotherapy has improved treatment outcomes in these patients. Chemotherapy with cisplatin or carboplatin helps kill cancer cells and increases the effectiveness of radiotherapy.\nTreatment of stage IVB cervical cancer\nCervical cancer that has metastasized to distant organs will be very difficult to treat. Historically, patients with distant metastatic cervical cancer were considered incurable and rarely survived more than a year or two. Some patients are treated with chemotherapy to prolong life and relieve symptoms caused by advanced cancer.
