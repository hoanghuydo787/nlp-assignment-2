    "subsection_content": "If not detected early and treated promptly, it can progress badly, leading to dangerous complications, threatening the patient's health and life. Dangerous complications such as:\nInfertility: Tumors invade and affect the cervix - where sperm and eggs meet. In some cases, to completely treat the disease and ensure the patient's life, it is necessary to remove the entire uterus and ovaries, which means that women lose their motherhood. In addition, oophorectomy can cause menopause to occur sooner.; Psychophysical effects: The disease causes emotional disorders, in many cases patients suffer from depression, and family happiness is broken; Abnormal bleeding: In case the tumor invades the vagina, or metastasizes to the intestines or bladder, it can cause bleeding and the patient may urinate mixed with blood.; Kidney failure: Some studies show that tumors can squeeze into the ureters, blocking the flow of urine out of the kidneys. When urine accumulates for a long time, it will cause the kidneys to swell, causing kidney scarring and impaired kidney function.\nCervical cancer can lead to infertility, affecting family happiness\n“If cervical malignant tumor is detected early, right from the pre-cancerous stage, the cure rate can be up to more than 90%. In stage I, the successful treatment rate is about 85-90% and gradually decreases in later stages. In stage II, it reduces to 50-75%, in stage III it is 25-40% and in stage IV it is only 15%, the patient's prognosis is only prolonged for 5 years\", MSc. Dinh Thi Hien Le emphasize.",
