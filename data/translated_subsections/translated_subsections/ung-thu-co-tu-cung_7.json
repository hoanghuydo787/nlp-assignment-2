(5)\n1. Colposcopy\nThis diagnostic method is used in cases where the patient has abnormal cervical screening test results, or has one of the symptoms of cervical cancer. The purpose of this method is to detect abnormalities in the patient's cervix.\nThe doctor will use a speculum to open the vagina and use a small microscope with a light to observe the cervix. In case the patient has irregular bleeding, the doctor will order a chlamydia test before colposcopy.\n2. Cervical biopsy\nThe doctor may take a small tissue sample (biopsy) to test and detect cancer cells. This process can cause the patient to have prolonged vaginal bleeding, up to 6 weeks. Patients may also have pain symptoms similar to those during the menstrual cycle.\n“In most cases, abnormalities that are only detected by a certain diagnostic method are not enough to conclude whether the patient has cancer in the cervical region or not. Normally, patients will be assigned to perform some additional gynecological tests\", MSc. Dinh Thi Hien Le added.\n3. Additional tests and diagnostic imaging\nWhen the results of a colposcopy or biopsy show abnormal cells, the patient is at risk of cervical cancer and still needs to perform some additional tests such as:\nPelvic examination: This method is performed after general anesthesia, the doctor will in turn check for cancer cells in the patient's organs such as the uterus, vagina, bladder and rectum.; Blood tests: To evaluate the condition and extent of damage to the patient's liver, kidneys and bone marrow.; Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This method is used in cases where you want to identify tumors, probe the level of invasion and metastasis of abnormal cells.; Chest X-ray: To check if cancer cells have metastasized to the lungs; PET-CT scan: This method is often combined with CT scan to determine whether the cancer has metastasized or not, and to explore the patient's ability to respond to treatment methods.\nFrom the results of paraclinical examination combined with clinical examination, the doctor will make an accurate diagnosis of what stage the cancer is in and recommend treatment methods to avoid dangerous complications.",
