    "subsection_content": "After a general health examination, asking about the patient's medical history and symptoms, doctors often prescribe tests to determine late-stage metastatic stomach cancer.\nTesting methods include: (3)\nBlood tests\nDetect anemia, changes in liver and kidney function; increased concentration of cancer markers...\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy\nThe doctor will insert a thin, flexible tube (called an endoscope) from the throat to the esophagus and stomach for observation. The end of the scope has a small camera attached directly to the external monitor. During scanning, the lesions will be displayed directly on the screen so the doctor can rely on that to detect tumors or lesions suspected of cancer.\nBiopsy\nDuring an endoscopy, the doctor will take a small piece of tissue from the suspected stomach lesion to look at it for signs of cancer cells under a microscope.\nGastric endoscopy diagnoses stomach cancer at Tam Anh General Hospital.\nStomach X-ray with Baryte\nThe patient is given a pastel-colored liquid containing Baryte. This fluid covers the stomach and makes the image of the stomach and abnormal stomach lesions (if any) show up more clearly on X-rays. However, this method is rarely used today, because there are other alternative survey methods.\nCT scan\nChest CT, abdominal CT, brain CT, neck CT, and pelvic CT help survey detailed images of organs inside the body, evaluate invasive organs, and metastasis of stomach cancer.\nBone scan\nBone scans use radioactive isotopes injected into the patient's body, then use recording equipment to capture the radiation and convert it into signals and convert them into images. This helps doctors find lesions in the patient's bones. This is the most useful method to detect bone metastases in cancer.\nPET-CT\nPET/CT helps detect lesions early and assess the stage of the disease, assess recurrence after treatment, and detect metastasis of stomach cancer. PET-CT can provide information about functional abnormalities of organs in the body very early compared to other diagnostic imaging methods.\nLaparoscopic abdominal surgery\nDr. Thao said that peritoneal metastasis is sometimes difficult to determine using conventional imaging techniques. Therefore, the doctor can perform exploratory laparoscopic surgery. This is minimally invasive surgery, through only a few small incisions in the abdominal wall,  helping to accurately diagnose cancer invasion and metastasis to the peritoneum; It is possible to combine peritoneal lavage, fluid collection and suspected lesions on the peritoneum (or in the abdominal cavity) to do cytological testing to find cancer cells. In patients with advanced gastric cancer in whom imaging and other measures fail to diagnose, cytology of peritoneal lavage fluid and biopsy of suspected peritoneal lesions can be very helpful in determining the diagnosis. Determine the level of metastasis of the disease, thereby helping to plan appropriate treatment for the patient.",
