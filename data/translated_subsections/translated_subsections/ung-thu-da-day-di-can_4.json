    "subsection_content": "Dr. Thao said that treating metastatic stomach cancer is much more difficult than in previous stages. Because at this time, cancer cells have metastasized to many other parts and organs throughout the body.\nThe goal of treating metastatic stomach cancer mainly focuses on reducing symptoms and controlling cancer growth to provide the best possible quality of life for the patient. Based on the patient's age, overall health, cancer status, and wishes of the patient and family, the doctor can prescribe or advise the patient to choose the most suitable treatment method. . (4)\nTreatment methods for metastatic stomach cancer include:\nSymptomatic surgery\nIn patients with metastatic stomach cancer who have symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding or gastric outlet obstruction, doctors may perform a gastrectomy or connect the stomach to the small intestine depending on the primary tumor and treatment. Surgical conditions allow.\nIn this surgery, part of the small intestine is attached to the upper part of the stomach, bypassing the tumor and allowing food to flow out of the stomach.\nIn addition, the doctor can place an additional tube from the stomach or small intestine to the skin so that the patient can receive nutrition through this tube. This is a method of opening the stomach or jejunum to the skin for feeding.\nValence\nChemotherapy is a systemic treatment that uses chemicals to help shrink malignant tumors, reduce symptoms caused by cancer, and prolong the patient's life.\nIt is possible to perform single-agent chemotherapy with 1 drug, or choose a combination of drugs such as 5-FluoroUracil (5-FU) combined with Cisplatin (CDDP) (FP regimen), ECX regimen, EOF regimen, EOX gear,…\nPatients who tolerate chemotherapy will have a survival benefit compared with palliative care alone.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiation therapy uses particles or waves of energy to kill or destroy cancer cells. In metastatic stage stomach cancer, radiotherapy can control symptoms in bone metastases and brain metastases.\nTargeted treatment drugs\nTargeted therapy is a method that affects specific molecules necessary for carcinogenesis and tumor development. Two commonly used targeted drugs are monoclonal antibodies and small molecule drugs.\nAppropriate patients receiving this therapy have a greater survival benefit than chemotherapy alone.\nImmunotherapy\nThis is a biological treatment that helps strengthen the immune system (made up of white blood cells and organs and tissues of the lymphatic system) against cancer.\nPembrolizumab (Keytruda) is an immunotherapy drug used to treat stomach cancer that has recurred or metastasized in cases that have not responded to or progressed  on two or more chemotherapy regimens.\nClinical trials\nClinical trials are studies that test the safety and effectiveness of experimental therapies that have not yet been approved by the FDA as treatment regimens. These trials could lead to groundbreaking new treatments that could help patients improve their quality of life and survival rates.",
