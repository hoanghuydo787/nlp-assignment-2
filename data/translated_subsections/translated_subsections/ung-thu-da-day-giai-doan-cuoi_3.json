    "subsection_content": "To diagnose late-stage stomach cancer, your doctor may follow this procedure:\n1. Physical examination and medical history\nYour doctor checks your general health, including checking for signs of illness, such as lumps or any other abnormalities. Besides, the doctor will also learn about the patient's health history as well as past illnesses and treatments that have been performed.\nGeneral health check, personal and family medical history, and tests to diagnose stomach cancer.\n2. Blood test\nThis method measures the amount of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An abnormal reading (higher or lower than the standard) may be a sign of disease.\n3. Complete blood count (CBC)\nBlood samples were taken and tested for the following indicators:\nNumber of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.; Amount of hemoglobin (oxygen transport protein) in red blood cells.; Composition of different types of red blood cells\n4. Gastroesophageal endoscopy\nThis procedure looks inside the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum (first part of the small intestine) to check for abnormal areas. Tam Anh General Hospital uses soft endoscopy techniques that are painless and do not cause discomfort to the patient.\n5. Take barium sulfate\nThe patient drinks a liquid containing barium-sulfate, a silvery-white metallic compound, so that it coats the esophagus and stomach during X-rays. This X-ray image of the esophagus and stomach helps evaluate the upper digestive system.\n6. CT scan (CAT scan)\nThis method helps survey the level of metastasis of stomach cancer to evaluate the stage of the disease and choose treatment methods. In some cases, intravenous or swallowed contrast dye may be used during the scan to make organs or tissues appear more clearly.\n7. Biopsy\nA stomach biopsy is often performed during an endoscopy. The tissue sample can be measured for HER2 gene expression and the HER2 protein produced. If there is expression of multiple HER2 genes or higher than normal levels of HER2 protein, the cancer tissue is said to be HER2 positive. HER2-positive stomach cancer can be treated with monoclonal antibodies that target the HER2 protein.\nThe tissue sample may also be tested for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection.",
