    "subsection_content": "Treatment for late-stage stomach cancer depends on the size of the tumor and its location in the body, the symptoms the patient experiences, and previous treatments.\nTo shrink or slow the growth of cancer and reduce symptoms, your doctor may recommend:\n1. Chemotherapy\nChemotherapy is used during this stage to destroy cancer cells; At the same time, it acts as a therapy to help alleviate symptoms and improve the patient's quality of life.\n2. Radiation therapy\nRadiation therapy uses high-energy waves such as X-rays to kill cancer cells, shrink tumors and help relieve symptoms.\n3. Targeted treatment drugs\nTargeted drugs are treatments that change the way cells work and help the body control the spread of cancer. They work by \"targeting\" spots that help cancer cells survive and grow to limit replication, inactivate or kill malignant cells.\nYou may be given targeted cancer drugs combined with chemotherapy if your advanced stomach cancer is HER2 positive. HER2 stands for epidermal growth factor receptor. It is a protein that stimulates cells to grow and divide.\n4. Other treatment methods\nLate-stage stomach cancer can cause narrowing or obstruction of the upper digestive tract, causing pain, weakness and exhaustion.\nDoctors can apply the following methods to improve patients' symptoms:\nLaser therapy: Uses hot light beams to burn away obstructive cancer cells.; Stent placement: A stent is inserted to help expand the patient's stomach so that food can flow completely into the intestines.",
