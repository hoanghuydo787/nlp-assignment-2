Abnormal changes/developments originate from a few cells and can gradually progress to form a warty or ulcer-like cancerous lesion. This process can take at least several months or several years. Therefore, in the early stages of tumor formation, if not screened early, the disease will not be detected. The disease can affect any part of the stomach, but most commonly the main part of the stomach (gastric body) and the intersection of the stomach and esophagus (the esophagus is the tube that carries food from the mouth). into the stomach).\nStomach cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women worldwide. The disease causes a high mortality rate but is difficult to diagnose because it often does not show symptoms in the early stages.\nBased on the level of damage, stomach cancer is divided into 5 stages, including:\nStage 0: New cancer cells appear in the stomach lining. This is also known as carcinoma, which is an early stage of stomach cancer.; Stage 1: Cancer cells have caused damage to the second layer of the stomach; Stage 2: Cancer cells have invaded through the stomach lining. This stage is also known as submuscular cancer; Stage 3: Cancer cells have grown into lymph nodes and other organs in the body.; Stage 4: At this final stage, cancer cells have metastasized throughout the body, causing a high risk of death.",
