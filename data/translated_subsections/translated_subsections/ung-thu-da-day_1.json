    "subsection_content": "The stomach is a J-shaped organ, located in the upper abdomen, part of the digestive system. When a malignant lesion forms in the stomach, depending on the stage of the disease and the location of the lesion, the patient may have different signs. However, in general, these signs are often quite vague and not specific to stomach cancer (because these signs can also appear in other benign diseases of the stomach). Signs may include:\nFirst stage: Usually divided into 2 main groups\nDigestive disorders: Difficulty swallowing; Belching, belching, heartburn; Feeling of nausea, vomiting; Pain: Dull, non-cyclical pain; Pain when hungry; Pain under the sternum when eating a full meal.\nSymptoms of early-stage stomach cancer are very difficult to detect and are easily confused with signs of gastritis\n“Due to their non-specific and vague nature, these symptoms are easily confused with stomach ulcers, so patients often subjectively do not screen for the disease early. This is also the reason stomach cancer is often detected late, when it is already in an advanced and/or metastatic stage.\" – Doctor Tran Vuong Thao Nghi emphasized.\nProgressive stage: Also divided into groups as follows\nGastrointestinal disorders: Nausea and vomiting; Frequent heartburn; Constant bloating; Eating a little makes you feel full; Anorexia.; Pain: Often has severe pain after eating; Or dull, non-cyclical pain; Pain when hungry; Pain under the sternum when full; Bleeding in cancerous lesions of the stomach: Anemia; Bloody stools or black stools; Yellow skin.; Nutritional disorders due to malabsorption/absorption: Sudden weight loss, unknown reason; Dizziness; Fatigue to the point of reduced ability to work.",
