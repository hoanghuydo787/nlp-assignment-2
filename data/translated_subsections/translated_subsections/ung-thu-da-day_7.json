Because when entering the stomach, these substances will combine into toxins that pose a risk of cancer.; Do not smoke, drink alcohol or use stimulants; Limit industrial food and bottled soft drinks; Proactively screen for early stomach cancer in cases with risk factors.\nAlthough the common age for stomach cancer is 50 years old or older, in recent years, this disease is trending younger and more common in people under 40 years old. However, if detected early from the onset stage, the chance of successful treatment is high, with a survival rate of over 5 years of up to 90%. Therefore, people should improve prevention and screening for stomach cancer early to avoid unfortunate risks caused by this dangerous disease.",
