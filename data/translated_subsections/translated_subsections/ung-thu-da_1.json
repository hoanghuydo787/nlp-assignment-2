    "subsection_content": "There are many layers of skin but the epidermis (upper or outer layer) and dermis (lower or inner layer) are the two main layers. The epidermis is made up of 3 types of cells. (2)\nSquamous cells: are very thin and flat layers that form the top layer of the epidermis.; Basal cells: are round-shaped layers located below squamous cells; Melanocytes: These are cells that produce melanin, located in the lower part of the epidermis. Melanin is the pigment that gives skin its different colors. Melanocytes will produce more pigment when exposed to sunlight. The more pigment, the darker the skin.\nDoctor Ngo Truong Son, Deputy Head of Oncology Department, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, said that which layer of skin cancer starts in will be named after that layer of skin. There are two types of skin cancer: non-melanoma skin cancer and melanoma skin cancer.\nNon-melanoma skin cancer\nNon-melanoma skin cancer is a type of skin cancer that is not malignant melanoma. Non-melanoma skin cancer includes squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma. (3)\nSquamous cell carcinoma: Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that affects the cells located on the outermost layer of the epidermis, or mucous membranes, or the lungs. When cancer forms on the skin, it is called squamous cell skin cancer.; Basal cell carcinoma: A type of cancer that begins in the basal cells of the skin.\nSquamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma are the two most common types of skin cancer, originating in the basal and squamous layers of the skin, respectively.\nThis type of cancer is rarely fatal, but surgical treatment often causes pain and disfigurement of the skin surface.\nNon-melanoma skin cancer most often occurs on parts of the body that are exposed to the sun such as the ears, face, neck and arms. This suggests that long-term, repeated exposure to UV radiation is a major causative factor.\nIn some countries, a clear relationship can be seen between increasing incidence of malignant non-melanoma skin cancer, i.e. higher levels of UV radiation.\nMalignant melanoma skin cancer\nThis type of skin cancer begins in melanocytes. Of all types of skin cancer, melanoma causes the most deaths because it tends to spread to other parts of the body, including vital organs. (4)\nDiagnosis of this type of cancer is likely to be more accurate than that of non-melanoma skin cancer.\nMany studies indicate that the risk of melanoma correlates with genetic and individual characteristics as well as behavioral UV exposure.\nOther less common types of skin cancer\nMerkel cell skin cancer: This type of cancer is formed due to the overgrowth of Merkel cells. This type of cancer is rare and very dangerous, because the rate of metastasis is very fast.; Cutaneous lymphoma: Cancer that forms when white blood cells in the skin grow abnormally. White blood cells function to protect the body from infection and disease and are part of the immune system.; Kaposi sarcoma: This is a malignant skin tumor that shows almost no symptoms in the early stages. When metastasized, it can cause brown, red, or purple tumors or patches of skin. Symptoms often appear on the face, limbs or genitals and lymph nodes.; Actinic keratosis: Is a type of skin pre-cancer of the squamous cell epithelial type. Can progress to malignancy if not promptly intervened and managed. Small patches of skin that are pink, red or brown are common symptoms of skin cancer.",
