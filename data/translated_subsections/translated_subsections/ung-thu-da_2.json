According to Dr. Ngo Truong Son, CKII, skin cancer often has no symptoms in the early stages, although symptoms can appear at any time.\nSkin cancer symptoms may include: (5)\nNew skin lesions or changes in size, shape or color. These changes can vary so much that there is no way to describe what skin cancer looks like;; Itchy or painful;; Ulcers that do not heal but bleed or develop scabs;; The top of the skin appears as a shiny red or skin-colored bump;; Red, rough or scaly spots that can be felt on the skin;; The tumor has a raised border and a central crust or bleeding;; Wart-like spots appear on the skin;; The skin appears as a scar-like streak without clear borders.\nWart-like spots appear on the skin\nAdditionally, skin cancer symptoms can vary depending on the type of skin cancer and its location on the skin. Below are general descriptions of the various symptoms associated with specific types of skin cancer.\nSymptoms of basal cell carcinoma\nSkin cancer often appears on the face, neck, arms, legs, ears and hands. These are areas that are heavily exposed to the sun. However, it can also appear in other areas.\nSigns of basal cell carcinoma may include:\nPearly or waxy bumps on the skin;; Flat, rough, or scar-like patches on the skin;; The ulcer bleeds, does not heal completely, or recurs.\nSymptoms of squamous cell carcinoma\nThis type of skin cancer also tends to develop in areas exposed to the sun. In some cases, squamous cell carcinoma can affect areas that are not exposed to sunlight. This is especially true for people with darker skin tones.\nSigns of squamous cell carcinoma may include:\nA hard, red nodule;; Lesions have scales or irregular borders;; Painful or itchy skin lesions.\nSymptoms of malignant melanoma\nMalignant melanoma can occur anywhere on the body and can develop from a mole. In people with darker skin tones, malignant melanoma tends to appear on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet.\nSigns of malignant melanoma often include:\nChange in appearance of mole;; Develop large brown spots, often with irregular edges;; Dark lesions on mucous membranes (nose, mouth, vagina or anus) or fingers and toes.\nSee more: Images of skin cancer are easy to recognize, don't be subjective with the signs.",
