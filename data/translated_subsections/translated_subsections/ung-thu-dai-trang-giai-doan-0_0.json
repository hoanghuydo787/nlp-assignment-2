    "subsection_content": "Stage 0 colon cancer is very early stage cancer. Cancer cells are found only in the inner lining of the colon or rectum wall (new tumor cells develop in the mucosa layer that has not invaded the basement membrane). It is also known as carcinoma in situ or intramucosal carcinoma (Tis). (first)\nCancer cells can develop from the colorectal lining, on polyps or adenomas. Tumors at this stage have not broken through a protective membrane called the basement membrane, so there is no lymph node metastasis or distant metastases to other organs in the body, so the treatment is extremely effective, with a cure rate. up to nearly 100%.\nStage 0 colon cancer can be cured, treated highly effectively, and is less expensive than late stages.",
