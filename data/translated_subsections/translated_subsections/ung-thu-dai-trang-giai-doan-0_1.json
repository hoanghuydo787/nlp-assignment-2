    "subsection_content": "Colon cancer is classified using a system called TNM, which is based on three factors: (2)\nSize of the primary tumor (T) and degree of invasion into the colorectal wall or adjacent organs; Whether the cancer has metastasized to regional lymph nodes (N).; Whether the cancer has metastasized (M) to distant organs: One or more organs or peritoneal spread.\nThus, stage 0 colon cancer is cancer in situ, in the mucosa layer that has not yet developed, broken the basement membrane or invaded other layers of the colon, and is classified as TisN0M0.\nSee more:\nColon cancer stage 1; Colon cancer stage 2; Stage 3 colon cancer; Stage 4 colon cancer",
