    "subsection_content": "In addition to a physical examination, personal and family medical history, and symptoms, the doctor may prescribe the following paraclinical tests to help diagnose colon cancer. (3)\ncolonoscopy\nThis is the most commonly used and effective functional exploration tool in diagnosing colon cancer. This method allows doctors to determine the location, quantity, morphology, and size of the tumor and take a part of the tumor for histological examination. Tam Anh General Hospital is equipped with a Fuji 7000 endoscopy system (Japan) with an endoscope equipped with the latest imaging technology, capable of magnifying up to 140 times to help observe all lesions in the digestive tract. , including small lesions in the early stages. By acquiring images of the entire colon, the tumor detection rate with sensitivity and specificity is up to 92-97%.\nScreening colonoscopy helps detect colon cancer early and treat it effectively.\nBlood tests\nSerum CEA antigen levels are elevated in 70% of colon cancer patients, but this test is not specific and is therefore not recommended for screening the disease. However, if CEA levels are high before surgery and low after colon tumor resection, monitoring these levels may help detect recurrence earlier. In addition, the tumor marker CA 19-9 is also used in colorectal cancer. The value of tumor markers helps treating doctors evaluate results, monitor recurrence and predict disease prognosis.\nGenetic analysis\nColon tumors removed during surgery are analyzed for associated genetic mutations. Patients with a family history of colorectal, ovarian, and endometrial cancers, especially at a young age, should be tested to rule out Lynch syndrome. Tests to determine gene mutations such as KRAS, NRAS, BRAF are also routinely prescribed to provide the best treatment regimen as well as disease prognosis.\nDiagnostic imaging includes: CT scan, MRI, PET/CT\nCT and MRI scans help evaluate disease stage, tumor status, invasion level, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis to other organs in the body; From there, doctors will recommend the most suitable treatment method.\nPET/CT is one of the accurate staging tools, especially identifying lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis.\nTest to find hidden blood in stool\nThis is a simple, inexpensive and non-invasive diagnostic test. Testing showing hemoglobin in the stool would indicate bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract. However, blood in the stool is a non-specific indicator of colon cancer because it can originate from non-cancerous changes such as polyps larger than 1-2 cm, ulcerative colitis. , stomach ulcers,…\nPatients with a positive fecal occult blood test should undergo colorectal, esophageal-stomach-duodenal endoscopy. If there is a lesion seen during examination, excision or biopsy for pathology is extremely necessary. If the lesion is sessile or cannot be completely removed through colonoscopy, doctors will consider surgery.\nFIT test\nFecal occult blood immunoassay (FIT): The test uses a specific protein that acts as an antibody to find and bind to hemoglobin in stool. This test is often used in colorectal cancer screening.\nSee more: 5 stages of colon cancer: How to evaluate and diagnose in detail.",
