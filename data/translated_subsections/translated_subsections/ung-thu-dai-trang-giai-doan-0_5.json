    "subsection_content": "Because stage 0 colon cancer has not grown beyond the colon lining, surgery is often the only treatment. (4)\nIn most cases, surgery can be performed by removing the polyp or performing a colonoscopic resection (local excision).\nSimple polypectomy (as above) or endoscopic mucosal resection (Mucosectomy) if sm1/2, G1,2; or wedge resection to enlarge the lesion; Cut the connecting colon immediately if the lesion is widely removed and it is not certain that the entire lesion has been removed or the resection area is (+).\nCommon side effects of surgery are pain and discomfort in the surgical area, which can cause digestive disorders, but usually go away after a while. Patients need to adjust their diet and exercise their bowel function after surgery.\nDuring the initial period after surgery, patients need to limit fiber intake because it will make diarrhea more severe. After surgery is stable, patients can increase the amount of fiber in their diet again.\nIn addition, when suffering from colon cancer, patients need to avoid eating fermented foods such as melons, eggplants, shrimp, and sour fish; Limit salty foods; Do not drink soft drinks, beer, wine, etc.\nAfter surgery, patients need to continue regular examinations and tests to manage cancer and prevent the risk of recurrence.\nAfter surgical resection of colorectal cancer, screening colonoscopy should be performed within 1 year after surgery. The second screening colonoscopy should be performed every 3 years.\nMonitoring and early detection of disease recurrence includes history taking, clinical examination and assessment of serum CEA levels every 3-6 months for the first 2 years and then every 6 months for the next 3-5 years. . Imaging studies (CT or MRI) are usually recommended once a year, especially in cases of abnormalities on physical examination or blood tests.\nRegular health checks and proactive cancer screening when risk factors are present are the best ways to prevent colon cancer.\nStage 0 colon cancer is considered the local stage of cancer, with the highest cure rate. At this stage, the disease often does not have any warning symptoms, so the only way to detect the disease early is regular screening. Doctor Khiem recommends performing health checks twice a year and screening for colon cancer from age 45 and older. You can especially start screening for the disease at a younger age for high-risk groups.",
