    "subsection_content": "Colorectal cancer may not cause symptoms right away. In fact, many symptoms of colorectal cancer can also be caused by other problems, such as infection, hemorrhoids, irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease. It is important for patients to check periodically or check immediately if they experience any digestive problems such as: abdominal pain, mucous stools mixed with blood.\nStage 1 colon cancer symptoms are often asymptomatic or have unclear, vague symptoms. If so, it may include:\nChanges in bowel habits, such as diarrhea or constipation lasting more than a few days.; Flat feces shaped like rice leaves; Feeling of incomplete defecation; Rectal bleeding with bright red blood or bloody mucus; Black stool due to gastrointestinal bleeding; Abdominal cramps or pain; Weakness and fatigue; Unintended weight loss can also be a symptom of stage 1 colon cancer.\nDr. Trung said that stage 1 colon cancer symptoms are often unclear, only when the cancer spreads do the above recognizable symptoms appear. That's why it's best for us to have regular check-ups to screen and detect colorectal cancer early before there are any symptoms. Colorectal cancer detected early through screening, before symptoms appear, can be treated more easily and effectively. Screening also helps detect and treat pre-cancerous tumors such as polyps to prevent some gastrointestinal cancers, including colorectal cancer.",
