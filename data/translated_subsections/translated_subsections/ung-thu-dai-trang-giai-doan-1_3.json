    "subsection_content": "If there are symptoms that suggest a person may have colon cancer, the doctor will review the patient's medical history and perform a physical exam. The doctor may also ask the patient to do laboratory diagnostic methods.\nParaclinical methods for diagnosing colon cancer include:\nColonoscopy and biopsy\nIf the doctor suspects signs of colorectal cancer, the patient will have an endoscopy and a biopsy sample taken to check. In this method, the doctor will remove a small piece of tissue with a special instrument. Then, pathology of that tissue sample is performed to determine whether there are  abnormal cells or not. (first)\nCT and MRI\nDoctors may recommend CT and MRI scans to determine the stage of the cancer and see if the disease has spread to other organs.\nEndoscopic ultrasound\nThe doctor prescribes endoscopic ultrasound (Endoscopy combined with ultrasound in the colorectal lumen) to assess the level of invasion of the tumor (T), thereby assessing whether the disease is stage 1 or not.\nGenetic testing\nColon cancer may be related to certain genetic mutations that cause normal cells to become cancerous. These changes in genes are called somatic mutations. They are found only in cancer cells and not in normal cells, so they cannot be passed on to offspring.\nFor some advanced cancers, doctors will do molecular testing on a tumor to look for Somatic mutations. These mutations can predict how tumors respond to treatments. Understanding the genetic makeup of the tumor will help doctors choose more effective treatment methods.\nIf the cancer has spread beyond the colorectal, the doctor will test the biopsy sample to find common gene mutations in colon cancer such as EGFR, KRAS; NRAS; BRAF; MSI; HER 2- Neu. In addition, your doctor will also test for mutations in less common genes.\nPainless colonoscopy helps screen for early-stage colon cancer at Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City",
