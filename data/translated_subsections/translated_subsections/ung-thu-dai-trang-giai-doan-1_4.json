    "subsection_content": "Stage 1 colon cancers have grown deeper into the layers of the colon wall, but they have not spread outside the colon wall or invaded nearby lymph nodes.\nStage 1 cancer includes part of a polyp or in situ cancers. If the polyp is completely removed during a colonoscopy and there are no cancer cells at the edges (margins) of the piece removed, additional treatment may not be needed. (2)\nIf the cancer in the polyp is high-risk or there are cancer cells at the edges of the polyp, surgery may be more likely to be recommended. You may also be advised to have further surgery if the polyp cannot be completely removed or if many pieces have to be removed, making it difficult to identify cancerous cells.\nFor cancers that are not polyps or where the degree of invasion is difficult to assess, surgical removal of part of the cancerous colon and dissection of nearby lymph nodes (regional lymph nodes) is the standard treatment. . In this case, the patient will usually no longer need adjuvant treatment.",
