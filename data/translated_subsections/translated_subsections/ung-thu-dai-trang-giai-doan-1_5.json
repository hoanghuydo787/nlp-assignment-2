    "subsection_content": "According to data from the American Cancer Society, the overall 5-year survival rate of colon cancer is 67%. However, this rate can change based on a number of factors such as the patient's health at the time of diagnosis, ability to respond to treatments, age,... especially the stage of cancer. Colon.\nIf colon cancer is diagnosed in the localized stage, the 5-year survival rate is 90%. The 5-year survival rate is 17% if colon cancer has spread to surrounding tissues or organs and/or regional lymph nodes. In cases where cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, the 5-year survival rate is 17%. (3)\nStage 1 colon cancer is localized, so the 5-year survival rate is 90%. Thus, the prognosis of stage 1 colon cancer is very good, with a high chance of cure. Therefore, screening and detecting the disease at an early stage helps treat it effectively and improve the quality of life for patients.",
