    "subsection_content": "The TNM staging system stands for Tumor, Nodes, Distant Metastases. Where T (Tumor) describes the size of the tumor; N (Node) is whether cancer cells enter the lymph nodes or not; M (Metastasis) describes whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\nAccording to the TNM system, stage 2 colon cancer is divided into 3 stages: 2A, 2B and 2C. (first)\nStage 2A colon cancer (T3, N0, M0)\nCancer has grown into the outermost layers of the colon or rectum but not through them (T3).; It has not invaded neighboring organs.; It has not spread to nearby lymph nodes (N0) and has not spread to distant locations (M0).\nStage 2B colon cancer (T4a, N0, M0)\nThe cancer has grown through the wall of the colon or rectum but has not invaded other nearby tissues or organs (T4a).; It has not yet spread to nearby lymph nodes (N0) and has not metastasized to distant sites (M0).\nStage 2C colon cancer (T4b, N0, M0)\nCancer has grown through the wall of the colon or rectum and is attached to or growing into other nearby tissues or organs (T4b).; It has not yet spread to nearby lymph nodes (N0) and has not metastasized to distant sites (M0).\nSee more:\nColon cancer stage 0; Colon cancer stage 1; Stage 3 colon cancer; Stage 4 colon cancer",
