    "subsection_content": "According to the UK Cancer Research and Awareness Charity (cancerresearchuk), the 5-year survival rate for stage 2 colon cancer patients is more than 80%.\nFactors that affect the prognosis of cancer patients include:\nThe stage of the cancer at the time of diagnosis. This means how big the tumor is and whether it has spread to nearby areas.; The type of cancer and the degree of differentiation of the cancer cells can also affect survival rates. This means how abnormal the cells look under the microscope.; The patient's general and physical health also affects survival. The healthier a patient is, the better able they are to cope with cancer and treatment.; Some bowel cancers make a protein called carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). People with high CEA levels before treatment may have a poorer prognosis.; Colon cancer can sometimes cause a blockage of the intestines (ileus). If this happens, the patient is at risk of perforation of the intestinal wall. Bowel cancer patients with bowel obstruction or perforation have a poorer prognosis.\nSee more: 5 stages of colon cancer: How to evaluate and diagnose in detail.",
