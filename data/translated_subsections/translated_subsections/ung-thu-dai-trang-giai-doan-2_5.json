    "subsection_content": "With stage 2 colon cancer, many patients have developed cancer through the colon wall or into nearby tissue, but not to lymph nodes.\nFor this stage, surgery to remove the part of the colon containing the cancer along with nearby lymph nodes is often the main treatment method. Some people may need adjuvant chemotherapy. (3)\nSurgical methods for stage 2 colon cancer\nOpen surgery\nThe stoma is an open incision in the abdominal wall. Through this opening, the surgeon will cut the colon and remove regional lymph nodes.\nEndoscopic\nSurgeons can remove some localized cancers with this procedure by inserting a thin, flexible tube with a light and camera attached. It will also have accompanying media to remove cancerous tissue.\nEndoscopic surgery\nThe surgeon will make several small incisions in the abdomen. This may be an option to remove the cancer and regional lymph nodes.\nPalliative surgery\nThe purpose of this type of surgery is to relieve symptoms in cases where the cancer cannot be treated or the cancer is advanced. The surgeon will attempt to relieve any blockage of the colon and control pain, bleeding, and other symptoms.\nAdjuvant chemotherapy\nFor cancer cases with a high risk of recurrence, doctors may prescribe adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery to prevent this risk.\nSubjects at high risk of cancer recurrence include:\nPoorly differentiated cell type; But in fact, this is the type with a high risk of recurrence; The cancer has invaded nearby blood vessels or lymph vessels; Not enough 12 regional lymph nodes were removed; The cut area still has tumor cells (macroscopic or microscopic); The cancer has blocked the colon (intestinal obstruction); Cancer perforates the colon wall.\nChemotherapy targets any cells that are dividing rapidly, including healthy cells. They can usually recover from any damage caused by chemotherapy, but cancer cells cannot. The medication travels throughout the body and treatment will occur in cycles, so the body has time to heal between infusions.\nIn addition, adjuvant chemotherapy may also be based on the results of testing the tumor for specific gene changes, known as MSI or MMR.\nAdjuvant chemotherapy can cause side effects and risks. The doctor will consider the benefits of reducing the risk of cancer recurrence and the health side effects of this method to decide whether adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended after surgery or not. Therefore, patients need to discuss with their doctors to clearly understand the purpose as well as the benefits and risks of adjuvant chemotherapy. Side effects of chemotherapy often include: Hair loss, nausea, fatigue, vomiting.\nPatients should go to reputable hospitals with specialties in Oncology, Gastroenterology, and Nutrition to coordinate consultations and come up with individualized treatment regimens to optimize treatment effectiveness.\nStage 2 colon cancer has a good prognosis and high cure rate. It is important that patients need to go to reputable hospitals with multi-specialty coordination on Oncology, Gastroenterology, Nutrition... to coordinate consultations and come up with individualized treatment regimens to optimize effectiveness. treatment results, increased survival rate after 5 years and better quality of life.",
