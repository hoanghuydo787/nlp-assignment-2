    "subsection_content": "The most commonly used colon cancer classification system in the world is the AJCC (The American Joint Committee on Cancer) classification system. The latest classification system is the 8th revised classification system in 2017. In the staging system, colon cancer is classified according to T, N, M, specifically: (2)\nT (tumor) is a tumor, classified into T1 (tumor invades the submucosa), T2 (tumor invades the muscle layer), T3 (tumor invades through the muscle layer to the serosa) and T4 (tumor invades adjacent organs and/perforates visceral peritoneum).; N (nodal) is the metastatic lymph node around the tumor, divided into N1 (when there is metastasis to 1-3 regional lymph nodes), in which N1a - metastasis to 1 lymph node, N1b - metastasis to 2-3 lymph nodes, N1 - metastasis to 1 lymph node. Nuclear deposits in the mesentery of the colon; N2 (metastasis to 4 or more regional lymph nodes) in which N2a - metastasis to 4-6 lymph nodes, N2b metastasis to 7 lymph nodes or more.; M (metastasis) is distant metastasis: M0 means there is no distant metastasis and M1 means there has been distant metastasis to other organs.\nWhen evaluating the patient as a whole or after surgery to remove the tumor, the doctor will determine T, N, M and stage the disease for colon cancer patients.\nStage 3 colon cancer is the stage where the tumor has metastasized into the lymph nodes next to the tumor and has not metastasized far.\nStage 3 colon cancer is divided into the following stages:\nStage 3A colon cancer\nStage 3A (T1 or T2, N1/N1c, M0): Cancer has grown through the mucosa into the submucosa (T1) and it may also have grown into the muscle layer (T2). It has spread to 1-3 nearby lymph nodes (N1) or into fatty areas near the lymph nodes but not the nodes themselves (N1c). At this stage, the cancer has not metastasized to other organs (M0).\nStage 3A (T1, N2a, M0): Cancer has grown through the mucosa into the submucosa (T1). It has spread to 4-6 nearby lymph nodes (N2a). There has been no metastasis to other organs (M0).\nStage 3B colon cancer\nStage 3B (T3 or T4a, N1/N1c, M0): Cancer has grown into the serosal layer of the colon (T3) or perforated the visceral peritoneum (T4a) but has not reached nearby organs. It has spread to 1-3 nearby lymph nodes (N1a or N1b) or into fatty areas near the lymph nodes but not the nodes themselves (N1c). The cancer has not metastasized to other organs (M0).\nStage 3B (T2 or T3, N2a, M0): Cancer has grown into the muscle layer (T2) or into the serosal layer of the colon (T3). It has spread to 4-6 nearby lymph nodes (N2a). The cancer has not metastasized to other organs (M0).\nStage 3B (T1 or T2, N2b, M0): Cancer has grown through the mucosa into the submucosa (T1). It may also have developed into the muscle layer (T2). It has spread to 7 or more nearby lymph nodes (N2b) but has not metastasized to other organs (M0).\nStage 3C colon cancer\nStage 3C (T4a, N2a, M0): Cancer has grown through the colon wall (including the visceral peritoneum) but has not reached nearby organs (T4a). It has spread to 4-6 nearby lymph nodes (N2a) and has not metastasized to other organs (M0).\nStage 3C (T3 or T4a, N2b, M0): Cancer has grown into the serosal layer of the colon (T3) or perforated the visceral peritoneum (T4a) but has not reached nearby organs. It has spread to 7 or more nearby lymph nodes (N2b). At this stage, the cancer has not metastasized to other organs (M0).\nStage 3C (T4b, N1 or N2, M0): Cancer has grown through the colon wall and invaded nearby organs (T4b). It has spread to at least one nearby lymph node or into fatty areas near the lymph node (N1 or N2). The cancer has not metastasized to other organs (M0).\nSee more:\nColon cancer stage 0; Colon cancer stage 1; Colon cancer stage 2; Stage 4 colon cancer",
