    "subsection_content": "Symptoms of stage 3 colon cancer are often clearer and easier to recognize than stages 1 and 2, and may include:\nA tumor in the colon can cause a blockage, narrowing the intestine. Eventually, as the tumor continues to grow, it causes partial obstruction (semi-obstruction) or complete intestinal obstruction.\nNarrowing and blockage of the colon due to tumors can slow or prevent the normal movement of waste, fluids, and gases. As a result, symptoms such as abdominal cramps or changes in bowel habits – constipation or diarrhea – may occur.\nBleeding is another potential symptom. Patients may see bright red blood in their stools or dark brown or black stools.\nIn addition, patients may also have symptoms such as nausea or vomiting, loss of appetite, bloating, abdominal pain, fatigue, weight loss, anemia, etc.\nFatigue, weight loss, and anemia are also symptoms of stage 3 colon cancer",
