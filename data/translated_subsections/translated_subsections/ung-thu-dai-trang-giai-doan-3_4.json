    "subsection_content": "After being diagnosed with colon cancer, your doctor may order laboratory tests to determine the stage of the cancer, including:\nColonoscopy and tumor biopsy\nFlexible colonoscopy helps doctors detect and evaluate tumors in the colon, and at the same time biopsy the tumor for histopathological testing and diagnose and determine the stage of colon cancer.\nFlexible, painless colonoscopy at Tam Anh General Hospital.\nComputed tomography (CT scan)\nCT scan of the chest and abdomen will help evaluate the overall appearance of the tumor, metastatic lymph nodes, whether or not it has metastasized to other locations in the body, and help diagnose the stage of colon cancer.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan)\nMagnetic resonance imaging may be indicated in cases of colon cancer with suspected liver or brain metastases.\nPositron emission tomography (PET/CT scan)\nPET/CT scan is a whole-body imaging technique that uses radioactive drugs attached to glucose (sugar). Tumor cells and metastatic lesions have a higher need for glucose than healthy cells, so when glucose-binding radioactive drugs are injected into the body, tumors and metastatic lesions will appear brighter than the cells. Normal parenchyma helps doctors detect and evaluate the patient's overall health.\nBlood tests\nBasic blood tests help evaluate the patient's anemia, blood clotting function, liver and kidney function, etc.\nTumor marker assay (CEA)\nCEA is released into the blood from both cancer cells and normal cells. When found in higher than normal amounts, it may be a sign of colon cancer or other conditions. The test measures CEA levels in the blood to find signs of cancer.",
