    "subsection_content": "After treatment for stage 3 colon cancer, patients need to pay attention to the following:\nInform your doctor of any side effects you experience after treatment\nPatients may experience side effects after treatment, which can last several weeks to several years. Even side effects do not appear immediately after treatment but can appear a long time after treatment.\nSome people with colon cancer may have prolonged digestive disorders (goes to the toilet many times a day) and can recover after a period of time after treatment. Some people may also have problems with numbness or tingling in the fingers and toes (peripheral neuropathy) as a side effect of the chemicals. Therefore, patients need to notify their treating doctor for instructions on how to alleviate the symptoms of side effects.\nRegular check-ups\nAfter treatment for stage 3 colon cancer, patients continue to have regular check-ups according to the specialist's appointment every 3-6 months.\nTests commonly ordered to monitor cancer after treatment include:\ncolonoscopy\nIn most cases, your doctor will recommend a colonoscopy about a year after surgery. If the results are normal, most will not need another one for 3 years. If the results of that exam are normal, future exams may occur approximately every five years. If a colonoscopy shows abnormalities or polyps, testing may be needed more frequently.\nImage analysation\nWhether your doctor recommends imaging will depend on the stage of the cancer and other factors. CT scans may be performed as often as every 6 months to a year, for people at higher risk of recurrence, especially in the first few years after treatment. People who have had tumors removed from their liver or lungs may have CT scans every 3 to 6 months for the first few years.\nBlood tests look for signs of tumors\nCarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a substance called a tumor marker that can be found in the blood of some people with colorectal cancer. Doctors check the level of this marker with a blood test before starting treatment.\nIf it is high at first and then drops to normal after surgery, it can be rechecked at follow-up visits (usually every 3-6 months for the first few years after treatment, then every 6 months /time or so for the next few years). If CEA levels rise again, it may be a sign that the cancer has returned and an endoscopy or imaging test may be performed to find the site of recurrence.\nIf the tumor marker concentration does not increase compared to the index when cancer was detected, it is not a sign of cancer recurrence.\nAfter treatment, patients need to have regular check-ups every 3-6 months according to the specialist's appointment. Photo of Tam Anh General Hospital\nExercise daily\nMany studies show that people who exercise regularly after colon cancer treatment have a lower risk of recurrence and death. Physical activity has also been linked to improved quality of life and reduced symptoms of fatigue.\nSome studies have also found that sitting or lying down less reduces the risk of death from colorectal cancer. Therefore, patients should exercise every day at a level appropriate to their physical condition.\nHealthy eating\nAlthough no specific diet can help reduce the risk of colorectal cancer recurrence, some studies have suggested that colorectal cancer survivors who eat a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, chicken and fish; Limit your intake of sugar, refined fats, red or processed meat.\nStage 3 colon cancer still has a good prognosis and highly effective treatment. It is important that patients comply with the treatment regimen, maintain an optimistic spirit, have a healthy lifestyle and have regular check-ups according to the doctor's appointment.",
