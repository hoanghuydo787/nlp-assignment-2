According to a report by the US National Cancer Institute, some of those signs may be:\nDue to changes in the body's metabolism, the patient will be drowsy, sleep a lot and/or be unresponsive.; Due to changes in metabolism and other causes, people may become confused about the time, place and/or identity of loved ones; jitter.; Reduced ability to communicate (due to reduced oxygen to the brain, reduced blood flow).; Reduced need for food, loss of appetite (due to the body's need to save energy and the ability to use food is decreasing).; Loss of bladder or bowel control (due to relaxation of pelvic muscles).; Dark urine or decreased urine output (due to impaired kidney function).; Skin that is cold to the touch, especially the hands and feet; the skin may have a bluish tinge, especially the lower body (due to reduced circulation to the extremities).; Shortness of breath; irregular and shallow breathing; decreased number of breaths per minute; Breathing alternates between fast and slow; Turning the head towards the light source (due to decreased visual acuity).; Difficulty controlling pain (due to disease progression).; Involuntary movements (myoclonus), increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, followed by hypotension, and loss of reflexes in the legs and arms.\nStage 4 colon cancer exhibits many easily recognizable symptoms, poor prognosis and is difficult to treat.",
