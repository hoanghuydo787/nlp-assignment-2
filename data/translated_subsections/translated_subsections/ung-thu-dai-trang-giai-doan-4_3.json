    "subsection_content": "According to data from the US Center for Biotechnology (NCBI), at the time of diagnosis, about 25% of newly diagnosed colon cancer patients have metastases; 50% of patients may die from symptoms in metastatic organs. Liver metastases are the most common site of visceral metastases, followed by lung, peritoneal, and pleural metastases. Ovarian metastases occur in 5-8% of all women with colon cancer. Metastasis can occur in any organ of the body. (2)\nThe overall 5-year survival rate of stage 4 colon cancer patients has increased significantly thanks to advances in medicine and the emergence of new treatment drugs.",
