It is valuable when you want to evaluate the tumor invasion into the intestinal wall, regional lymph nodes, evaluate liver metastases or brain metastases.\nPET/CT scan\nPET/CT scan, also known as positron emission tomography, is used to find malignant tumor cells in the body. Before the scan, the patient will be injected with a small amount of glucose tagged with a radioactive isotope through a vein. Cells with increased sugar metabolism activity, including cancer cells, will increase the absorption of glucose attached to radioactive isotopes and when taking a PET/CT scan, doctors will see tumors, metastatic lymph nodes, and distant metastatic lesions. more clearly.\nBlood tests\nBlood tests will help evaluate the patient's condition, whether there is anemia or not, liver and kidney function, etc.\nCarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test\nCEA is called a tumor marker in the blood. CEA is elevated in patients with metastatic colon cancer, used for monitoring and evaluation during treatment.",
