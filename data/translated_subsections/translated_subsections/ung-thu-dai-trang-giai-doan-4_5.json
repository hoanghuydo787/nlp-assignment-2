    "subsection_content": "Stage 4 colon cancer has spread from the colon tumor to distant organs and tissues. The most common is metastasis to the liver, but it can also metastasize to other places such as the lungs, brain, peritoneum...\nIn most cases, surgery is unlikely to cure these types of metastases. But if the cancer has only spread to a few areas in the liver or lungs and can be removed along with the colon cancer, surgery is indicated, which can help the patient live longer.\nTreatment may be surgery to remove the section of colon containing the tumor along with nearby lymph nodes, plus surgery to remove metastatic tumor tissue (peritoneal nucleus, liver tumor, etc.). After surgery, patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy to help increase the effectiveness of disease treatment and reduce the risk of recurrence and metastasis.\nIf the metastases cannot be removed because the tumor is too large or too numerous, the patient may receive chemotherapy before surgery. This method is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, if the tumors shrink, surgery can be performed to remove the tumors. After surgery, patients can continue to receive adjuvant chemotherapy to reduce the risk of recurrence and metastasis. (3)\nIn case cancer causes intestinal obstruction, the patient will need emergency surgery to remove the blocked intestine or install an artificial colostomy to resolve the intestinal obstruction.\nStage 4 colon cancer patients receive chemotherapy and/or combination with targeted drugs to control the cancer.\nThe doctor will evaluate the patient's overall condition, tumors, histopathological type, and treatment methods to choose the appropriate treatment method for stage 4 colon cancer. For people whose tumors have satellite instability, treatment with immunotherapy drugs such as nivolumab (Opdivo) or pembrolizumab (Keytruda) may be an option after initial chemotherapy.\nFor patients with late-stage cancer, radiation therapy can be used to prevent or reduce cancer symptoms such as colon pain.",
