(4)\nPatients need to limit fiber intake for about 6 weeks, then gradually increase fiber intake again. This is because initially after colon resection, patients often have loose stools. If they eat fiber too soon after surgery, it will cause diarrhea.\nPatients should drink plenty of water and drinks that supplement fluids and salt in the body. Your bowels will start to function more normally after a few weeks.\nIt is important for patients to record foods that cause stomach upset.
