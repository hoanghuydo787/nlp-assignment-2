    "subsection_content": "Colon cancer is a cancer that occurs in the colon (the longest part of the large intestine). This is a common cancer diagnosed in both men and women.(2)\nThe colon wall is composed of many layers. Cancer cells are formed from the cells lining the inside of the colon (mucosa), largely due to the growth of polyps in the colon. After appearing on the colon wall, cancer cells begin to move into blood vessels or lymph vessels (small tubes responsible for carrying waste and fluid to the outside).\nThat causes cancer cells to metastasize to nearby lymph nodes, or to move further to other organs in the body.\nColon cancer is a common cancer in both men and women\nMost colon polyps are benign, but they also have the risk of becoming malignant. There are two main types of polyps:\nAdenomatous polyp (adenoma): This type of polyp will sometimes develop into cancer, so it is also called a precancerous condition.; Hyperplastic polyps and inflammatory polyps: These are more common types of polyps, not pre-cancerous conditions.; Dysplasia is also a form of pre-cancer that appears in the polyp itself or the colon lining when abnormal cells are present.",
