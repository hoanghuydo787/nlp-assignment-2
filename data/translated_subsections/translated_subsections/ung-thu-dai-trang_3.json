This condition occurs in both sexes, but the risk is higher in men than in women.\nInactive lifestyle\nUnscientific lifestyle, less physical activity increases the risk of colon cancer. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a reasonable and moderate exercise plan to eliminate the risks of disease.\nUnscientific diet\nA diet containing too much red meat (beef, pork, lamb, liver...), processed foods (sausages, canned meat...) can increase the risk of cancer. In addition, processing food at too high a temperature (frying, baking, etc.) will create harmful chemicals, increasing the risk of cancer. Therefore, it is recommended that you build a scientific diet, supplementing lots of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and limiting red meat and canned processed foods to reduce the risk of cancer. letters.\nSmoke\nPeople who smoke regularly for a long time have a higher risk of getting and dying from colon cancer than non-smokers.\nSmoking is also associated with an increased risk of colon adenoma formation. Smokers who have had colon adenoma surgically removed have a high risk of adenoma recurrence.\nDrink lots of alcohol\nResearch shows that drinking alcohol at a reasonable level has many health benefits, including reducing the risk of many cancers. However, excessive alcohol abuse will increase the risk of colon cancer. The recommended amount of alcohol is ≥ 2 drinks/day for men and 1 drink/day for women (the unit is a standard cup containing about 14 grams of alcohol).\nElderly\nYoung people will still be at risk of getting the disease, but this risk will increase in patients over 50 years old.\nPatient's own medical history\nPatients will be at increased risk of cancer if they have a history of the following diseases:\nHaving had colon cancer before;; High-risk adenomatous polyps are 1cm in size or the polyp's cells have an abnormal shape under a microscope;; Ovarian Cancer;; Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease...\nFamily medical history\nPeople whose parents or siblings have a history of colon cancer have a higher risk of developing the disease. In particular, this risk will increase if the family has an infected person under the age of 50, or the family has many people with the disease. Besides, if a family member has had adenomatous polyps, the risk of getting the disease is also higher. Therefore, you should proactively screen before age 45 for early detection and effective treatment intervention if you have the disease.\nGenetic syndrome\nAbout 5% of patients are due to genetic syndromes, of which the two most common syndromes are Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer - HNPCC) and familial polyposis (FAP).\nIn addition, there are a number of other rare syndromes that can also increase the risk of cancer such as Peutz - Jeghers syndrome (PJS) and MUTYH gene-associated polyposis (MAP). However, it should be noted that these genetic syndromes are not only related to colon cancer, but also to many other cancers.",
