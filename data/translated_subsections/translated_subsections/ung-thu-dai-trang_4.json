    "subsection_content": "Colon cancer is divided into 5 main stages, based on the structure of the colon and the way cancer cells spread from the colon to other organs.\nStage 0\nAbnormal cells are detected in the mucosa (innermost layer) of the colon wall. These abnormal cells can become cancerous and spread to adjacent normal tissues. This stage is also called the local cancer stage.\nPhase I\nCancer cells have formed in the mucosa (innermost layer) of the colon wall and have spread to the submucosa (layer next to the mucosa) or to the muscle layer.\nPhase II\nStage II is divided into IIA, IIB, IIC:\nStage IIA: Cancer grows through the muscle layer, entering the serosal layer of the colon. However, these cells are still only located in the outermost layer of the colon, and have not spread to neighboring tissues and lymph nodes.; Stage IIB: Cancer has grown through the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall to the visceral peritoneum, and has not spread to nearby lymph nodes.; Stage IIC: Cancer has spread, penetrated the colon's serosa, grown to nearby organs but has not spread to nearby lymph nodes.\nPhase III\nStage III is divided into IIIA, IIIB, IIIC:\nStage IIIA: Cancer has spread beyond the mucosa to the submucosa or muscle layer of the colon wall. Cancer cells have also spread to 1-3 lymph nodes or to tissue adjacent to the lymph nodes. Or the cancer spreads beyond the mucosa to the submucosa of the colon wall. Cancer cells have also spread to 4-6 lymph nodes; Cancer spreads beyond the mucosa to the submucosa or to the muscle layer of the colon wall. Cancer cells have also spread to 1-3 lymph nodes or to tissue adjacent to the lymph nodes.; Or the cancer spreads beyond the mucosa to the submucosa of the colon wall. Cancer cells have also spread to 4-6 lymph nodes; Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread beyond the muscle layer of the colon wall to the serosa or beyond the serosa to the visceral peritoneum. Cancer cells have also spread to 1-3 lymph nodes or to tissue adjacent to the lymph nodes. Passes through the muscle layer or through the serosal layer of the colon wall. Cancer cells have also spread to 4-6 lymph nodes. Or pass through the mucosa to the submucosa or to the muscle layer of the colon wall. Cancer cells also spread to at least 7 lymph nodes; Cancer has spread beyond the muscle layer of the colon wall to the serosa or beyond the serosa to the visceral peritoneum. Cancer cells have also spread to 1-3 lymph nodes or to tissue adjacent to the lymph nodes.; Passes through the muscle layer or through the serosal layer of the colon wall. Cancer cells have also spread to 4-6 lymph nodes; Or pass through the mucosa to the submucosa or to the muscle layer of the colon wall. Cancer cells also spread to at least 7 lymph nodes; Stage IIIC: Passes through the serosa to the visceral peritoneum. Cancer cells have also spread to 4-6 nearby lymph nodes. Either through the muscle layer to the serosa or through the serosa to the visceral peritoneum. Cancer cells also spread to at least 7 lymph nodes. Or pass through the serosa layer to adjacent organs. Cancer cells have also spread to at least 1 lymph node or to tissue adjacent to the lymph nodes.; Pass through the serosa to the visceral peritoneum.

Cancer cells have also spread to at least 1 lymph node or to tissue adjacent to the lymph nodes.\nStage IV\nStage IV is divided into IVA, IVB, IVC:\nStage IVA: Cancer has spread to an area or organ away from the colon, such as the liver, lungs, ovaries, or lymph nodes distant from the colon.; Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to many areas or organs away from the colon.; Stage IVC: Cancer has spread to the tissues of the inner lining of the abdomen and may have spread to other areas and organs.\nSee more: 5 stages of colon cancer: How to evaluate and diagnose in detail.",
