However, this technique will contribute to detecting indirect warning signs such as thickened colon wall, intestinal obstruction, etc.; Blood test in stool: Blood in stool can be seen when there are polyps, cancer or some other diseases of the colon.; CT scan or MRI: To detect the shape, size and level of invasion of the tumor, and to detect the spread of cancer to other organs in the body. .; Colonoscopy: This is a technique to look inside the colon, where polyps, abnormal tissue areas or cancer can be observed. Through endoscopy, people use equipment to take samples of abnormal tissue for biopsy.; Biopsy: A sample of abnormal tissue or cells is examined under a microscope by a pathologist to look for malignant cells.\nColonoscopy combined with biopsy helps detect colon cancer early",
