At the Oncology Department, Tam Anh General Hospital, treatment plans are always suitable for each individual patient based on updating the latest treatment guidelines in the world. (5)\nTreatments that may be prescribed include:\nSurgery\nSurgery is a commonly used method in most stages of colon cancer. After surgery, the patient may continue to receive chemotherapy and radiotherapy to destroy remaining cancer cells.\nThe cancerous part of the colon and lymph glands will be removed. Laparoscopic surgery or keyhole surgery helps patients avoid long scars after surgery. This new method has the advantage of shortening recovery time after surgery and minimizing the risk of infection. In some necessary cases, laparoscopic surgery will be combined with open surgery, but only with a short scar.\nRadiotherapy\nA method that uses high-energy beams to kill cancer cells or slow their growth. The way radiotherapy will be applied depends on the type and stage of the cancer.\nFor malignant tumors in the colon, radiotherapy is only used in cases where the disease has metastasized to the bones, brain, etc.\nValence\nChemotherapy is a treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth, kill, or prevent the division of cancer cells. When the drug is taken orally or administered intravenously, it enters the bloodstream and targets cancer cells throughout the body. Chemotherapy drugs will be used depending on the type and stage of the cancer.\nChemotherapy combined with targeted drugs is indicated for patients with advanced colon cancer with signs of metastasis to other organs in the body (such as liver, lungs...) that cannot be treated. Treated with simple surgical methods.\nThis method is also used after colon cancer surgery to prevent the risk of disease recurrence, as well as increase the patient's chance of survival if there are signs of metastasis to lymph nodes adjacent to the cancerous area.\nTargeted treatment\nTargeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs to target and destroy cancer cells with specific characteristics. Targeted drugs commonly used in colon cancer:\nMonoclonal antibodies.; Vascular antibiotics.\nImmunity\nImmunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer.\nDepending on the stage of the disease and the patient's wishes, the doctor will prescribe an appropriate treatment regimen",
