(first)\nPenile cancer is rare, but if detected early, it can be completely treated.\nPenile cancer is divided into the following types:\n1. Squamous cell carcinoma\nSquamous cell carcinoma accounts for 95% of penile cancer cases. The disease often appears in the outermost layer of skin, so it is called carcinoma. However, the disease can also progress in other parts of the penis.\n2. Basal cell carcinoma\nIn contrast to squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma occurs in the final layer of the epithelium. The characteristic of this form of cancer is that it grows slowly and is unable to spread to other areas of the body.\n3. Melanoma\nIt is a form of cancer that begins in the cells that give skin its color, also called melanocytes.\n4. Sarcoma\nSarcoma is a term used to describe cancers that start in bones and soft tissues. For penile cancer, signs form in tissues such as blood vessels, muscle and fat.",
