If stage 0 or 1 penile cancer is detected, still limited to the penis, from the time of diagnosis, the 5-year survival rate is about 85% after surgery. In stages 3 and 4, the 5-year survival rate is about 59%. If cancer metastasizes to distant parts of the body, the 5-year survival rate is 11%.\nTherefore, depending on when cancer is detected, the earlier it is detected, the higher the chance of curing it and preserving the \"little guy\". If detected slowly, the patient's life time will be shortened.",
