This type of cancer tends to progress very quickly, so it is often diagnosed when it has reached a late stage.\nHepatoblastoma\nThis type of liver cancer is extremely rare. Most cases of the disease occur in children, especially those under 3 years old.\nIf treated with surgery and chemotherapy, the prognosis for people with hepatoblastoma can be very good. If the disease is detected in its early stages, survival rates are often higher than 90%.",
