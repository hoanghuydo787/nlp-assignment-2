Crops, such as grains and nuts, can be contaminated with aflatoxins. As a result, foods made from them become dangerous pathogens for the liver.; Excessive alcohol consumption: Consuming more than the recommended amount of alcohol over many years can lead to irreversible liver damage, increasing the risk of liver cancer.\nThe risk of liver cancer increases in people who drink too much alcohol over a long period of time",
