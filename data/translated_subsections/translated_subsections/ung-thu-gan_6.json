    "subsection_content": "Liver cancer is dangerous in that it can lead to a number of complications. The most noticeable is the condition where the tumor blocks the bile duct, damages liver cells, and disrupts liver function, leading to the accumulation of toxins in the body and other complications.\nAnemia\nAnemia (low red blood cell count) is a very common complication of liver cancer. The cause of this complication is due to lack of clotting factors leading to bleeding. Prolonged anemia can make the patient feel tired, short of breath, have a fast heart rate, pale skin and dizziness.\nBile duct blockage\nBile is created in the liver. The ducts are the \"pathways\" that transport bile to the gallbladder and to the small intestine. Liver tumors or bile duct tumors can develop in the duct or nearby, leading to blockage of the bile duct. When the duct is blocked, it will cause pain in the right upper abdomen, nausea, vomiting, jaundice and itching.\nBleed\nThe liver is responsible for making proteins (clotting factors) that help blood clot. When a large portion of the liver has been damaged by cancer cells, blood clotting proteins are no longer produced in sufficient quantities. As a result, bleeding can occur (even with a normal platelet count) leading to anemia. The first sign of this complication is often bleeding when brushing your teeth or frequent nosebleeds. At a more serious level, the patient is at risk of internal bleeding.\nEsophageal varices\nA tumor in the liver makes it difficult for blood to circulate through the small veins in the esophagus to the large veins, gradually causing varicose veins. When small veins rupture, they lead to bleeding in the esophagus, called esophageal variceal bleeding, which is life-threatening if not treated quickly. Similarly, this complication is also likely to occur in the stomach and intestines.\nHepatorenal syndrome\nThis is a condition in which liver disease affects the kidneys due to changes in blood vessels that reduce blood flow to the kidneys. Hepatorenal syndrome is very common in patients with liver cancer as well as other liver diseases. Experts estimate that 40% of people with cirrhosis will develop this syndrome within 5 years. Unfortunately, those with hepatorenal syndrome often cannot recover unless a liver transplant is performed.\nHepatic encephalopathy\nToxins that the liver cannot remove will travel to the brain causing memory loss, disorientation, personality changes and confusion. There are many ways to treat hepatic encephalopathy, and the prognosis depends on the severity of the liver tumor.",
