Tell your doctor if you have a long history of drinking alcohol or have chronic hepatitis B or C infection.\nDiagnostic tests and procedures include:\nLiver function tests such as measuring protein, albumin, liver enzymes and bilirubin levels in the blood: help doctors determine the health status of the liver.; Test for liver tumor markers in the blood: AFP (alpha-fetoprotein), AFP-L3, PIVKA-II (prothrombin induced by the absence of vitamin K or antagonist-II) in the blood: If the results are high, the possibility Liver cancer is quite high.; Abdominal ultrasound, abdominal CT scan or hepatobiliary MRI: help create detailed images of the liver and other organs in the abdomen. Thanks to that, doctors can determine the location and size of the growing tumor, thereby assessing whether it has metastasized to other organs or not.\nAbdominal ultrasound is an imaging method that helps in early detection and is easy to perform during screening for everyone.\nMost cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be definitively diagnosed if the patient has a typical liver tumor image on CT or MRI images, and has increased liver cancer markers in the blood ( AFP), with or without hepatitis B/C infection without the need for liver tumor biopsy.\nIn some necessary cases, for diagnosis, the doctor will prescribe a liver biopsy. Under ultrasound or CT guidance, the doctor will insert a needle through the abdominal wall into the gas tumor and take a small sample of liver tissue. The tissue sample is then examined under a microscope to look for cancer cells. Liver biopsy can also be performed by laparoscopy. A small, flexible tube with a camera attached will be inserted into the abdomen through a small incision. The camera allows doctors to clearly see the liver and take tissue samples accurately.\nNeedle biopsy of liver tumor\nAfter being diagnosed with liver cancer, the doctor will determine the stage of the disease, thereby providing an appropriate treatment regimen as well as prognosis.",
