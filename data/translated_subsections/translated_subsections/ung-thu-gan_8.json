    "subsection_content": "The doctor will consider which method to treat liver cancer based on the following factors: (5)\nNumber, size and location of tumors in the liver;; Liver function;; Have cirrhosis or not;; Has the tumor metastasized to lymph nodes or other organs?\nCommon methods used to treat liver cancer include:\nSurgery\nHepatectomy is performed to remove the part of the liver containing the tumor. This method is often performed when cancer cells are limited to the liver. Over time, the remaining healthy liver tissue will enlarge and replace the removed part.\nLiver transplant\nPart or all of the liver carrying a liver tumor will be replaced with a healthy liver from a donor. Transplantation is only performed if the cancer has not metastasized to other organs. After surgery, patients need to take medication to prevent rejection.\nInjecting ethanol into liver tumors\nFor this method, after anesthetizing the patient, the doctor will inject absolute alcohol (ethanol) into liver tumors smaller than 3cm in size under ultrasound guidance to destroy cancer cells.\nHigh-frequency ablation of liver tumors\nThe doctor will insert a high-frequency waveguide needle into the liver tumor through the abdominal wall under ultrasound guidance or during surgery to burn liver tumors smaller than 3cm in size.\nChemical circuit plug\nThis is a common treatment method for liver cancer patients. Liver tumors are fed by the hepatic artery. Under the digital subtraction scanner (DSA), the doctor inserts a catheter through the femoral artery to the artery that feeds the liver tumor, injects chemicals that attach the sphere to the tumor and plugs this blood vessel. Tumor cells are destroyed due to cutting off blood supply and the effects of chemical drugs.\nRadioembolization (also called selective internal radiotherapy)\nThis is a method of directly injecting radioactive microspheres Y-90 (Yttrium 90) into the arterial branch feeding the liver tumor. These radioactive microspheres block microvessels in the tumor and emit radiation that kills cancer cells.\nExternal radiotherapy\nRadiation therapy is a method that uses high-energy radiation beams to target a tumor to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy/Targeted drugs/Immune drugs\nIn patients with large tumors, vascular invasion or distant metastases, tumors that recur after surgery or have failed other treatments, doctors will prescribe systemic treatment with chemotherapy drugs. Intravenous infusion, oral or intravenous targeted therapy drugs, intravenous immunotherapy drugs. This method helps reduce tumor growth and metastasis.\nPalliative care\nThese are medical interventions that help reduce complications of cancer: pain relief, protein infusion to improve physical condition...",
