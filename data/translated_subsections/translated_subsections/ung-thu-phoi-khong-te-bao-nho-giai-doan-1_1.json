    "subsection_content": "Lung cancer staging is based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system, which includes three main factors:\nT (Tumor): Evaluates the mass of cancer cells that first form in the lung, also known as the primary tumor. (2)\nEvaluate T based on the following three factors:; Measure tumor size in centimeter (cm) units; Degree of tumor invasion into adjacent structures; Number of tumors in the lungs.; The T factor comes with a number from 1-4. This number represents the degree of growth of the tumor. A larger number corresponds to a greater level of development.\nT factor T1  The tumor is ≤ 3cm in size, may invade the adjacent lobar bronchus (not the main bronchus) but has not invaded the distant bronchi. T1a  Tumor ≤ 1cm in size. The tumor may have invaded the inner lining of the lungs, or the large airways. T1b  Tumor size > 1cm, ≤ 2 cm. The tumor may have invaded the inner lining of the lungs, or the large airways. T1c  Tumor size > 2cm, ≤ 3 cm. The tumor may have invaded the inner lining of the lungs, or the large airways. T2  The tumor is > 3cm, ≤ 5cm, or has one of the following characteristics: 1) Invades the main bronchus but has not invaded the bifurcation of the 2 main bronchi. 2) Invasion of the visceral pleura. 3) Causes atelectasis or obstructive pneumonia to the hilar area, affecting part or all of one lung. T2a  Tumor size > 3cm, ≤ 4 cm. The tumor may have invaded the inner lining of the lungs, or the large airways.\nN (Node): Lymph nodes (or nodes for short) are small oval structures that help the body fight disease. N-factor assessment is to assess the extent of spread to nearby lymph nodes from the primary tumor. The N factor comes with a number from 1 to 3. This number represents the extent of spread to the lymph nodes. Larger numbers correspond to greater spread. (3)\nM (Metastasis): The M factor indicates that the cancer has spread to other organs of the body (also called metastasis). Lung cancer often metastasizes to organs such as the brain, bones, adrenal glands, liver, contralateral lungs...\nCombining the elements T, N, M  gives the specific stage.\nStage I includes stages IA and IB.\nLung cancer stage IA IA1  T1a N0 M0 IA2  T1b N0 M0 IA3  T1c N0 M0 Lung cancer stage IB IB  T2a N0 M0\nStage I, cancer has not spread to nearby lymph nodes, and has not spread to other organs in the body (N0, M0).\nSee more:\nStage 2 non-small cell lung cancer; Stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer; Stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer",
