    "subsection_content": "Low-dose chest CT (LDCT) is the lung cancer screening method recommended by experts.\nStage I non-small cell lung cancer is often discovered when the patient comes to the doctor because of symptoms, or sometimes discovered accidentally during a CT scan or chest X-ray. Abnormal manifestations on CT scans or chest X-rays are important suggestions to help doctors diagnose lung cancer.\nAccording to MSc. Nguyen Tien Sy, some common lung cancer symptoms include:\nCough a lot, persistent cough; Productive cough; Hemoptisi; Pain in the chest or shoulder; Feeling tired; Short of breath; Unexplained weight loss.\nStage I non-small cell lung cancer can also be detected through routine screening using a low-dose CT scan of the chest. Subjects recommended for annual lung cancer screening according to the US Preventive Medicine Agency are:\nPeople ≥ 50 years old + smoking history of 20 pack years or more. Unit pack.year = average number of cigarettes smoked per day/20 × number of years smoked (a pack has 20 cigarettes).\nThe results of the low-dose chest CT scan will be compared with previous results. The time for the next CT scan may be yearly, or vary depending on the risk and results of previous CT scans. Screening is important to help detect the disease at an early stage, giving patients the best chance of treatment, improving survival rates and helping to reduce treatment costs.\nCurrently, Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City is equipped with a 768-slice CT scanning system applying artificial intelligence. This is the most modern machine, with an extremely low X-ray dose (1 - 1.5 millisieverts, lower than the radiation dose a normal person is exposed to in 6 months), providing optimal results based on on minimal risks. The doctor obtains 3-dimensional images of the lungs and observes the growth of even the smallest tumor, making diagnoses of the disease and its stage. The whole process is quick and painless for the patient. In addition, with the support of artificial intelligence (AI) software, it helps increase accuracy and save time for doctors and patients.\nWhen lung cancer is suspected, other tests such as bronchoscopy, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), PET-CT, tissue sample biopsy... may be performed to confirm. Diagnosis and staging of the disease.",
