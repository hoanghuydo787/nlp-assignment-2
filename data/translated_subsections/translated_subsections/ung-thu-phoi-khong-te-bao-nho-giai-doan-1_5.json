    "subsection_content": "Patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer have the best prognosis among the 4 stages of lung cancer. The choice of treatment method mainly depends on the stage of the disease, and also needs to consider factors such as the type of lung cancer, related gene mutations, the patient's health status, and other medical conditions. accompanied by economic conditions...\nTreatment methods for stage I non-small cell lung cancer include: Surgery, radiotherapy, systemic therapy (such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy...).\nSurgery: includes tumor removal, removal of one or more lung lobes and lymph node dissection\nIn stage I, the lung tumor is small in size, has not metastasized to nearby lymph nodes and has not metastasized far. Surgery is the first treatment option. Surgery is performed with the goal of completely removing the tumor from the body. The tumor was removed along with a portion of surrounding lung tissue. This portion of lung tissue is called the surgical margin. (4)\nThere are 5 types of lung cancer surgery, chosen depending on the stage of the disease as well as the patient's physical condition and other accompanying diseases:\nWedge surgery: removal of a small wedge-shaped piece of lung. This surgery only removes the tumor-containing part of the lung lobe, not the entire lobe.; Lobectomy: removal of one or more segments but less than total lobectomy; Lobectomy: remove the entire lobe of the lung containing the tumor. After surgery, the remaining lung will inflate to compensate for the removed lung, so normal lung function is continued.\nThis is the preferred treatment method for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer to cure the disease. Lobectomy may be the only treatment for this group of patients, or it may be combined with systemic therapies such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or targeted cancer therapy. stage IB non-small cell lung.\nLobectomy: removal of the entire lobe of the lung along with part of the airway. The remaining lung lobe and airway are connected to continue functioning. This method is designed to avoid having to remove one lung.; Pneumonectomy: complete removal of one lung. This is surgery performed when the lung tumor is large, spreading beyond one lobe of the lung. The tumor is located in the central area of ​​the lung and cannot be completely removed by less invasive surgical methods as mentioned above. tumor set. Before surgery, patients need to have their lung function evaluated to ensure they can continue to live with only one lung.\nLymphadenectomy\nLymph node dissection is the term for a surgical method to remove lymph nodes adjacent to the tumor. In lung cancer surgery, the lymph node dissection process will remove the lymph nodes in the lung and the lymph nodes adjacent to the lung containing the tumor. Some lymph nodes suspected of metastasis can be tested before lymph node dissection. If the lymph nodes are metastatic, the surgeon will remove as many lymph nodes as possible.\nPreviously, lung tumor surgery was often performed using the thoracotomy method. This method requires making a large incision in the chest and opening the ribs to gain direct access to the lungs. Currently, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS = Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery) is becoming more popular with the advantages of less invasiveness, small incisions and faster recovery time.\nThe patient underwent thoracoscopic surgery to remove lung tumors at Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City\nRadiotherapy\nRadiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays (radiation) to treat cancer.\nRadiation damages cancer cells, causing them to stop reproducing and die. In some cases of stage I non-small cell lung cancer, radiation therapy may be given after surgery to treat residual cancer near the tumor site. (5)\nWhole body treatment\nFor stage IB non-small cell lung cancer, after surgery, doctors may consider supportive treatments to reduce the risk of disease recurrence and increase the possibility of cure. Supportive treatments include chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy.\nChemotherapy: using chemicals to kill rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells. Chemicals are often injected slowly intravenously or taken orally so they can reach the entire body. In stage I (early stage) non-small cell lung cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy given after surgery usually includes Cisplatin or Carboplatin combined with another chemotherapy agent.\nTargeted therapy: Therapy that blocks the special mechanisms by which cancer cells continue to exist and grow. In stage I non-small cell lung cancer, typical targeted therapy is Osimertinib (Tagrisso) used in adjuvant treatment after surgery and chemotherapy if the patient has suitable gene mutations.\nStage I non-small cell lung cancer, if treated properly and sufficiently, has a very high chance of cure. However, cancer at this stage still has the ability to recur, although the rate is low. After treatment, patients need to have follow-up appointments to detect abnormalities early and promptly treat them. Although not a treatment measure, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, exercising, scientific diet, and optimistic thinking also make an important contribution to improving the patient's quality of life during and after. at the end of treatment.\nTo schedule an examination, screening and treatment of lung cancer at the Oncology Department, Tam Anh General Hospital System, please contact:\nStage I non-small cell lung cancer is not a death sentence as many people think.
