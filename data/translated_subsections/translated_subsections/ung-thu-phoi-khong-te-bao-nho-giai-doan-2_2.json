Patients may not notice any unusual signs until the disease is detected.\nDr. Vu Tran Minh Nguyen said that symptoms that patients with stage II non-small cell lung cancer may experience are: (3)\nPersistent or recurring cough, bronchitis or pneumonia that does not improve with medical treatment; Coughing up blood, coughing up dark red or bright red blood; Frequent chest pain; Feeling short of breath, difficulty breathing or not having enough strength when performing daily activities (such as climbing stairs, exercising, walking...).; Fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss.\nHowever, there are still cases where the patient does not have any symptoms at all, only accidentally discovering the disease during a health check or examination for other diseases.",
