    "subsection_content": "Stage II non-small cell lung cancer is still considered early stage, with a 5-year survival prognosis of over 50%.\nNon-small cell lung cancer is a dangerous disease and the leading cause of death in both men and women, but if detected and treated promptly when the disease is still in its early stages (stages I and II), the rate of death is high. The patient's 5-year survival rate can still reach over 50% from the time the disease is diagnosed. In particular, the 5-year survival rate for stage IIA lung cancer is 60%, for stage IIB is 53%. (4)\nIn addition to the stage of cancer, the patient's survival rate can be affected by a number of factors such as:\nAge: The 5-year survival rate tends to decrease as the patient gets older; Gender: Compared to men, women's survival rate after 5 years is 1.17 times higher, and after 10 years it is 1.4 times higher.; Underlying medical condition: Important impact on the patient's ability to live. For example, a group of patients in their 70s with good health may have a higher survival rate than a group of patients in their 60s with poor health and many comorbidities.; Smoking: Not quitting smoking after a lung cancer diagnosis can reduce survival rates.; Type of lung cancer: Non-small cell lung cancer includes many types of cells, there are  3 common cell types: Adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma (or also known as squamous cell carcinoma). squamous)  and large cell carcinoma. Among them, adenocarcinoma has the highest survival rate, large cell carcinoma has the lowest survival rate.; Type of surgery: The 5-year survival rate of patients undergoing lobectomy is twice as high as that of patients undergoing pneumonectomy (31.5% and 15.6%, respectively).",
