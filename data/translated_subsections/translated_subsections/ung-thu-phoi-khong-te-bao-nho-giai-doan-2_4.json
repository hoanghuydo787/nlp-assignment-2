    "subsection_content": "Most stage II non-small cell lung cancers are discovered incidentally through chest X-rays. After examining the patient, doctors may prescribe additional tests and imaging to confirm the diagnosis of cancer. Among them, the most popular means in Vietnam to evaluate lung cancer is computed tomography (CT scan).\nThere are many CT scanner systems, but the dual-balloon machine system at Tam Anh General Hospital is considered the most effective and modern.\nWith the ability to reproduce 768 lung slices, the machine can measure the smallest lesions from all angles (even lung nodules only 2-3mm). In particular, the 768-slice CT system is also equipped with a Tin filter and AI artificial intelligence application, helping to minimize the dose of X-rays used, so patients can safely perform the technique. This.
