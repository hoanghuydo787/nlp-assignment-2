    "subsection_content": "Surgery\nIf the patient is healthy enough, surgery is the standard treatment for patients with stage II non-small cell lung cancer. Common lung cancer surgery methods include: (5)\nLobectomy + regional lymph node dissection: The most preferred surgical method. The lungs have 5 lobes (left lung has 2 lobes, right lung has 3 lobes). The doctor will remove one of the 5 lung lobes with the tumor, along with lymph node dissection of the corresponding lung lobe.; Wedge resection: often applied when the tumor is small or the patient's lung function has decreased. The doctor will minimally remove the lung tumor and some healthy lung tissue around the tumor, with or without regional lymph node dissection.
