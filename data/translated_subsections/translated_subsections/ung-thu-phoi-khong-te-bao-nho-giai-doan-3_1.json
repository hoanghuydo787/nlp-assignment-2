    "subsection_content": "According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC: the American Joint Committee on Cancer), the TNM staging system includes 3 elements: (2)\nT (Tumor): T is numbered from 0-4, the larger the number, the larger the tumor, the more invasive, the worse the prognosis.; N (Node - Lymph Node): N is numbered from 0-3, describing the condition of metastasis to neighboring lymph nodes (regional lymph nodes).; M (Metastasis - Metastasis): Distant metastasis to other organs (contralateral lung, brain, bones, adrenal glands...) or metastasis to lymph nodes other than regional lymph nodes.\nThanks to the TNM staging system, doctors have a detailed picture of the patient's tumor, from which they can propose the most appropriate treatment plan.\nStage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer\nAccording to the 2017 American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) guidelines, stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer is classified according to TNM as follows:\nTNM staging system Description T1a-c N2 M0  T1: The tumor is ≤ 3cm in size, has not invaded the visceral pleura, and has not spread to the main bronchus. N2: Metastasis to lymph nodes under the carina (the carina is where the right and left bronchi divide) or the mediastinum on the same side of the lung. M0: Has not metastasized to other organs of the body. Or T2a-b N2 M0  T2: The tumor has one or more of the following characteristics: The tumor is 3 – 5 cm in size. The tumor has spread to the main bronchus, but has not spread to the carina. The tumor invades the visceral pleura (membrane surrounding the lungs). The tumor causes atelectasis or obstructive pneumonia, affecting part or all of the lung. N2: Metastasis to subcarinal or mediastinal lymph nodes on the same side of the lung. M0: Has not metastasized to other organs of the body. Either T3 N1 or N2 M0  T3: The tumor has one or more of the following characteristics: Size from 5 – 7 cm. The tumor invades the chest wall, parietal pleura, phrenic nerve, or pericardium. There are 2 or more separate tumors in the same lobe of the lung. N1: Metastasis to lymph nodes in the lung and/or hilar lymph nodes, parabronchial lymph nodes on the same side. N2: Metastasis to subcarinal or mediastinal lymph nodes on the same side of the lung. M0: Has not metastasized to other organs of the body. Either T4 N0 or N1 M0  T4:  The tumor has one or more of the following characteristics: The tumor is over 7cm in size. The tumor invades the mediastinum, heart, large blood vessels (aorta...), trachea, esophagus, diaphragm, spine, or carina, recurrent laryngeal nerve. There is 1 or more separate tumors in another lobe of the lung that have not metastasized to the contralateral lung. N0: No regional lymph node metastasis. N1: Metastasis to lymph nodes in the lung, hilar lymph nodes, and parabronchial lymph nodes on the same side. M0: Has not metastasized to other organs of the body.\nStage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer\nAccording to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 2017 guidelines, stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer is classified according to TNM as follows: (3)\nTNM staging system Description  T1a-c N3 M0  T1: Tumor is ≤ 3cm in size, has not invaded the visceral pleura, and has not spread to the main bronchus. N3: Metastasis to contralateral mediastinal lymph nodes, contralateral hilar lymph nodes, ipsilateral or contralateral trapezius lymph nodes, supraclavicular lymph nodes. M0: Has not metastasized to other organs of the body Or T2a-b N3 M0  T2: Tumor has one or more of the following characteristics: Tumor is 3 - 5 cm in size.

There are 2 or more separate tumor nodules in the same lobe of the lung.
