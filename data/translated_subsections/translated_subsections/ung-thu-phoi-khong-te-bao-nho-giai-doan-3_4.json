    "subsection_content": "According to Dr. Vu Tran Minh Nguyen, most lung cancer patients are diagnosed when the disease has progressed to stage III or stage IV. Clinical examination and chest X-ray are the first measures usually taken. After that, the doctor may do additional tests and imaging to confirm the diagnosis of cancer.
