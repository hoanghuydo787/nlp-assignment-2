    "subsection_content": "Currently, cancer treatment guidelines from the Ministry of Health and cancer associations around the world emphasize the role of combining many treatment methods (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy...), in order to Optimize treatment effectiveness.\nThe combination of multiple treatment methods (also called multimodality treatment) is clearly shown in the treatment of stage III non-small cell lung cancer; helps increase disease control, reduce the risk of relapse after treatment and improve patient survival. (5)\nStage IIIA\nAccording to Dr. Vu Tran Minh Nguyen, treatment of stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer may include the following situations:\nSurgery first, followed by supportive treatment to destroy remaining tumor cells, helps reduce the risk of recurrence. Supportive treatment methods include radiotherapy, chemotherapy, concurrent chemo-radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy. The choice of supportive treatment will depend on the post-operative pathology results and each patient's individual condition (physical condition, comorbidities...).; Chemistry and radiation are completely simultaneous. This is a method that combines chemotherapy and radiotherapy at the same time, used in cases of stage IIIA lung cancer that cannot be operated on. Patients after radical concurrent chemotherapy and radiation can be treated with immunotherapy (Durvalumab – Imfinzi) to improve survival rate.; Concurrent chemotherapy and radiation before surgery. This method is often applied in cases where the tumor is at the top of the lung. After concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the patient will be evaluated for surgery. At this time there will be 2 situations:\nIf the condition is currently operable, the patient will undergo surgery. Then, depending on the results after surgery, the doctor will recommend appropriate supportive treatment methods. If the condition still cannot be operated on, the patient will continue to receive chemotherapy.; If the condition is currently operable, the patient will undergo surgery. Then, depending on the results after surgery, the doctor will recommend appropriate supportive treatment methods.; If the condition still cannot be operated on, the patient will continue to receive chemotherapy.; Prior chemotherapy (also called neoadjuvant chemotherapy), can be combined with immunotherapy (Nivolumab – Opdivo). After the neoadjuvant treatment phase, depending on treatment response, the patient may receive surgery or concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\nStage IIIB, IIIC\nFor stage IIIB cancer onwards, Dr. Vu Tran Minh Nguyen said that radical treatment with surgery is almost impossible because the disease has progressed too far. During this period, concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the main treatment method, followed by consolidation treatment with immunotherapy with Durvalumab.\nIn some cases, patients cannot receive chemotherapy and radiation at the same time due to the metastasis of cancer, accompanying diseases... the patient can receive radiation therapy or chemotherapy alone.",
