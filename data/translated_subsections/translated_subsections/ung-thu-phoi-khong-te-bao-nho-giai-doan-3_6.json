    "subsection_content": "Immunotherapy\nAccording to Dr. Vu Tran Minh Nguyen, maintenance treatment with Atezolizumab (Tecentriq) or Pembrolizumab (Keytruda): can be prescribed after the patient has had surgery and supportive chemotherapy. The use of maintenance immunotherapy after adjuvant chemotherapy shows a clear improvement in patient survival time.\nConsolidation treatment with Durvalumab (Imfinzi): recommended after the patient has had concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy, also shows a clear improvement in the patient's survival time.\nTargeted therapy\nPreviously, targeted therapy was often used in cases of late-stage lung cancer with distant metastases. Currently, the use of Osimertinib (Tagrisso) for treatment after surgery or chemotherapy has shown to significantly improve survival time for patients with appropriate EGFR mutations.\nIn addition to the standard treatment methods mentioned above, the introduction of immunotherapy drugs (Cemiplimab, Tremelimumab,...) and new generation targeted drugs (Sotorasib, Adagrasib...) contributes to prolonging survival and improving survival time. quality of life for patients.",
