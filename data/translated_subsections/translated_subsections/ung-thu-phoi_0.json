    "subsection_content": "Lung cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the lungs, also known as malignant tumor in the respiratory tract. The disease occurs when a malignant tumor forms in the lungs, rapidly growing in size, leading to invasion and compression of surrounding organs. The two lungs in the chest have the function of absorbing oxygen when inhaled and releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) when exhaling.\nDoctors divide malignant lung (respiratory tract) tumors into two main types based on the appearance of the cancerous tumor cells under a microscope (2). That is:\nNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounts for 80 - 85% of all cases. This is a general term for several types of malignant lung tumors, including squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma.; Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for about 15 – 20% of cases. This type occurs almost exclusively in heavy smokers and is less common than non-small cell cancer.\nIn addition, there are still cases where benign lung tumors can appear. Benign tumors are fundamentally very different from malignant tumors (cancer cells). However, to be able to accurately determine the nature of the tumor, scientific and accurate diagnostic methods from doctors and medical experts are still needed.",
