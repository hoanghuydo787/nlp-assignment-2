Accurately diagnosing the stage of the disease will help doctors have a suitable treatment regimen. Because the disease does not cause obvious symptoms in its early stages, it is often only diagnosed when tumor cells have spread.\nThe four stages of non-small cell lung cancer include:\nStage 1: Cancer cells are found in the lungs, but they have not spread beyond this area;; Stage 2: Cells appear in the lungs and nearby lymph nodes;; Stage 3: Cells are found in the lungs and lymph nodes in the middle of the chest: Stage 3A: Cancer cells are found in lymph nodes, but only on the same side of the chest where the malignant cells first appeared presently; Stage 3B: Cancer has spread to lymph nodes on the opposite chest, or to lymph nodes above the collarbone.; Stage 3A: Cancer cells are in the lymph nodes, but only on the same side of the chest where the malignant cells first appeared;; Stage 3B: Cancer has spread to lymph nodes on the opposite chest, or to lymph nodes above the collarbone.; Stage 4: Late-stage cancer has spread to both lungs, to the area around the site, or to distant organs.\nMeanwhile, small cell lung cancer has 2 main stages:\nLimited stage: Cancer cells appear only in one lung or nearby lymph nodes on the same side of the chest.; Extensive stage: Malignant tumors have spread Throughout one lung; To the opposite lung; To the lymph nodes on the opposite side; Spreads to fluid around the lungs; To the bone marrow; To distant agencies; All over one lung;; To the opposite lung;; To the lymph nodes on the opposite side;; Spreads to fluid around the lungs;; To the bone marrow;; To distant agencies.\nStatistics show that at the time of diagnosis, 2 out of 3 people with small cell cancer are already in the extensive stage.",
