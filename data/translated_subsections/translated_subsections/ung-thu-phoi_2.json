    "subsection_content": "Basically, the symptoms of these two types of malignant lung tumors are similar. The initial symptoms that can be seen are often:\nProlonged cough;; Cough with phlegm or blood;; Chest pain that gets worse when breathing deeply, laughing or coughing;; Hoarse voice;; Short of breath;; Wheeze;; Weakness and fatigue;; Loss of appetite leads to weight loss.\nFatigue, prolonged cough, anorexia leading to weight loss should be wary of malignant lung tumors\nIn the early stages, patients may also have recurrent respiratory infections such as pneumonia or bronchitis. As the tumor spreads, a variety of other symptoms will appear, depending on where the new tumor forms. Specifically, if the tumor appears in:\nLymph nodes: the patient has a lump, especially in the neck or collarbone;; Bones: the patient feels bone pain, especially in the back, ribs or hips;; Brain or spine: symptoms may include headache, dizziness, easy loss of balance or numbness of the arms/legs'; Esophagus: causes difficulty swallowing;; Liver: the patient has yellow skin and eyes.\nTumors that appear on the top of the lungs can affect the nerves in the face, leading to drooping eyelids, small pupils, not sweating on one side of the face, and shoulder pain. These symptoms are called Horner syndrome. If the tumor presses on the large veins that transport blood between the head, arms and heart, it will lead to swelling of the face, neck, upper chest and arms.\nIn addition, sometimes lung cancer cells also cause the body to produce a hormone-like substance, causing a series of symptoms called paraneoplastic syndrome, including:\nMuscle weakness;; Nausea and vomiting;; Retain water in the body;; High Blood Pressure;; High blood sugar;; Confusion;; Convulsion;; Comatose.",
