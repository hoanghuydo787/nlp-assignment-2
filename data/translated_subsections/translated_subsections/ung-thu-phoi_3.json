    "subsection_content": "Air pollution is the leading cause of malignant tumors:\n1. Cigarette smoke\nTobacco is the number 1 cause of respiratory diseases\nAccording to Prof. Dr. Ngo Quy Chau, anyone can be at risk of getting the disease, but 90% of acute lung cancer cases are caused by smoking. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), smokers are 15 - 30 times more likely to develop respiratory tumors than non-smokers (3). Even if you do not smoke, the risk of  increases if you are exposed to tobacco smoke regularly (passive smoking).\nWhen cigarette smoke enters the body, it begins to damage lung tissue. The lungs can repair this damage, but inhaling cigarette smoke every day gradually causes it to lose its ability to heal itself.\nOnce lung cells are damaged, they begin to function abnormally, increasing the likelihood of developing respiratory malignancies. This is why small cell lung cancer is almost always associated with heavy smoking. Only by stopping smoking will you reduce your risk of disease over time.\n2. Exposure to Radon\nAccording to the American Lung Association, the second cause of tumors in the lung area is exposure to radon - a naturally occurring radioactive gas (4). Radon enters buildings through small cracks in the foundation. People who both smoke and are exposed to radon gas are at very high risk of cancer.\n3. Absorb harmful gases\nBreathing other toxic substances over a long period of time will lead to pulmonary fibrosis. Your risk of melanoma increases sevenfold if lung fibrosis progresses. Some substances considered to be pathogens include silicon, asbestos, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, nickel, uranium...\n4. Changes in genetic genes\nThe fourth reason is that genetic mutations also increase the risk of melanoma. This risk increases if the patient is a smoker or exposed to other malignant tumor-causing substances.\n5. Undergo radiation therapy\nIf you have undergone radiation therapy to the chest for another type of cancer, the possibility of developing a malignant tumor in the respiratory system is possible.",
