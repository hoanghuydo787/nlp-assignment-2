    "subsection_content": "Cancer in the respiratory tract can cause serious complications, such as:\n1. Difficulty breathing\nLung tumor patients will have difficulty breathing if malignant cells develop and block the main airways. Lung cancer also causes fluid to build up around the lungs, making it difficult for the organ to fully expand when inhaled.\n2. Coughing up blood\nThe disease can cause bleeding in the respiratory tract, causing the patient to cough up blood.\n3. Pleural effusion\nThis phenomenon is explained by excessive fluid accumulation in the pleural cavity, spilling out into the space surrounding the lungs. As a result, patients sometimes feel short of breath.\n4. Metastasis\nThe tumor spreads to other parts of the body, such as the brain and bones, causing severe damage to these organs, causing pain, nausea, and other symptoms depending on the organ. affected. Once this tumor has spread beyond the lungs, the disease usually cannot be cured. All treatment methods are only aimed at reducing symptoms and prolonging the patient's life. (6)",
