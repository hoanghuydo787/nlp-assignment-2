The doctor will conduct a general health examination, then prescribe the following paraclinical tests:\nImaging: An abnormal tumor can be seen through X-rays, MRI, CT and PET.; Sputum test: If symptoms of cough with phlegm appear, the sputum will be examined using a microscope. This is one of the methods to determine whether there are cancer cells in it or not.\nIn addition, the doctor may ask the patient to perform a biopsy to check whether the tumor in this location is benign or malignant. Your doctor will take a tissue sample in one of the following ways:\nBronchoscopy: A flexible scope is inserted through the nose or mouth, down the throat and into the lungs.; Mediastinoscopy: The doctor opens a small incision inside the chest, then inserts instruments to take samples from the lymph nodes. When performing this procedure, the patient will be under general anesthesia.; Lung needle biopsy: Imaging diagnostic results are the basis for doctors to determine the tumor location. A biopsy needle is then inserted through the chest wall and into the lung tissue containing the tumor to obtain a sample.\nAfter analyzing the tissue samples, if the results are positive for cancer cells, the patient will be assigned other tests, such as bone scans, abdominal ultrasound, etc. to determine whether the cancer has occurred. Has it spread or not, what stage is it in?",
