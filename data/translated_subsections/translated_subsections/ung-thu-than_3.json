The disease is only detected during an ultrasound health check.\nOne in 10 people with kidney cancer has symptoms such as pain on one side of the body, a lump in the abdomen or blood in the urine. Signs that the disease may have progressed. Some people may also experience paraneoplastic syndromes. These are the body's reactions to any type of cancer such as high blood pressure, weight loss, fever, anemia, loss of muscle mass and loss of appetite.\nParaneoplastic syndromes often associated with kidney cancer include changes in liver enzymes and blood platelets. These changes are usually detected during blood tests and are usually asymptomatic.\nBone pain or a persistent cough can be signs that cancer has spread in the body. This is called metastatic disease.",
