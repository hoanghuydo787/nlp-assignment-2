    "subsection_content": "M.D. Nguyen Tan Cuong said, because there are many types of kidney tumors, doctors perform a series of assessments to better understand your condition. These assessments include: medical history, laboratory tests and computed tomography (CT) scans, and sometimes family history is also sought. A CT or MRI scan will evaluate the size of the tumor and invasion of veins, lymph nodes or surrounding organs, which is important for deciding on treatment. The doctor also performs examinations and gives the patient blood and urine tests.\nBased on the results of the patient's computed tomography scan, the urologist can determine the stage of the disease. By analyzing tumor tissue received during surgery or biopsy, the pathologist determines the subtype of the tumor, whether it is a rapidly progressive type or not. This classification is based on factors such as stage, subtype, and cellular malignancy of the tumor.\nKidney tumor classification is used to estimate prognosis. Based on this prognosis, the doctor will discuss the best treatment plan for the patient.\n“In some cases, people may need additional tests to check kidney function. This is very important if the patient only has one kidney or is at risk of kidney failure because of diabetes, high blood pressure, chronic infection or kidney disease,\" shared Dr. Nguyen Tan Cuong.\nImaging is important in the diagnosis and classification of renal tumors. The most common imaging techniques are ultrasound, CT scan, and MRI. In some cases, a biopsy is performed to better understand the specific characteristics of the tumor.\nCT scan of the urinary system with contrast agent injection\nAfter detecting a tumor, the doctor first needs to know whether the tumor is malignant or not. Computed tomography, or contrast-enhanced MRI of the abdomen and pelvis, provides a wealth of information such as:\nLocation and size of the tumor;; The size of the lymph nodes is large or small;; Whether the tumor has invaded nearby organs, such as the adrenal glands, liver, spleen or pancreas;; Is the urinary tract affected by tumors…\nContrast material is injected intravenously, usually in the patient's arm. Contrast material highlights veins and arteries with images of varying density and color. Depending on the type of survey, allows doctors to analyze tumor images. Concomitant results will inform the patient's treatment guidelines.\nIf you are allergic to contrast agents, you will have an MRI or CT scan without contrast enhancement.\nIf the doctor thinks the cancer may have spread to the lungs, the patient will have further tests, such as a chest CT scan. If the patient has symptoms such as bone pain or seizures, a bone or brain scan may be needed to check whether the cancer has spread to the bones or brain.\nKidney tumor biopsy\nA kidney tumor biopsy is the removal of one or more samples from the tumor. The patient is given local anesthesia, then the doctor will use a needle to penetrate the patient's skin and use ultrasound or CT to locate the tumor. Tissue samples are analyzed by a pathologist to help make a diagnosis and guide future treatment.\nKidney biopsy is not the standard method for diagnosing kidney cancer. Patients may need a biopsy in the following cases:\nYour imaging results are unclear;; You have a small tumor that can be monitored without surgery;; You have a small tumor that can be treated by destroying the tumor with radio waves or cryotherapy.\nMSc. Dr. Nguyen Tan Cuong noted: Normally, kidney tumor biopsy is a less harmful procedure but can also cause hematuria (blood in urine). In rare cases, bleeding can be more serious.",
