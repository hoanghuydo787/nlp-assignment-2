    "subsection_content": "Kidney tumors are classified according to stage, subtype, and degree of tumor cell malignancy. These three factors are the basis for you to come up with a treatment plan.\nStage assessment system\nTumor stage indicates how advanced the tumor is and whether or not it has metastasized, in lymph nodes or other organs.\nKidney tumor staging is based on the spread of the tumor and lymph nodes (TNM). The urologist evaluates the size and invasion of the tumor (T) and determines the degree of progression based on 4 stages. Lymph nodes that are affected (N) or cancer that has spread to any other part of the body (M) are also checked. If kidney tumors metastasize, they often spread to the lungs, or to the bones or brain.\nTumor classification\nBesides stage, the classification of the kidney tumor is important. The type of tumor is determined by the pathologist and this process is called histopathological analysis. The pathologist will look under a microscope at tumor tissue taken during a biopsy or after surgery. Kidney biopsy is not a standard procedure in diagnosing kidney cancer. In most cases, it is not possible to know the type of tumor before surgery.\nThere are many different types of kidney tumors, the most common being renal cell carcinoma. Of these, most are clear cell carcinomas.\n“If you are diagnosed with a rare kidney tumor, your doctor will provide detailed information about different treatment options. These treatments may be different from the treatments for common types of kidney cancer. At Tam Anh General Hospital, treatment options are discussed by a multidisciplinary team of experts, to find the best treatment for the patient,\" said MSc. Nguyen Tan Cuong.\nKidney cyst\nSome kidney tumors are not solid but are cysts, which are fluid-filled sacs in the kidney and are easily recognized on a CT scan. If the kidney cysts are potentially malignant, these cysts need to be removed surgically.\nFuhrman classification\nThe third component of classification is the assessment of the degree of malignancy of the tumor cells. Fuhrman nuclear classification is the most commonly used system to determine this. There are 4 groups according to the Fuhrman classification.",
