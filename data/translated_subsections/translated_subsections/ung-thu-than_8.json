Depending on your specific condition, choose the appropriate treatment method.\nIf you are diagnosed with locally advanced kidney cancer, your doctor may recommend radical nephrectomy or embolization.\nKidney tumors can metastasize to other organs or lymph nodes. This is called metastatic disease. In metastatic disease, kidney tumors are called primary tumors and tumors in other organs are called metastases. Your doctor may recommend treating metastatic disease with surgery, often in combination with angioantibiotic therapy, also known as targeted therapy. In rare cases, immunotherapy may also be used. To treat metastases, radiation therapy may be recommended.\nIn general, metastatic disease cannot be cured. The treatment of metastatic disease is aimed at reducing the size of the tumor and metastasis. This will give the patient the opportunity to live longer and have fewer symptoms.\nSometimes, people cannot recover after kidney cancer treatment. When treatment is no longer successful, patients may be offered palliative care to live more comfortably. Palliative care is a care concept with the goal of optimizing a person's quality of life if recovery is not possible.\nContact us now for advice and to schedule an examination with leading Andrology - Urology experts: TAM ANH GENERAL HOSPITAL SYSTEM Hanoi:  Address: 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Bo De Ward, Long Bien District, City.
