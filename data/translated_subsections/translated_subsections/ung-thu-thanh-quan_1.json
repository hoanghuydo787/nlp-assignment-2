    "subsection_content": "Classification of laryngeal cancer can be based on the location of the tumor. The larynx is divided into three layers: the supraglottis, the glottis and the subglottis. Accordingly, laryngeal cancer also includes the following 3 types: (7)\n1. Supraglottic cancer\nAbout 35% of laryngeal cancer cases start from this location. Supraglottic cancer often originates in the ventricular band and the lower surface of the epiglottis cartilage. In the early stages, cancer is difficult to determine because the activity of the base of the vocal folds and the two vocal cords are still normal. To diagnose, a CT or MRI scan is often required to assess the depth of infiltration of malignant cells.\n2. Glottic cancer\nThe glottis is the area that contains the vocal cords. Most laryngeal cancers start here (about 60%). This type of cancer progresses quite slowly. If malignant cells are located in the vocal cord epithelium, they are usually localized on one side for a long time before spreading to the other vocal cord.\n3. Subglottic cancer\nSubglottic cancer is a relatively rare cancer, accounting for only about 5% of all laryngeal cancer cases. This type of cancer is often infiltrative below the vocal cords, spreading deep below the mucosa, and is difficult to spread due to the barrier of the thyroid cartilage.\nFor subglottic cancer, diagnosis using indirect laryngoscopy makes it difficult to observe and approach the cancer, often requiring direct laryngoscopy. In some cases, the thyroid cartilage must even be opened to obtain a biopsy sample.\nIf not intervened promptly, subglottic cancer can spread quickly to the opposite side, spreading to the cricoid cartilage.\nIt can also grow above and behind the cricoid joint, affecting the functioning of the vocal cords.",
