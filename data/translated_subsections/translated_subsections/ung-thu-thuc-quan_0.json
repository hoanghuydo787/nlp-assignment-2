    "subsection_content": "The esophagus is a component of the digestive tract (also known as the digestive tract or intestines). The digestive system includes: mouth, throat, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon (large intestine), rectum and anus. The digestive system has the role of receiving, transporting and decomposing food, absorbing nutrients, and removing waste from the body.\nThe esophagus has a tubular structure, about 25cm long and about 2.5cm wide. When swallowing food from the mouth, thanks to the contractions of the digestive tract (called peristalsis), along with the impact of gravity, the food will move through the esophagus and reach the stomach. The esophagus is located behind the trachea (airway) and in front of the spine. The esophagus is divided into 3 segments: upper, middle, lower.\nEsophageal cancer appears when cells in the esophagus grow abnormally and uncontrollably, including 2 main types: (1)\nSquamous cell carcinoma (also known as squamous cell): commonly found in the upper and middle esophagus, common in Asians and Eastern Europeans.; Adenocarcinoma: commonly found in the lower esophagus, but can also occur in the middle esophagus. The adenocarcinoma type is common in North Americans and Western Europeans.\nLess common forms of esophageal cancer include: sarcoma, lymphoma, small cell carcinoma, melanoma... In addition, cancer from other organs can also metastasize to the esophagus, accounting for 3%. number of recorded cases of esophageal cancer. Cancers that can metastasize to the esophagus include melanoma, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, lung, stomach, liver, kidney, prostate, testicles, bone...",
