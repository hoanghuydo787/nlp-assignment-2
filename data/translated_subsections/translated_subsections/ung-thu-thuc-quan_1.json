The disease can stem from the following risk factors: (2)\nDrinking habits: This is the leading factor that increases the risk of esophageal cancer. People who have the habit of using alcoholic beverages, especially strong alcohol, for a long time have a high risk of esophageal cancer. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has issued a joint statement on the association between alcohol consumption and cancer risk to warn of the consequences of long-term alcohol use.; Smoking: Along with the habit of drinking alcohol, smoking is the leading risk of esophageal cancer, including active smoking (people who smoke directly) and passive smoking (people exposed to cigarette smoke). leaves). In addition to esophageal cancer, smoking also increases the risk of other cancers such as head and neck cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer...; Diet:  Use foods containing Nitrosamine such as pickles, salted fish, canned foods... or some types of mushrooms that produce toxins such as Aflatoxin. Drinks and foods processed at high temperatures: using foods processed at high temperatures above 60 degrees Celsius can increase the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma because high temperatures cause mucosal damage. esophageal membrane. Habit of chewing betel and areca nuts: the habit of chewing betel and areca nuts in some Asian countries, including Vietnam, can cause esophageal cancer. The diet lacks fiber and vitamins from vegetables and fruits; Use foods containing Nitrosamine such as pickles, salted fish, canned foods... or some types of mushrooms that produce toxins such as Aflatoxin.; Drinks and foods processed at high temperatures: using foods processed at high temperatures above 60 degrees Celsius can increase the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma because high temperatures cause mucosal damage. esophageal fascia.; Habit of chewing betel and areca nut: the habit of chewing betel and areca nuts in some Asian countries, including Vietnam, can cause esophageal cancer.; The diet lacks fiber and vitamins from vegetables and fruits; Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD - Gastrointestinal reflux disease) and Barrett's esophagus: People with GERD have a higher risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma than normal people. At the same time, if gastric acid reflux into the esophagus persists, the esophageal mucosa will be damaged and the esophageal mucosal cells will change their structural properties (called metaplasia), leading to disease. Barrett's esophagus. People with Barrett's esophagus have a 30-fold increased risk of esophageal cancer compared to the general population.; People with GERD have a higher risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma than normal people.

Barrett's esophagus. People with Barrett's esophagus have a 30-fold increased risk of esophageal cancer compared to the general population.; Obesity: Being overweight or obese can increase the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. This may be because obese people are more likely to have gastroesophageal reflux disease.; Human papilloma virus (HPV - Human Papilloma Virus) infection: HPV is a virus that can cause tissue changes in the larynx, oral cavity, genitals... Mechanism of HPV leading to esophageal cancer still not well understood, may be related to Barrett's esophagus.; History of gastric bypass: Patients who have had part of their stomach removed are at risk of esophageal cancer.; Atrophic gastritis: This condition increases the risk of esophageal cancer by 2 times.; Other diseases/damages of the esophagus: Some diseases such as Achalasia (achalasia) increase the risk of esophageal cancer 16 times, or people with esophageal burns due to chemicals (such as laundry detergent). It is also possible to develop esophageal cancer many years later.; History of other cancers: Cancers of the nasopharynx, oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx cancer, lung cancer... also increase the risk of esophageal cancer.; Genetic factors: Familial Barrett's esophagus, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Bloom syndrome, Fanconi anemia, Tylosis (a rare genetic disease causing hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles)...\nOverweight-obese people have a higher risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma than non-overweight-obese people.",
