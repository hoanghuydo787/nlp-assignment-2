    "subsection_content": "According to the 2017 American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification system, esophageal cancer is staged based on the following 3 factors:\nT (Tumor): Depending on the level of invasion of the tumor, T will be staged as follows: TX: Esophageal tumor cannot be evaluated. T0: No esophageal tumor detected. Tis: Severe dysplasia, cancer cells are still localized in the epithelial layer, have not invaded the basement membrane. T1: Cancer invades the basement membrane, mucosa, and submucosa. T2: Cancer invades the muscle layer. T3: Cancer invades the lining (outermost layer of the esophagus). T4: Cancer invades nearby organs, including the pleura, pericardium, simple vein, diaphragm, peritoneum (abdomen), aorta, spine, airways.; TX: Esophageal tumor cannot be evaluated.; T0: No esophageal tumor recorded.; Tis: Severe dysplasia, cancer cells are still localized in the epithelial layer, have not invaded the basement membrane.; T1: Cancer invades the basement membrane, muscle mucosa, submucosa.; T2: Cancer invades the muscle layer; T3: Cancer invades the lining (outermost layer of the esophagus).; T4: Cancer invades nearby organs, including the pleura, pericardium, simple vein, diaphragm, peritoneum (abdomen), aorta, spine, airways.; N (Node - Lymph node metastasis): Number of neighboring lymph nodes metastasized (also known as regional lymph node metastasis) N0: No regional lymph node metastasis. N1: Metastasis in 1-2 regional lymph nodes. N2: Metastasis in 3-6 regional lymph nodes. N3: Metastasis in ≥ 7 regional lymph nodes; N0: No regional lymph node metastasis; N1: Metastasis in 1-2 regional lymph nodes; N2: Metastasis in 3-6 regional lymph nodes; N3: Metastasis in ≥ 7 regional lymph nodes; M (Metastasis - Distant metastasis): Condition of distant metastasis to other organs in the body such as lungs, liver, brain, bones... or metastasis to lymph nodes other than regional lymph nodes. M0: No distant metastasis. M1: Distant metastasis.; M0: No distant metastasis; M1: Distant metastasis.\nBased on 3 factors T, N, M, esophageal cancer is staged as follows:\nStage 0: Tis, N0, M0.; Stage I: T1, N0-1, M0.; Stage II: T2, N0-1, M0 or T3, N0, M0.; Stage III: T3, N1, M0 or T1-2, N2, M0.; Stage IVA: T4, N0-2, M0 or any T, N3, M0.; Stage IVB: Any T, Any N, M1.",
