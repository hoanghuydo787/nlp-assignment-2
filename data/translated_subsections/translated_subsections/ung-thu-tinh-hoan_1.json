    "subsection_content": "The cause of testicular cancer has not yet been found. Basically, testicular cancer occurs when healthy cells in the testicles mutate. Most testicular cancers start in germ cells. These are cells in the testicles that produce immature sperm. However, what causes germ cells to become abnormal and develop into cancer is still unanswered.\nThe following factors can increase the risk of testicular cancer in men:\nUndescended testicles: In the fetus, the testicles will be located in the abdominal cavity. Before a boy is born, this organ will gradually move through the inguinal canal to the scrotum. Undescended testicles appear when the testicles have problems descending from the abdomen to the scrotum. Because the temperature of the abdomen is higher than the temperature in the scrotum, the testicles located in the abdomen are susceptible to degeneration, causing infertility. This disorder increases the risk of testicular cancer. The risk remains increased even if the testicle has been surgically moved to the scrotum.; Abnormal testicles: There are a number of reasons why the testicles develop abnormally, potentially increasing the risk of testicular cancer.; Family history: When family members have had testicular cancer, men have a relatively high risk of developing the disease.; Age: Testicular cancer affects teenagers and young men, especially those aged 15 - 35. However, the disease can still appear at any age.\nRace: Men of any race are at risk of testicular cancer.",
