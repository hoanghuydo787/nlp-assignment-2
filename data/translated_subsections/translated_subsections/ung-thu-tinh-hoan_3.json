    "subsection_content": "To determine whether a tumor in the testicle is cancerous or not, the doctor may prescribe the patient to undergo tests such as:\n1. Ultrasound\nTesticular ultrasound is a method that uses sound waves to create images of the scrotum and testicles. During the ultrasound, the patient will lie on their back and spread their legs wide. The doctor will apply specialized gel to the patient's scrotum to help make the ultrasound image clearer. A handheld probe is moved through the scrotum to create ultrasound images. An ultrasound will help your doctor determine the nature of the testicular tumor (whether the tumor is solid or filled with fluid). This imaging diagnosis also helps doctors determine whether the tumor is inside or outside the testicles.\n2. Blood test\nThe doctor may prescribe the patient a blood test to determine cancer markers in the patient's blood. Cancer markers are substances that are normally present in your blood. However, levels of these substances are likely to increase in certain diseases, including testicular cancer. High levels of cancer markers in the blood do not mean you have cancer. However, it can help doctors guide the diagnosis.\n3. Surgical removal of one testicle\nWhen it is certain that the tumor is cancerous, the doctor may prescribe surgery to remove the testicle. The removed testicles will be analyzed. Your doctor will determine whether the tumor is cancerous and, if so, what type of cancer it is.\n3.1 Determine the type of cancer\nThe testicles are removed or biopsied and will be analyzed to determine the type of testicular cancer. This determination will help the doctor provide appropriate treatment and prognosis. There are two types of testicular cancer:\nGerm cell tumor (Seminoma): This is a germ cell tumor of the testicles, a treatable malignant tumor. This tumor occurs at all ages. If an elderly person has testicular cancer, the risk of that person getting a seminoma is very high.; Non-germ cell tumor (Nonseminoma): Includes cancers that are not seminoma. Nonseminoma is often discovered in men at a young age. These tumors often develop in young men and spread very quickly. Some types of nonseminoma tumors such as embryonal carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, teratoma, and yolk sac tumor.\n3.2 Cancer stage\nOnce the doctor has accurately diagnosed the patient with cancer, the next step is to determine the stage of the cancer. To determine whether the cancer has spread outside the testicles or not, the patient may be prescribed a number of tests such as:\nComputed tomography (CT) to look for signs that the cancer has spread; Blood test: This test evaluates for elevated cancer markers.",
