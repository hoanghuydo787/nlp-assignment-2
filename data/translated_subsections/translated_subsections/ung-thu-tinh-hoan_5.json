    "subsection_content": "1. Surgery\nSurgery is indicated in cases such as:\nOrchiectomy: This is the main treatment for most stages and types of testicular cancer.; Surgical removal of nearby lymph nodes: This treatment is performed through an incision in the abdomen. The doctor will be careful during surgical operations to avoid damaging the nerves surrounding the lymph nodes. However, some cases still cannot avoid nerve damage. Damaged nerves can cause difficulty in ejaculation, affecting the erection of the penis.\n2. Lymph node curettage\nIf orchiectomy surgery cannot completely remove cancer cells that have metastasized to lymph nodes, the patient needs to continue this surgery. The doctor may perform lymph node dissection at the same time or after orchiectomy if the cancer is later detected.\n3. Radiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a method that uses powerful beams of energy, such as X-rays, to destroy cancer cells. During radiotherapy, the patient will lie on a table. A large machine moves around the body to aim beams of energy at predetermined points on the patient's body. Radiation therapy can be performed alone or after the patient has had orchiectomy.\nSome side effects of radiotherapy that patients may experience include nausea, fatigue, skin redness and irritation in the abdomen and groin. This treatment also has the potential to reduce sperm count, affecting fertility in some men. Therefore, you should talk to your doctor about sperm preservation before radiotherapy.\n4. Chemotherapy\nThis is a treatment that uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs will travel throughout the patient's body to destroy cancer cells that have spread from the original tumor. Chemotherapy is often prescribed alone for treatment or may be prescribed before/after lymphadenectomy.\nSide effects of this treatment will depend on the specific medication the patient is taking. Common side effects are fatigue, hair loss, nausea, increased risk of infection... In addition, chemotherapy can also lead to infertility in some men. Some cases may be permanent. Therefore, if patients want to have children, they need to discuss carefully with their doctor about how to preserve sperm before chemotherapy.",
