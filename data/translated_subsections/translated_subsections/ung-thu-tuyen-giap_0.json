    "subsection_content": "Thyroid cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancerous) cells form from cells of the thyroid gland. This is a common type of cancer that tends to develop with increasing age, and the risk in women is higher than in men.\nThe thyroid gland is an important endocrine gland located in the anterior neck, in front of the trachea. It consists of two butterfly-shaped lobes and a waist connecting them. The thyroid gland absorbs iodine to synthesize and secrete thyroid hormones that participate in the body's basic metabolism, affecting heart rate, organ activity, etc.\nIf the thyroid gland produces too much or too little hormone, it can lead to medical problems. These states are called hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism respectively.\nThe number of people with thyroid cancer is increasing day by day. There are two types of thyroid cancer: differentiated thyroid cancer (papillary, follicular, about 90%) and other types (medullary, undifferentiated about 10%). Differentiated thyroid cancer can be completely cured. (first)",
