It can also metastasize to the lungs and bones.\nIn addition, surgical treatment of thyroid cancer can also cause complications. This is partly because neck surgery can cause changes.\nPossible complications include:\nHypothyroidism.; Dysphagia due to damage to the superior laryngeal nerve; Vocal cord paralysis due to recurrent laryngeal nerve damage; Hypoparathyroidism due to parathyroidectomy.\nUsing radioactive drugs can have the following consequences:\nRadiation thyroiditis and transient thyrotoxicosis in patients who have undergone simple lobectomy.; Nausea, vomiting, anorexia and headache (uncommon).; Pulmonary fibrosis in patients with large lung metastases.; Cerebral edema in patients with brain metastases.; Affects fertility, transient hypoplasia or irregular menstruation; Slightly increased risk of leukemia or carcinoma of the breast and bladder.; The most serious complications are metastasis and death. The most frequent metastatic sites are the lungs and bones, followed by the brain and liver. The tumor can also metastasize to other locations in the body.\nSee more: Is thyroid cancer dangerous?
