Clinical diagnosis\nThe doctor can check and examine the neck area: Thyroid gland, cervical lymph nodes, and ask about the patient's and family's medical history.\nUltrasound is one of the techniques for diagnosing thyroid cancer\n7.2. Diagnostic tests\nThe doctor will prescribe diagnostic tests including: (3)\nUltrasound of the thyroid gland and cervical lymph nodes: Detect and evaluate the location, size, nature, and number of thyroid tumors and cervical lymph nodes.; Cytological testing of thyroid tumors and cervical lymph nodes under ultrasound guidance (fine needle aspiration - FNA): A needle is inserted through the skin into the thyroid gland to remove some cells from the tumor and from the cervical lymph nodes. The doctor will examine the cells under a microscope to look for cancer cells.; CT scan and MRI of the neck: Further evaluate the level of invasion of thyroid tumors and lymph nodes with surrounding organs such as soft tissue of the neck, trachea, and esophagus.; Immediate biopsy during surgery: The doctor will remove a thyroid nodule or a lobe of the thyroid gland during surgery, and do histopathology testing right during surgery for timely and appropriate treatment.; Biomarkers: For differentiated thyroid cancer after surgery, the Tg index will be used to evaluate treatment and monitor recurrence; With medullary thyroid cancer, Calcitonin and CEA indexes play a role in prognosis and post-treatment monitoring.\nDoctor Hai Binh shared: \"At Tam Anh General Hospital, when patients come for examination, the doctor will do a clinical examination, ask about risk factors and family history. After that, the doctor will perform an ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland, assessing the location and size of the tumor, the invasiveness of the thyroid tumor, and whether or not the cervical lymph nodes have metastasized. The patient will have thyroid tumor cells aspirated under the guidance of ultrasound and cytological testing to determine whether they are thyroid cancer or not.",
