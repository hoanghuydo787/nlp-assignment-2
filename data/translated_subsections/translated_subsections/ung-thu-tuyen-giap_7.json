    "subsection_content": "According to Dr. Hai Binh, there are many different treatment options for differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid cancer. The appropriate form of treatment will depend on the stage and type of thyroid cancer the patient has. Differentiated thyroid cancer is the most common type with a rate of about 90% and can be completely cured.\nTreatments for thyroid cancer include surgery, radioactive iodine therapy (I-131), targeted drugs (tyrosine kinase inhibitors – TKIs), and hormone therapy. Treatment methods will depend on the stage of the disease and histopathology...\nThyroid cancer treatments typically include: (4)\n8.1. Surgical removal of a lobe of the thyroid gland or complete thyroidectomy\nThe choice of surgery to remove only one thyroid lobe or complete thyroidectomy and neck lymph node dissection depends on the stage of the disease being assessed before deciding on treatment.\nDoctor Hai Binh said that at Tam Anh General Hospital, surgery to remove thyroid lobes with tumors in early-stage cases preserves one side of the thyroid lobe, bringing better quality of life to the patient. For patients with larger tumors and cervical lymph node metastases, surgery to remove the entire thyroid gland, dissection of the neck lymph nodes, and then consider whether an additional dose of radioactive drug Iodine 131 may be needed. After resection thyroid gland, the patient will no longer have thyroid hormone, so the doctor will give him thyroid hormone to compensate for the rest of his life.\n8.2. Radioactive iodine therapy (131I)\nRadioactive iodine (131I) therapy plays an important role in the treatment and control of thyroid cancer. This method is combined with thyroidectomy to remove remaining cancer cells after surgery.\nRadioactive iodine will be absorbed by thyroid cancer cells and emit beta radiation that kills them.\n8.3. Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors\nTyrosine Kinase Inhibitors target tyrosine kinase signaling pathways, including the RET, RAF or RAS protein kinase genes to help control disease progression. Drugs used to treat metastatic and progressive differentiated thyroid cancer are: Sorafenib, Lenvatinib,...\n8.4. Thyroid hormone therapy\nAfter completely removing the thyroid gland, the patient will be prescribed thyroid hormone medication for life. In addition to supplementing the body with thyroid hormones, thyroid hormone drugs also inhibit the recurrence of thyroid cancer cells.",
