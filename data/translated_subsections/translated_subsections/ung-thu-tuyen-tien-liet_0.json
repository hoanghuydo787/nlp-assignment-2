    "subsection_content": "Prostate cancer or prostate cancer is a common disease in men, especially over the age of 50.\nThe prostate is a sexual organ found only in men, weighing about 20 - 25 grams. The size of this organ changes with age, growing from puberty and stabilizing at age 30, then continuing to grow larger as men age. The prostate is located below the bladder and above the rectum, next to the seminal vesicles. The urinary tract (Uretha) passes through the center of the prostate, out of the penis). The prostate is responsible for creating semen.\nAbnormal, uncontrolled growth of prostate cells will form malignant tumors here, leading to prostate cancer. The disease often develops very slowly and there are no pathological symptoms in the early stages.\nIn Vietnam, the number of people visiting andrologists for prostate disease has increased, but prostate cancer has not received adequate attention. In addition, the conditions for diagnosing and detecting diseases at medical facilities are not fully equipped, which is the reason why patients often only go to the hospital when the disease is in the late stages. This makes treatment very difficult and potentially fatal.",
