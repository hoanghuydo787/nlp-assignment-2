    "subsection_content": "1. How long can prostate cancer patients live?\nDue to the influence of many factors such as the level of cancer development, age, current health status, underlying disease, etc., each patient's prognosis will be different. For example, a 70-year-old patient with stage 0, 1 or 2 underlying disease and living normally can live another 18 years. However, at the same age, if the patient has at least one stage 3 underlying disease and needs help with daily activities, the life expectancy will decrease to about 12 years.\n2. Can late-stage prostate cancer be cured?\nLate-stage cancer can still be cured. However, it should be noted that the purpose of treating the disease at this stage is to slow down the progression of cancer and prolong the patient's lifespan, not to completely cure it like in the early stages.\n3. How to detect prostate cancer early?\nCancer screening is a testing method to detect disease before the patient has pathological symptoms. To detect prostate cancer in its early stages, only a blood test can be done to check the level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In addition, a digital rectal exam is also a relatively accurate way to determine whether the prostate is abnormally large or not.\nTo schedule an examination with specialists in the Department of Urology - Tam Anh General Hospital, customers can fill out information here, or contact Tam Anh General Hospital System:\nIn Hanoi: 108 Hoang Nhu Tiep, Bo De Ward, Long Bien District, Hanoi.
