However, the disease has been shown to have a close relationship with a number of factors as follows, including:\n1. Age\nThe older a man is, the more susceptible he is to prostate cancer. Only 10% of cases are detected under the age of 54, but the number increases to 65% in the 55-74 age group.\n2. Race\nThe risk of black men getting prostate cancer is higher than that of white people of the same age. Asians have a lower incidence than blacks and whites.\n3. Family medical history\nIn cases where a father or brother has a history of the disease, the risk of getting the disease is up to 2-3 times.\n4. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN)\nPIN is related to the risk of cancer, 25.8% รท 51% of highly differentiated PIN develop into prostate cancer.\n5. Some other factors\nCurrently, research has clarified many issues about pathogenesis. The causes are related to a number of genes in the process of generation and development of cancer cells and risk factors such as environment, exposure to chemicals, diet (eating a lot of red meat, eat few vegetables), obesity, smoking, sexually transmitted diseases, prostatitis, vasectomy...",
