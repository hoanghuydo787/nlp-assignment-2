    "subsection_content": "Prostate cancer is a dangerous disease because if not treated promptly, the patient will face many unpredictable complications, such as:\n1. Metastatic prostate cancer\nOver time, malignant prostate tumors can metastasize to nearby organs, blood vessels or lymphatic systems. The tumor can even metastasize to bones, causing pain and fractures.\nOnce metastasized, the disease can still respond to treatment and be well controlled but cannot be completely cured.\n2. Urinary incontinence\nProstate cancer itself and its treatments can lead to urinary incontinence. The solution to this situation will depend on the type of disease at hand, its severity, and the likelihood of improvement over time. Treatment options include medications, catheters, or surgery.\n3. Erectile dysfunction\nThese may be complications of the disease or side effects of treatment regimens, usually surgery, radiation therapy, or hormonal therapy. This condition can be improved with medication or surgery.\nSee more: Erectile dysfunction: Causes, symptoms",
