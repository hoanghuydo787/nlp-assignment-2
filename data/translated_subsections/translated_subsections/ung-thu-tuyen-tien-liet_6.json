    "subsection_content": "First, the doctor will examine the rectum to detect signs of prostate abnormalities. After that, the patient will be assigned to perform some more in-depth tests such as:\n1. PSA blood test\nThe PSA (prostate specific antigen) test is used to quantify the concentration of prostate specific antigen in the blood. Normally, the PSA value is below 4ng/mL and the ratio of free PSA to total PSA is above 20%. If PSA is elevated above 4ng/mL and the free/total PSA ratio is below 15%, the risk of disease is very high.\nCurrently, the PSA test is considered the most effective in diagnosing prostate cancer. The practical application of PSA testing has significantly increased efficiency in screening, diagnosing and monitoring disease treatment.\n2. Biopsy\nWhen the prostate examination shows signs of abnormality, the patient will have a prostate biopsy to find cancer cells and evaluate the tumor's level of malignancy. A biopsy can be performed with local anesthesia.\n3. Imaging diagnosis\nOnce there is a diagnosis of malignant prostate tumor, the patient needs to have a bone scan and pelvic MRI to assess the stage of the cancer. This diagnosis is to determine whether cancer cells have metastasized to lymph nodes or to the bones.",
