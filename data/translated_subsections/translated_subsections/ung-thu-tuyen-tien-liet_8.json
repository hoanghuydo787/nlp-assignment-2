    "subsection_content": "In general, prostate cancer can be treated with the following methods:\n1. Radical prostatectomy\nThis treatment method is indicated for early stage 1 or 2 cancer cases, and it is estimated that patients can live more than 10 years. The cancer cells are still localized and have not broken through the capsule of the gland. If surgery can remove all of them to the safe margin (the surgical margin has no cancerous tissue left), the likelihood of recurrence at 5 years after surgery is about less than 10%.\nRadical prostatectomy can be performed by laparoscopic surgery or open surgery below the umbilicus. The doctor will remove the entire prostate, seminal vesicles and tissue around the prostate.\nThe most common postoperative complications are complete urinary incontinence (5-10%), erectile dysfunction (70%).\nAt Tam Anh General Hospital System, doctors often apply laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with the purpose of helping patients reduce pain and recover quickly.\n2. External radiation therapy\nThis method uses high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells in the prostate. Treatment period lasts 6-7 weeks. This method is indicated for late-stage cancer cases (mainly stages 3 and 4).\nCommon side effects after radiotherapy are fatigue, digestive disorders, urinary symptoms, erectile dysfunction...\n3. Prostate ablation with focused ultrasound (HIFU)\nThis is a solution that uses ultrasound waves (placed in the rectum) to destroy cancer cells with heat. This method is suitable for patients with early stage cancer but do not accept the risks and complications of surgery.\nPatients who are indicated for radiotherapy and do not accept it can also undergo trial treatment with HIFU, but the likelihood of recurrence will be higher than with external radiotherapy.\nCommon complications after HIFU are urethral stenosis, bladder neck stenosis...\n4. Hormonal treatment\nEndocrine treatment is only applied to patients with lymph node metastases or distant metastases. Patients can choose between surgery to remove both testicles or using injections (every 28 days, continuously for at least 6 - 12 months). The main purpose is to cut off the supply of testosterone so that cancer cells cannot continue to grow.",
