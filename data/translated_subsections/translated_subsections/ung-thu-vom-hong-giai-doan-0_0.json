    "subsection_content": "Stage 0 nasopharyngeal cancer is the earliest stage of nasopharyngeal cancer, also known as carcinoma in situ (CIS).\nNasopharynx cancer is a type of cancer that originates in the nasopharynx (nasopharynx is the area located at the top of the throat, behind the nasal cavity and near the base of the skull, connecting the nose with the lower part of the throat).\nAt stage 0, the tumor is only limited to the surface layer, has not grown deeper, and cancer cells have not metastasized to lymph nodes and distant organs.\nBased on the TNM staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), nasopharyngeal cancer is divided into stages 0-4. Among them, stage 0 is the earliest stage.\nImage of the nasopharynx.

Lymph nodes near the original tumor site are called regional lymph nodes. Lymph nodes outside the regional lymph node area are classified as distant metastases.\nFor people with nasopharyngeal cancer, doctors will check the lymph nodes in the neck on both sides, including the lymph nodes under the chin, under the jaw, behind the neck, behind the ear, along the sternocleidomastoid muscle and lymph nodes. on the blow.\nN0 (N zero): No regional lymph node metastasis; Metastasis (M): The letter “M” in the TNM system indicates whether there has been distant metastasis to other organs; M0 (M zero): Cancer has not spread to other parts of the body.\nThus, stage 0 is carcinoma in situ, has not spread to lymph nodes and has not spread to other parts of the body (Tis, N0, M0).
