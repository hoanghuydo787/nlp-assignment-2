This tissue sample will be evaluated by pathologists to detect cancer cells.\nComputed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and neck\nThis method is indicated to evaluate local tumor characteristics and regional lymph node metastasis.\nPET-CT, or CT of other areas of the body\nThis technique can be used to evaluate whether the tumor has metastasized to other organs or not.",
