At this stage, although the cancer has not metastasized to nearby lymph nodes, these nodes often still need radiotherapy. Because these lymph nodes may have metastasized cancer cells but cannot be detected during examination nor can they be detected on CT/MRI images.\nWithout radiation therapy, cancer cells in the lymph nodes will continue to grow and may spread to other organs.\nDuring treatment, patients need to follow the specialist's instructions. At the end of treatment, patients need to comply with the follow-up appointment. Abandonment of treatment or combination with folk methods of unknown mechanism makes nasopharyngeal cancer progress more seriously.\n“Patients should not follow any diet without a doctor's prescription.
