    "subsection_content": "Stage 1 nasopharyngeal cancer is a disease in which the tumor's growth is limited to the nasopharynx. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), each year there are about 133,000 new cases and more than 80,000 deaths due to nasopharyngeal cancer. Areas recording medium and high numbers of nasopharyngeal cancer cases include countries in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, with a rate of 25/100,000 people. In general, men are 2-3 times more likely to get nasopharyngeal cancer than women.\nThe rate of nasopharyngeal cancer in men is 2-3 times higher than in women.\nAccording to MSc Luu Thao Ngoc, Department of Oncology, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, the pathogenesis is believed to be related to the development of nasopharyngeal cancer including:\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection: EBV virus is a risk factor accounting for up to 90% of cases, and is the main etiological agent in the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal cancer.; HPV papilloma virus infection: This is the pathogenesis mentioned in post-EBV nasopharyngeal cancer, accounting for about 10% of cases due to infection with the Epstein-Barr virus.; Use of tobacco and alcohol: Excessive alcohol abuse and smoking can be the cause of nasopharyngeal cancer as well as stimulate EBV reactivation.; Genetic factors: If a first-degree relative has been diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer in the family, the risk of developing nasopharyngeal cancer will be 7 times higher than that of a person with no family history of the disease.; Improper nutrition: Diet low in fiber, abuse of silage and fermented foods (such as salted fish, salted meat, salted eggs, pickled sauerkraut...) with high nitrosamine content as well as other substances. mutagenic, direct genotoxic and EBV reactivating agents; Working in an unsafe environment: Employees often work in areas with a lot of toxic dust, wood dust, formaldehyde chemicals, radiation exposure...",
