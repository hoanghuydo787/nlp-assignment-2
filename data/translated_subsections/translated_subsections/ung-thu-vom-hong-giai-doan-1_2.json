The disease is often confused with symptoms of common respiratory diseases, even without symptoms or inaccurate diagnosis leading to patient subjectivity. As a result, the disease is only detected when nasopharyngeal cancer reaches an advanced stage and metastasizes, making treatment difficult as well as painful for the patient.\nSymptoms of stage 1 nasopharyngeal cancer are often non-specific or symptoms are often mild such as nasal symptoms (such as stuffy nose, nosebleed, nasal congestion, etc.), or symptoms in the oropharynx such as sore throat. ,...
