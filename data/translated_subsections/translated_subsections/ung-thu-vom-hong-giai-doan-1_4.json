    "subsection_content": "After a clinical examination and medical history, a number of indications will be made by the doctor to evaluate a patient with ENT symptoms:\nENT endoscopy: uses modern specialized instruments to detect abnormalities in the nasopharynx. Endoscopy helps to observe the nasopharyngeal mucosa to find abnormalities. Through endoscopy, the doctor can prescribe a biopsy of a small sample of the tumor for pathology testing when malignancy is suspected.\nEar, nose and throat endoscopy helps detect nasopharyngeal cancer at an early stage\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Compared with CT, MRI helps evaluate the tumor condition, invades surrounding soft tissues better, helps diagnose the stage of the disease as well as in planning tumor radiotherapy when with indication.; Computed tomography (CT) or PET/CT: This technique aims to accurately determine the size, shape, degree of invasion of the tumor to surrounding tissue areas, and the status of distant metastases to organs. other organs such as bones, lungs,...; Analysis of EBV DNA in plasma: EBV DNA in plasma serves as a marker to evaluate the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal cancer. Evaluating EBV DNA before and after treatment has prognostic value for patients with nasopharyngeal cancer, especially when EBV DNA levels in the blood remain high after treatment, indicating a high risk of disease recurrence and distant metastasis. , thereby orienting the choice of subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy.\nMagnetic resonance imaging helps evaluate the tumor condition to plan treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer",
