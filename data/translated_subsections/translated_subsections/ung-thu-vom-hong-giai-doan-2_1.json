    "subsection_content": "Based on the classification system commonly used in assessing the stage of nasopharyngeal cancer by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), based on 3 main information including: (2)\nTumor (T): size, invasive nature of the tumor with surrounding structures; Metastasis to neighboring lymph nodes (N): evaluate whether or not there is metastasis to regional lymph nodes; Distant metastasis (M): has the cancer spread to other organs of the body? Common sites of metastasis include bones, lungs, and liver.\nStage 2 nasopharyngeal cancer can be divided into 2 cases: (3)\nThe first case is when the disease is limited to the nasopharynx, can grow into the oropharynx, nasal cavity without invading the peripharyngeal area, may not have metastasized to lymph nodes or metastasized to retropharyngeal lymph nodes (T2N0M0 , T2N1M0 according to AJCC/UICC classification);; In cases where the disease has metastasized to lymph nodes on one side of the neck, the lymph nodes are less than 6cm in size and located on the cricoid cartilage (an anatomical location of the head, face and neck area) and the disease has not metastasized far (T0N1M0, T1N1M0 according to the AJCC/classification).
