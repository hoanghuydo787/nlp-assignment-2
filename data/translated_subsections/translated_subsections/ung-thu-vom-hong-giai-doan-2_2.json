    "subsection_content": "MSc. Luu Thao Ngoc, Department of Oncology, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, said that the symptoms of stage 2 nasopharyngeal cancer (localized stage) are often more obvious than stage 1 nasopharyngeal cancer. The disease may experience symptoms such as:\n1. Symptoms of the nose and sinuses\nNasal congestion symptoms may appear along with headaches. Nasal congestion may gradually increase in severity and frequency, and mucus, blood or pus may flow.\n2. Symptoms in the ear area\nUncomfortable feelings in the ear area such as pain, tinnitus, hearing loss. Some cases of serous otitis media are caused by superinfection.\n3. Swollen neck lymph nodes\nLymph node masses appear clearly in stage 2 of nasopharyngeal cancer. It is possible that a lymph node or lymph node mass may initially be small in size, then gradually grow larger, possibly reaching a size of up to 6 cm. The lymph nodes are hard, painless when pressed, and rarely mobile. The lymph nodes are usually located on one side of the neck (left cervical lymph nodes or right cervical lymph nodes). A group of metastatic lymph nodes that are often only detected on CT/MRI scans are the retropharyngeal lymph nodes.\nSwollen neck lymph nodes are one of the symptoms of stage 2 nasopharyngeal cancer",
