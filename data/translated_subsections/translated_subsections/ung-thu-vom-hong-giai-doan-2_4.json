    "subsection_content": "The process of diagnosing nasopharyngeal cancer in general and stage 2 nasopharyngeal cancer in particular is often determined as follows:\n1. Clinical examination\nWhen the patient goes for a health check-up because of the appearance of lymph nodes in the neck. Normally, the doctor will conduct an examination and take medical history.\nDuring a clinical examination, the doctor will evaluate manifestations in other organs such as the throat, nose, ears, mouth, tongue, etc. In case the signs indicate the risk of cancer, the patient will be prescribed Perform tests and diagnostic imaging such as CT, MRI...\n3. Endoscopic examination of the nasopharynx and biopsy\nUsing an ENT endoscopy procedure, the doctor inserts a specialized endoscope to check for abnormalities in the ear, nose, and throat area. When evaluating any abnormalities, the doctor may prescribe a biopsy of the lesion through ENT endoscopy. The specimen will be taken and sent to the pathology department to evaluate whether the lesion is cancerous. letter or not…\nEar-nose-throat endoscopy is a method to support the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal cancer\nIf a tumor is suspected to be growing under the nasopharyngeal mucosa, endoscopic visualization may be more difficult. Therefore, the patient will be prescribed additional imaging diagnostics such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)...\n3. Imaging diagnosis – Nuclear medicine\nPerforming diagnostic imaging such as chest X-ray, neck lymph node ultrasound, CT/MRI scan is an effective way to determine the location and extent of tumor invasion with surrounding healthy tissues. An advanced technique often used in disease staging is PET/CT, the results of this technique will help assess whether the disease has metastasized distantly or is still local. The step of accurately assessing the stage is very important for predicting the disease, guiding the selection of appropriate treatment methods, bringing the highest effectiveness to the patient.",
