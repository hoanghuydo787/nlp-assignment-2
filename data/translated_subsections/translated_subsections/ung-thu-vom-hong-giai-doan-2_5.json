    "subsection_content": "MSc. Dr. Luu Thao Ngoc said that the fundamental treatment method for stage 2 nasopharyngeal cancer is radiotherapy and chemotherapy (also known as chemicals). The method of simultaneously using radiotherapy combined with chemicals is called concurrent chemo-radiotherapy, which is often prescribed for patients with high-risk nasopharyngeal cancer (such as large tumors, EBV concentrations). High DNA in blood,...).\nRadiation therapy: This is a treatment method that uses high-energy particles or waves (such as X-rays, gamma rays, protons) to shine on the tumor to kill or damage cancer cells. Radiation therapy with high technology such as dose-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) helps deliver a dose that thoroughly treats tumors, while limiting the dose that affects surrounding healthy organs (such as parotid salivary glands and spinal cord). ,...), both ensuring treatment effectiveness and minimizing treatment-related side effects. The target of radiotherapy for stage 2 nasopharyngeal cancer includes the primary tumor and pathological lymph node areas or lymph node areas with a high risk of metastasis. Damage will be determined based on computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or PET/CT imaging. Before starting radiotherapy for the nasopharynx, doctors will evaluate the patient's general health status, nutritional status, dental condition and swallowing function. This helps ensure that the radiotherapy plan is successful without interruption.\nSide effects related to radiotherapy include early side effects and late side effects:\nEarly side effects: may occur during radiotherapy in the head - face - neck area in general such as fatigue, loss of appetite, dermatitis caused by radiation therapy, painful swallowing, difficulty swallowing, changes in taste,...; Late side effects: manifest after many months or years such as hypothyroidism, jaw bone necrosis, neck sclerosis, etc.\nRadiation therapy is one of the fundamental treatment methods for stage 2 nasopharyngeal cancer\nChemotherapy: This method can be performed at the same time as radiotherapy (in concurrent chemotherapy-radiation treatment), or chemotherapy can be given before radiotherapy to reduce the size of the tumor. radiotherapy planning is safer and easier. In addition, chemotherapy is also indicated in cases of residual disease or cases of disease progression to metastasis after radical chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Chemicals commonly used in concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens are cisplatin, or carboplatin (in cases of intolerance or unsuitability for cisplatin).\nWhen receiving concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy, patients may experience more side effects than radiotherapy alone such as: vomiting, nausea, fatigue, poor appetite, etc.",
