    "subsection_content": "In the nasopharyngeal cancer staging system, stage 3 has the following characteristics: (2)\nCase 1: The tumor spreads to surrounding structures and nasal sinuses, invades the skull base, invades the cervical spine (T3), with or without metastasis to the cervical lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are ≤6cm in size. No distant metastasis to other parts of the body has been recorded (M0).\nCase two: The primary tumor cannot be detected in the nasopharynx, or the tumor is limited to the nasopharynx or may have grown into the pharyngeal wall, nasal cavity or parapharyngeal cavity (T0, T1, T2). Cancer cells can invade lymph node masses in the neck with lymph node size ≤6cm (N2, M0).\nSee more:\nStage 0 nasopharyngeal cancer; Stage 1 nasopharyngeal cancer; Stage 2 nasopharyngeal cancer; Stage 4 nasopharyngeal cancer",
