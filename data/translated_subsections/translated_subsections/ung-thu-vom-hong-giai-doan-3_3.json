This stage recognizes the tumor growing locally - in the region.\nRegarding prognosis, to answer the question \"how long can a patient with stage 3 nasopharyngeal cancer live\", doctors will rely on clinical examination and evaluation of the EBV viral DNA load test index (Epstein-Epstein). Barr Virus). According to the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO), for low EBV viral loads (less than 400 copies/mL), there is a 66% chance that patients can live more than 5 years from the time of diagnosis. If the test shows a viral load higher than 400 copies/mL, this rate drops to only 54%.\nIn fact, the viral load index only partly reflects disease progression. Many cases have shown that people with stage 3 nasopharyngeal cancer can live up to 5-6 years after the disease is detected, while there are also cases where they can only live 6 months - 1 year. Therefore, the survival prognosis for cancer patients is only relative and will depend on each individual disease, general health status, level of response to treatment and tolerance of each patient.",
