    "subsection_content": "To diagnose stage 3 nasopharyngeal cancer, doctors will take the following approaches:\nClinical examination\nThe doctor conducts a clinical examination, evaluates the patient's nutritional status, symptoms, examines the cervical lymph nodes, cranial nerves, observes the teeth, mouth and throat area, and distant metastases.\nEar, nose and throat endoscopy\nIf signs suggestive of disease are present, the doctor will prescribe an ENT endoscopy to detect unusual lesions. ENT endoscopy helps doctors clearly observe the area inside the nasopharynx thanks to the images captured by the camera, giving images magnified 10-30 times. The camera is attached to the end of a soft tube wire, threaded through the patient's nose, ears and throat.\nEar, nose and throat endoscopy helps detect lesions suspected of nasopharyngeal cancer\nBiopsy\nIf abnormal lesions are suspected, the doctor will perform a biopsy of a specimen from the damaged area and send it to pathology to determine whether the lesion is malignant or benign.\nEBV DNA analysis test and imaging diagnosis – Nuclear medicine\nBlood tests such as peripheral blood cell analysis and plasma EBV DNA load testing may be ordered.\nWhen there are clinical signs and histopathological evidence indicating that the patient has nasopharyngeal cancer, the doctor will give some indications for imaging diagnosis - nuclear medicine to diagnose and determine the stage. diseases such as computed tomography CT, PET-CT, magnetic resonance imaging MRI... to evaluate the size and level of invasion of the tumor, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis if any.
