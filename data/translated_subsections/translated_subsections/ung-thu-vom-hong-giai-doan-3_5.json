With modern medical advances, timely treatment allows many patients to live longer, even when the disease is detected at stage 3.\nAccording to MSc. Luu Thao Ngoc, a number of factors are related to developing a treatment regimen for stage 3 nasopharyngeal cancer such as:\nYear old; The patient's overall condition; Accompanying medical diseases; Treatment goals; Response and tolerance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy\nIn general, a multimodal treatment regimen (including radiotherapy and chemotherapy) will be indicated when treating stage 3 nasopharyngeal cancer. Patients often receive radical concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. to destroy tumors and metastatic lymph nodes. Some patients may receive chemotherapy first, then radical chemotherapy and radiotherapy later (for example, patients with large tumors receive chemotherapy first to shrink the tumor and metastatic lymph nodes to support the disease). makes radiotherapy easier and less complicated). (3)\nRadiotherapy method\nRadiation therapy is the choice used in the treatment of nasopharyngeal cancer because the anatomical location is difficult to reach with surgery. Using high-energy ionizing radiation, such as X-rays or protons, kills cancer cells. For stage 3 nasopharyngeal cancer, external radiotherapy is often prescribed. Advanced radiotherapy techniques such as dose-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) effectively destroy tumors and reduce side effects on surrounding healthy organs. (4)\nSide effects of radiotherapy can occur such as dermatitis, skin redness, dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, mucositis... If chemotherapy and radiotherapy are performed at the same time, the side effects can be severe. More importantly, it causes discomfort and pain in the mouth and throat.\nChemotherapy method\nChemotherapy is the use of chemicals to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy is usually administered into the patient's body through intravenous infusion, some through oral administration. Chemotherapy treatment for stage 3 nasopharyngeal cancer includes:\nConcurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy: applying chemotherapy and radiotherapy at the same time; Adjuvant chemotherapy: chemotherapy is given after the patient completes concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy; Induction chemotherapy: using chemotherapy drugs intravenously before radiotherapy or before chemotherapy - radiotherapy.\nDrugs to treat stage 3 nasopharyngeal cancer include the Platinum group of drugs, including Cisplatin and Carboplatin, often used in concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens. Unwanted effects of chemotherapy drugs such as nausea, vomiting, electrolyte disorders, toxicity on the hematopoietic system, hair loss... Therefore, depending on the patient's condition, the doctor will adjust the appropriate dosage. .\nMultimodal combination in the treatment of stage 3 nasopharyngeal cancer\nFor stage 3 nasopharyngeal cancer, doctors often apply multimodality therapy, that is, using chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy. Chemotherapy may be given first followed by concurrent radiotherapy. or concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Which therapy to apply is based on the treatment guidelines of the Vietnamese Ministry of Health, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO), and the European Oncology Society. Europe (ESMO), US National Cancer Network (NCCN) and other reputable cancer organizations.\nTreatment of stage 3 nasopharyngeal cancer (case T3N0M0): Concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy are often prescribed thanks to their superior effectiveness compared to radiotherapy alone. Cisplatin weekly or high doses every 3 weeks is a commonly used chemotherapy drug. If the patient has contraindications or is intolerant to Cisplatin, the doctor can replace it with Carboplatin.; Treatment of stage 3 nasopharyngeal cancer (cases T0N2M0, T1N2M0, T2N2M0):\nInduction chemotherapy may be applied, followed by concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. If the site responds well, the tumor and metastatic lymph nodes can shrink and decrease in size significantly, making radiotherapy easier. This is an option often preferred by many treating doctors. Leading chemotherapy regimen (such as Gemcitabine and Cisplatin regimen), followed by concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy withÂ  Cisplatin.\nAnother alternative for this group is concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. This method helps improve the success rate of treatment and increase survival time compared to radiotherapy alone. Cisplatin and Fluorouracil regimen is often indicated in supportive treatment.\nMSc. Dr. Luu Thao Ngoc emphasized that treating stage 3 nasopharyngeal cancer requires great effort from the patient as well as the family because this is a stage where the disease has progressed far, affecting many surrounding structures. around. However, thanks to scientific advances in cancer treatment, methods such as multimodality treatment contribute to increasing survival rates for patients. What is necessary from the patient's side is to coordinate and comply with the treatment regimen prescribed by the doctor, while avoiding anxiety, confusion, and negativity. Finally, patients need to organize their lives scientifically and change bad habits.",
