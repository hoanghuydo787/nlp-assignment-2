    "subsection_content": "Nasopharyngeal cancer is divided into 5 stages, from stage 0 to IV. Early stage nasopharyngeal cancer, also known as early stage nasopharyngeal cancer, is determined from stage 0 - III (T1N2), which is the stage of local cancer in the region, but has not metastasized to other locations. .\nStage 0 (Tis, N0, M0): The tumor is only in the top layer of cells inside the nasopharynx and has not grown deeper (Tis). The cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes (N0), nor has it spread to distant parts of the body (M0).; Stage I (T1 N0 M0): The tumor is limited to the nasopharynx. The tumor may have spread to the pharynx (part of the throat at the back of the mouth) and/or nasal cavity but no further than the pharynx (T1). The cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes (N0), nor has it spread to distant parts of the body (M0).; Stage II (T0 N1 M0, or T1 N1 M0, or T2 N0 M0, or N1 M0): The tumor is in the nasopharynx. The tumor may have grown into the pharynx (part of the throat behind the mouth) and/or nasal cavity (T1); or has spread to the throat but no further (T2). Or no tumor is found in the nasopharynx (T0), but cancer is found in the lymph nodes in the neck.\nCancer has spread to one or more lymph nodes on one side of the neck, or to lymph nodes on one/or both sides in the back of the throat. In both cases, no lymph node was larger than 6 cm horizontally (N1).\nCancer has not metastasized to distant parts of the body (M0).\nStage II (T2, N0 or N1, M0): The tumor has grown into the area around the throat and surrounding structures, but not into the bone (T2).\nCancer has not spread to nearby lymph nodes (N0); or has spread to one or more lymph nodes on one side of the neck, or has metastasized to unilateral/or bilateral lymph nodes in the back of the throat. In both cases, no lymph node was larger than 6 cm horizontally (N1).\nCancer has not metastasized to distant parts of the body (M0).\nStage III (T0 or T1, N2, M0): The tumor is in the nasopharynx. The tumor may have grown into the pharynx (part of the throat behind the mouth) and/or nasal cavity (T1). Or no tumor is found in the nasopharynx (T0), but cancer is found in the lymph nodes in the neck.\nCancer has spread to lymph nodes on both sides of the neck, none of which are larger than 6cm across (N2).\nCancer has not metastasized to distant parts of the body (M0).",
