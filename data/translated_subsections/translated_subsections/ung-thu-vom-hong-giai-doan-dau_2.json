This rate does not indicate specifically how long a person with the disease will live, but can help better understand the likely success of treatment. The earlier cancer is diagnosed, the higher the chance of successful treatment, which means the higher the survival rate.\nPatients with early-stage nasopharyngeal cancer often have good results, with a 5-year survival rate of 60-75%.
