    "subsection_content": "Doctor Tran Vuong Thao Nghi said that early-stage nasopharyngeal cancer is often treated with a combination regimen of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Surgery has almost no role in the radical treatment of early-stage nasopharyngeal cancer.\nDepending on the stage of the disease, the condition of the tumor as well as the status of lymph node metastasis, the doctor will prescribe a different regimen combining radiotherapy with chemotherapy.\nFor example: If the patient has large metastases in bilateral cervical lymph nodes, a few rounds of chemotherapy can be given first to reduce the size of the lymph nodes, followed by radiotherapy concurrently with chemotherapy; Depending on the response to concurrent chemotherapy, decide whether additional chemotherapy is needed or not.\nCommonly used chemotherapy drugs may include Cisplatin, Carboplatin, 5-FU, Docetaxel, Gemcitabine, Capecitabine.\nMost studies show that concurrent radiotherapy helps bring about better treatment results, helping patients live longer than radiotherapy alone. But combining chemotherapy can lead to more side effects, affecting the patient's quality of life.\nIn cases where cervical lymph nodes remain after the end of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, surgery may be considered to remove the cervical lymph nodes, helping to better control the disease.\nConcurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy help bring good treatment results for early-stage nasopharyngeal cancer\nNasopharyngeal cancer recurrence - metastasis\nRecurrent cancer is when the disease reappears after treatment ends. The disease can recur locally (at the previous tumor site, or nearby areas, or in previous lymph nodes). Recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer is when the disease recurs and spreads to other organs in the body such as the lungs, bones, liver, lymph nodes, brain...\nThe choice of treatment method for recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer depends on many factors such as: Location and spread of the disease, overall health of the patient, time of recurrence after diagnosis. How long was the previous treatment, and what was the previous treatment? The goal of treatment at this time is to slow the progression of the disease, alleviate symptoms and help ensure the best possible quality of life. The doctor will carefully consider the benefits and risks, between the effectiveness and the risks, before making a treatment decision for the patient.",
