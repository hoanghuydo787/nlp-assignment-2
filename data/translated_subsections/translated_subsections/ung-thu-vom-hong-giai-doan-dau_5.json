    "subsection_content": "According to Dr. Tran Vuong Thao Nghi, not all nasopharyngeal cancers can be prevented, but the risk of the disease can be reduced by avoiding some of the following risk factors: (3)\nAvoid tobacco and alcohol\nTobacco use is a factor in nasopharyngeal cancer. Every person should avoid exposure to tobacco (by not smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke).\nUncontrolled alcohol use is also a risk factor for cancer. In addition, combining smoking and drinking alcohol can significantly increase the carcinogenic effect of cigarette smoke on the nasopharynx.\nAvoid contact with chemicals\nWorking environments at risk of exposure to chemicals require good ventilation systems and use of necessary protective equipment (masks, clothes, hats, etc.) which are important protective measures. .\nHealthy eating habits\nThe American Cancer Society recommends following a healthy diet with a full range of nutrients (protein, starch, fat, fiber, vitamins and minerals, dairy products) including many fruits, vegetables and whole grains, balance proteins, and limit excessive consumption of red meat and processed foods as well as alcoholic beverages.\nGet the HPV vaccine and avoid HPV infection\nThe risk of oropharyngeal HPV infection is increased in people who have oral sex and have multiple sexual partners. Smokers are more likely to get HPV, possibly because substances in cigarettes damage the immune system or damage the cells lining the oropharynx.\nVaccination against HPV helps reduce the risk of infection with some types of HPV. Preventing HPV infection reduces the risk factor for cervical cancer, and has also  been shown to reduce the risk of other HPV-related cancers (such as anal cancer , penile cancer, oral and oropharyngeal cancer).\nAlong with Southeast Asian countries and China, Vietnam is in a region with high risk factors for nasopharyngeal cancer. Therefore, doctor Tran Vuong Thao Nghi recommends that prevention should be improved by maintaining a healthy lifestyle in terms of nutrition and physical activity; HPV vaccination; proactively have regular health check-ups every 6 months or once a year; Proactively screen for nasopharyngeal cancer if there are risk factors or unusual signs of otolaryngology. Early stage nasopharyngeal cancer still has a relatively positive cure rate.",
