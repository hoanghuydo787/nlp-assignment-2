    "subsection_content": "There are 3 types of cancer in the nasopharynx (2), including:\nNasopharyngeal cancer (NPC)\nThe nasopharynx is the upper part of the throat and behind the nose. NPC is the leading cancer type among head and neck cancers, and ranks 6th among cancers in general. The incidence is high in some races, especially Asians. The incidence of the disease in men is 2-3 times higher than in women. Nasopharyngeal cancer has a good prognosis if detected early and treated properly and promptly.\nOropharyngeal cancer\nThe pharynx is the middle part of the throat and behind the nose. Oropharyngeal cancer includes the base of the tongue, tonsils, soft palate, and posterior pharyngeal wall. This type of cancer is on the rise, and 70% of cases are caused by human papilloma virus (e.g. HPV type 16) sexually transmitted during oral sex. HPV (+) oropharyngeal cancer has a better prognosis and different treatment options than HPV (-) oropharyngeal cancer.\nMen are twice as likely to get oropharyngeal cancer as women.\nHypopharyngeal cancer, also known as hypopharyngeal cancer\nThe hypopharynx (lower pharynx) is the bottom part of the throat. Hypopharyngeal cancer is rare. The number of new cases is trending down due to reduced smoking.",
