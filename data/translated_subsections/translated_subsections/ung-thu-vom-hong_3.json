    "subsection_content": "Most cases of malignant nasopharyngeal tumors originate from one of three causes: smoking, drinking too much alcohol and HPV infection. (3)\nCigarette\nWhen you smoke (active) or inhale cigarette smoke (passive), a small amount of cancer-causing chemicals enter your lungs. This is why tobacco becomes the leading cause of lung cancer. Not only that, other parts of the body exposed to tobacco, including the throat, are also easily attacked by cancer cells.\nAlcohol\nIf tobacco increases the risk of nasopharyngeal cancer, alcohol is a factor that makes the disease worse. Research shows that drinking alcohol while smoking significantly increases the risk of head and neck cancer compared to smoking alone or drinking alcohol alone. The reason is that alcohol acts as an irritant in the mouth and throat, making it easier for chemicals in cigarettes to enter cells.\nBesides, alcohol also slows down the body's ability to decompose and eliminate toxic chemicals. These two things form a \"combo\" that is extremely beneficial for cancer cells to form and develop.\nHuman papillomavirus – HPV\nPreviously, tobacco was the leading cause of nasopharyngeal cancer. In recent years, human papilloma virus (HPV) has become the most common cause of this disease.\nHPV is a group of about 100 viruses spread through anal and oral sex; Some of them have the potential to cause cancer. Experts believe that oral sex will lead to an increased risk of HPV-related throat cancer.\nHead and neck cancer caused by HPV often develops in the oropharynx, including the tonsils, base of the tongue, soft palate and back of the throat. Currently, this disease is the most common form of cancer related to the HPV virus.\nIn addition to the three main causes of tobacco, alcohol and HPV, there are a number of other risk factors that cause malignant tumors in the nasopharynx, including:\nEthnicity: Researchers have not yet explained why, but it seems that people of Asian descent (yellow skin), especially those of Chinese descent, are at higher risk of getting the disease. Meanwhile, black and white people are more likely to get cancer of the pharynx and larynx.; Epstein-Barr virus: Epstein-Barr virus infection is a risk factor for nasopharyngeal cancer; Nutrition: Diets low in vitamins A and E may increase the risk of nasopharyngeal cancer, laryngeal cancer and oropharyngeal cancer.; Occupation: Some toxic chemicals such as asbestos, wood dust, paint fumes... are agents that increase the risk of developing malignant tumors. Therefore, people working in the construction, metalworking, textile, ceramics, logging and food industries are more likely to get this disease.; Chewing betel: Many Vietnamese still keep the habit of chewing betel, and they do not know that the mixture of betel leaves, areca nuts and quicklime is closely related to an increased risk of cancer.; Plummer-Vinson syndrome: This rare condition, which involves iron deficiency and causes difficulty swallowing, increases the risk of throat cancer.\nDrinking alcohol while smoking significantly increases the risk of nasopharyngeal cancer",
