    "subsection_content": "To diagnose nasopharyngeal cancer, the primary tumor must be carefully examined and evaluated combined with endoscopy. Adjacent lymph nodes must also be examined similarly. The detected tumor must be confirmed by histological results. Any other pathological data obtained from biopsy or diagnostic imaging tests must be carefully considered in conjunction with the staging diagnosis.(5)\nChest X-ray is indicated in cases where cancer has metastasized to the lungs\nPET-CT scan: In addition to supporting CT scan/MRI in supplementing information for the primary tumor, PET-CT scan can assist in identifying cervical lymph nodes, but cannot examine microscopic lesions. However, PET-CT is superior to both CT and MRI in detecting metastatic regional lymph nodes, as well as distant metastatic lesions, or second primary tumors.; CT scan: This method helps evaluate head and neck tumors by detecting anatomical structure deformation and increased contrast absorption in the tumor. Invasive lesions to the bones and cartilage of the head and neck region, a factor that affects the diagnosis of disease stage, can also be detected by CT scan. CT scan with contrast injection can confirm the extent of invasion and spread of the tumor to the neck lymph nodes, adjacent organs and even metastatic lesions to other parts of the body.; MRI: MRI can examine soft tissue better than a CT scan and often provides additional information in addition to a CT scan. But CT scan can provide better information about bone invasion than MRI.; Endoscopy: This procedure is performed using a small, flexible tube with a camera on the end to see inside the nasopharynx and look for abnormalities. Tissue sampling for biopsy is also performed through this endoscope.; Biopsy: This method is often used to get the first histological diagnosis as soon as the patient has a tumor in the neck. There are biopsy methods: Open biopsy: Surgery to remove tissue samples for biopsy. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA): Use a small needle to poke into the tumor or lymph node to obtain a biopsy tissue sample. Endoscopic biopsy: Take a biopsy tissue sample with the help of an endoscope.; Open biopsy: Surgical removal of a tissue sample for biopsy; Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA): Use a small needle to poke into the tumor or lymph node to obtain a biopsy tissue sample.; Endoscopic biopsy: Take a biopsy tissue sample with the help of an endoscope.; HPV-p16 test; EBV-DNA test\nSee more: Screening for nasopharyngeal cancer: methods and procedures.",
