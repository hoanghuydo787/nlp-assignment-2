    "subsection_content": "Similar to many other types of cancer, treatments for nasopharyngeal cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Depending on the condition and a number of other factors, the doctor will provide a treatment plan with appropriate methods.\nSurgery\nSurgery is a treatment that can be performed at all stages of the disease. The doctor performs surgery to remove the tumor or lymph nodes in the neck and some surrounding healthy tissue. After surgery, patients may continue treatment with radiation therapy or chemotherapy.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiation therapy is a treatment that uses high-energy X-rays or other types of rays to kill cancer cells or stop the growth of cancer cells. There are 2 methods of radiotherapy\nExternal radiation therapy: Using a machine outside the body to shine beams toward the cancerous organization; Internal radiation therapy: Using radioactive substances placed directly inside or near the cancerous tissue.\nIndications for internal or external radiotherapy depend on the type and stage of the cancer. Currently, thanks to the remarkable progress of external radiotherapy machines, some internal radiotherapy techniques can be replaced by external radiotherapy.\nValence\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses oral pills or intravenous drugs to prevent the growth of cancer cells as well as kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy for nasopharyngeal cancer can be done at the same time as radiotherapy (simultaneous chemo-radiation) or after completing radiotherapy or before radiotherapy. Your doctor will decide on chemotherapy depending on the type and stage of the disease.\nTargeted therapy\nThis is a treatment that uses drugs to attack specific cancer cells. Monoclonal antibodies are a form of targeted treatment. These monoclonal antibodies have the effect of killing cancer cells, blocking the growth or spread of cancer cells.\nCetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that works by binding to a protein on the surface of cancer cells, stopping their growth and division. It is used in the treatment of recurrent and metastatic cancer.",
