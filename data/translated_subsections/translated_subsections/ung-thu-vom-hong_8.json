The ingredients we need to provide are:\nCarbohydrates (starch): Bread, potatoes, rice, noodles, vermicelli... are foods in the starch group, providing energy for muscles and brain.; Protein: found in fish and seafood, lean meat, poultry, eggs, beans, nuts...; They provide amino acids, build and develop muscle cells, skin and hair cells, nerve cells...; Lipids (fats): This is an indispensable component for the immune system, brain and many other organs. A balanced diet requires adequate saturated fats, unsaturated fats and cooking oils. All types of meat are rich sources of saturated fat. Unsaturated fats are found in oily fish (tuna, salmon, mackerel, herring...) and good oils for cancer patients include fish oil, soybean oil, sesame oil, sunflower oil. positive…; Fruits and vegetables: provide us with fiber, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fluids.; Milk and dairy products (cheese, butter, whey...): considered a mixture of protein, fat and carbohydrates. You should choose low-fat or skim milk, no/low sugar.; Water: Besides consuming nutritious foods, cancer patients need to supplement 1.5 - 2 liters of water per day, which can be filtered water, pure fruit juice, smoothies...\nA diet is considered balanced when all of the above ingredients are used at the right time, in the right amount and with the right frequency.\nPatients with nasopharyngeal cancer often experience effects before treatment (caused by the disease), during treatment (due to immediate side effects) and after stopping treatment (due to lasting side effects). .
