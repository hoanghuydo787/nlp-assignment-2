The numbers or letters following T, N and M provide detailed information about these elements. (3)\nAccording to TNM, stage 0 can be grouped as follows:\nTis: Indicates carcinoma in situ (DCIS, or Paget's disease of the breast).; N0: Cancer has not spread to nearby lymph nodes; M0: cancer has not spread to other parts of the body.\nOnce determined, the T N and M factors will be combined and give an overall stage of 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4.\nSee more:\nStage 1 breast cancer; Stage 2 breast cancer; Stage 3 breast cancer; Stage 4 breast cancer",
