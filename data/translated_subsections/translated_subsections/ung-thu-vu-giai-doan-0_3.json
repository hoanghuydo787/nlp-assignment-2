    "subsection_content": "Methods for diagnosing stage 0 breast cancer include:\nMammography: This is a diagnostic method with a high accuracy rate and is often used in breast cancer screening. Tam Anh General Hospital applies the digital mammography system (DBT) - Mammomat Inspiration to help increase the cancer detection rate by up to 40% and reduce the false positive rate with corresponding data.; Ultrasound: Can evaluate the nature and size of breast tumors; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Indicated in some special situations. Tam Anh General Hospital is equipped with a German magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system applying \"Full biological matrix\" technology, saving 50% of scanning time, giving outstanding diagnostic results, minimizing radiation compared to standard procedures.; Biopsy of breast lesions for histopathological diagnosis: Must be performed to definitively diagnose breast cancer. One or a combination of multiple biopsy methods can be used such as fine needle aspiration (FNA), or core biopsy with a large needle (Core biopsy) or partial/complete tumor biopsy by surgery. art.\nThe digital mammography (DBT) system at Tam Anh General Hospital helps detect stage 0 breast cancer for timely treatment.",
