    "subsection_content": "Stage 1 breast cancer is the earliest stage of invasive breast cancer. “Invasive” does not mean that the cancer has invaded other areas of the body but that cells in the tumor have entered the area through the choroid.\nWhen a new tumor begins, it has not yet grown through this membrane and is called carcinoma in situ. These tumors are called stage 0 tumors. Carcinoma in situ is 100% curable with surgery because the cells are completely contained.\nStage 1 tumors are the earliest stage of invasive breast cancer. These tumors are small, and if they have spread to the lymph nodes, the spread is only microscopic.\nBreast cancer comes in many forms, and some forms of stage 1 breast cancer may include:\nInvasive ductal carcinoma (IDC): Cancer that originates in the milk ducts of the breast and has spread into surrounding breast tissue. IDC is the most common type of breast cancer, accounting for 80% of all breast cancers.; Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC): Cancer that originates in the milk-producing lobules (glands) of the breast and has spread into surrounding breast tissue. ILC is the second most common type of breast cancer, and accounts for 10% of all breast cancers.; There are also other less common forms of invasive breast cancer, such as inflammatory breast cancer and Paget's disease of the nipple.",
