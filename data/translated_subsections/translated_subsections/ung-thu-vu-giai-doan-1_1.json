Therefore, understanding the TNM system will be helpful for patients in understanding the stage of breast cancer.\nT = Tumor size: All stage 1 cancers are T-0 or T-1, meaning the tumor is 2cm or less in diameter.; N = Nodes: All stage 1 cancers are N-0 or N-1mi. N-0, which means it has not spread to any lymph nodes. N-1 means it has spread to nearby lymph nodes. “Mi” means there are microscopic particles, which can only be seen under a microscope. Micrometastases have diameters ranging from 0.2mm – 2mm; M = Metastatic: M-0 means the cancer has not spread to other areas of the body.\nTherefore, using the TNM system, stage 1 cancer is defined as follows:\nStage 1 breast cancer is further divided into Stage 1A and 1B.
