    "subsection_content": "According to data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, the earlier breast cancer is first diagnosed, the better the outcome. Survival rates for people diagnosed with breast cancer have also improved over time due to earlier detection and improvements in treatment. Can stage 1 breast cancer be cured? Most people with stage 1 breast cancer can be treated successfully with a rate of nearly 100%.\nHowever, it is impossible to accurately predict the course of cancer and each person's life span. Survival prognosis as well as treatment effectiveness depends on many factors.\nFactors that affect a patient's prognosis include:\nAbility to respond to treatment;; Type of breast cancer;; Tumor growth rate;; Other factors such as age, medical history and overall health;; Treatment can affect survival in early breast cancer.\nIn most cases, the earlier breast cancer is diagnosed and treated, the better the chance of survival. Cancer cells often become more difficult to treat and can develop drug resistance as the disease spreads. The goal of stage 1 breast cancer treatment is to remove the breast cancer and any other cancer cells remaining in the breast, armpit, or other parts of the body. Treatment at this stage can also reduce the risk of the cancer recurring.",
