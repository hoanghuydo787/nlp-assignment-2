    "subsection_content": "Treatment options for stage 1 breast cancer are divided into two main categories:\nLocal treatment methods: These methods treat cancer locally, including surgery and radiation therapy.; Systemic treatments: These treat the system, including chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.\nIf the tumor is very small, only local treatment is usually needed. In cases where the tumor is larger, more invasive, has spread to lymph nodes or has a molecular structure that suggests it is more likely to spread further, doctors often prescribe treatment with systemic methods. With stage 1 breast cancer, the use of systemic therapy is considered adjuvant therapy to eliminate any cancer cells that may have spread beyond the breast.\nSurgery\nThe majority of stage 1 breast cancer patients are often treated with surgery. Options include lumpectomy (removal of only part of the breast) or mastectomy (removal of the entire breast).\nIf the tumor is removed, the patient often receives radiation therapy after surgery to control the cancer and prevent recurrence.\nIf the entire breast is removed, the patient can have breast reconstruction right during the mastectomy. In this procedure, the mastectomy is often placed at the same time as the mastectomy. Additionally, depending on risk factors, patients may need to weigh the risks and benefits of a single versus double mastectomy.\nValence\nChemotherapy is sometimes used as an adjuvant treatment for stage 1 breast cancer. It is intended to treat any cancer cells that have spread out of the breast before developing metastases.\nThe use of chemotherapy also depends greatly on the response of the tumor. In a HER-2 positive or triple negative patient, chemotherapy is often used even if the lymph nodes are completely negative.\nHowever, it is difficult to determine whether a person will benefit from chemotherapy. This is especially difficult in stage 1 breast tumors that are hormone receptor-negative or HER-2 negative.\nRadiotherapy\nIf a tumor is removed, radiation therapy is often used to treat the remaining breast tissue. Radiation therapy may be given after a lumpectomy and mastectomy. Radiation therapy helps kill cancer cells that may be left behind or that are too small to see.\nHormone therapy\nIf the tumor is positive for estrogen receptors, hormone therapy is often recommended after treatment with surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and metastasis.\nEstrogen receptor-positive tumors are more likely to recur late (more than 5 years after diagnosis). Tamoxifen is often used in premenopausal women. Postmenopausal women are often treated with aromatase inhibitors such as Aromasin (exemestane), Arimidex (anastrozole), or Femara (letrozole). In some high-risk premenopausal women, aromatase inhibitors are sometimes used together with medications that suppress ovarian function.\nTargeted medication\nThese are HER2-targeted therapies. If the tumor is HER2 positive, a HER2-targeting drug such as Herceptin (trastuzumab) is often prescribed.\nClinical trials\nThe only way to make progress in breast cancer treatment is through research into new drugs and procedures in clinical trials. Myths abound about clinical trials, but the truth is that every treatment being used today was once studied in a clinical trial. If other treatments are unsuccessful, this may be an avenue to explore. It is important to choose the best treatment for the patient.\nPeople should have regular check-ups after treatment so that doctors can monitor and prevent the risk of breast cancer recurring\nStage 1 breast cancer is often effectively treated with surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapies. This is considered early stage breast cancer with a good prognosis. Patients should discuss their diagnosis with their doctor and choose the most appropriate and effective treatment method. It is important that the patient remains optimistic, always actively cooperates with the doctor and persistently follows the doctor's treatment regimen. In addition, after treatment, patients continue to have follow-up examinations and tests to monitor cancer status. This is essential for early detection and timely treatment if the cancer recurs.",
