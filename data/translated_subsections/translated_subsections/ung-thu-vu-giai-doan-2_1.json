T0  No evidence of primary tumor found. T1  The tumor is no more than 2cm in greatest diameter. T2  Diameter of the largest tumor is more than 2cm and less than or equal to 5cm. T3  The tumor is more than 5cm in greatest diameter. T4   Tumor of any size but with direct invasion of the chest wall and/or skin causing ulcers, orange peel-like skin or skin nodules. N (Node): Regional lymph nodes Nx  Regional lymph nodes cannot be evaluated. For example, lymph nodes have been previously removed. N0  No metastasis to regional lymph nodes. This is determined on imaging or clinical examination. N1  Has axillary lymph node metastasis on the same side as the cancerous breast; mobile lymph nodes.
