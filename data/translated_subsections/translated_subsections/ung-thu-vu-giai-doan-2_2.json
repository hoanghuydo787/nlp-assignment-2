Based on the stage of cancer and the biological properties of the tumor, doctors can recommend appropriate treatment methods.\nTo determine the stage of the disease, in addition to tests to diagnose the disease such as breast ultrasound, mammography, breast MRI, breast lesion biopsy, patients need to do a number of other whole-body examination methods such as: ultrasound. Abdominal ultrasound, neck ultrasound, chest X-ray or abdominal CT scan, chest CT scan, brain CT scan, bone scan... (depending on tumor status, tumor biology and organ symptoms).\nTo know the biological properties of the tumor, on specimens with confirmed cancer, additional tests are needed to determine the status of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone (PR), and growth factor receptors.
