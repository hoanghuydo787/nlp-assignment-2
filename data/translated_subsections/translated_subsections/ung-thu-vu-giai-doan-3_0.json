    "subsection_content": "Stage III breast cancer is breast cancer with tumor size >5cm; or has grown into nearby tissues (skin above the breast or chest wall muscle below the breast); May be accompanied by cancer that has metastasized to many nearby lymph nodes (axillary lymph nodes, internal mammary nodes, supraclavicular or subclavian on the same side).\nInflammatory breast cancer (red, swollen skin on the breast) is also considered a stage III cancer (if the disease has not spread to other organs in the body). Although this disease is rare, it often progresses rapidly and has a poor prognosis, requiring early intervention and systemic treatment.\nThe 5-year survival prognosis in stage III breast cancer patients is 86%.",
