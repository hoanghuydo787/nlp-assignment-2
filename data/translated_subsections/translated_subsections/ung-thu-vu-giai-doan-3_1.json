(first)\nT (Tumor): Describes the size and nature of the tumor.; N (Node): Describes the state of cancer metastasis to regional lymph nodes.; M (Metastasis): Describes the state of cancer metastasis to other parts of the body.\nTNM Stage of Breast Cancer:\nTNM stage (AJCC 8)  T (Tumor): Primary tumor Tx  Primary tumor cannot be evaluated. T0  No evidence of primary tumor. T1  U is 2cm in greatest diameter. T2  Us have a largest diameter >2cm and ≤5cm. T3  The tumor has a greatest diameter of >5cm. T4   Tumor of any size but with direct invasion of the chest wall and/or skin (ulcers, orange spots or nodules   on the skin). N (Node): Regional lymph nodes Nx  Regional lymph nodes that cannot be evaluated (e.g., nodes that have been previously removed). N0  No regional lymph node metastasis (determined on imaging or clinical examination). N1  Ipsilateral axillary lymph node metastasis, mobile. N2  Axillary lymph node metastasis on the same side but clinically the lymph nodes are adherent to each other or another organ, or   metastasis to the internal mammary lymph node only on the same side but there is no clinical evidence of axillary lymph node metastasis. N3  Ipsilateral subclavian lymph node metastasis with or without axillary lymph node metastasis; or metastasis to internal mammary lymph nodes on the same side with axillary lymph node metastasis; or ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node metastasis with or without accompanying axillary or internal mammary lymph node metastasis. M (Metastasis): Distant metastases M0  No clinical or imaging evidence of distant metastases. M1  Distant metastases can be detected by clinical and imaging means.\nAccording to Dr. Tran Thi Thien Huong, PhD, Department of Oncology, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, the stage of cancer indicates the size - the degree of invasion of the malignant tumor and the degree of metastasis. Based on the stage of cancer and the biological properties of the tumor, doctors can decide on appropriate treatment methods.\nTo determine the stage of breast cancer, in addition to tests to diagnose the disease such as breast ultrasound - mammography - breast MRI - breast lesion biopsy, patients need to do a number of other whole body tests such as : abdominal ultrasound, neck ultrasound, chest X-ray or abdominal CT scan, chest CT scan, brain CT scan, bone scan... (depending on tumor status, tumor biology and organ symptoms).\nTo know the biological properties of the tumor, on specimens with confirmed cancer, additional tests are needed to determine the status of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone (PR), and growth factor receptors. (HER2), evaluate the level of cell proliferation (Ki67) or BRCA gene mutations (on specimens with confirmed cancer, or in the blood).\nIn addition, patients also need to evaluate accompanying diseases to coordinate the safest treatment.\nStage III breast cancer, divided into 3 levels based on the TNM classification system.
