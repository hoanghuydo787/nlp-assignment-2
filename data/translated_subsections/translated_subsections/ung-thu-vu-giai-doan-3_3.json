    "subsection_content": "According to Dr. Thien Huong, the survival rate can vary based on the stage of the disease, biological factors of the tumor and the patient's age.\nSurvival rate depends on the stage of the cancer being locally localized, regional or distantly metastasized. Stage III breast cancer is still localized in the area, and may have metastasized to lymph nodes such as axillary, supraclavicular or subclavian lymph nodes on the same side of the breast cancer.\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, stage III breast cancer has a 5-year survival rate of about 86%. Of which, stage IIIA has a 5-year survival rate of 67%, stages IIIB - IIIC has a 5-year survival rate of 41-49%. (3)\nIs stage III breast cancer curable?
