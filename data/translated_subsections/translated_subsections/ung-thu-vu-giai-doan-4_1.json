    "subsection_content": "The TNM staging system stands for Tumor, Nodes, Metastasis. (first)\nT (Tumor): Describes the size and nature of the tumor.; N (Node): Describes the state of cancer metastasis to regional lymph nodes.; M (Metastasis): Describes the state of cancer metastasis to other parts of the body.\nTNM Stage of Breast Cancer:\nTNM stage (AJCC 8)  T (Tumor): Primary tumor Tx  Primary tumor cannot be evaluated. T0  No evidence of primary tumor. T1  U is 2cm in greatest diameter. T2  The tumor is ≤5cm in diameter and the largest is >2cm  T3  The diameter of the largest tumor is >5cm. T4   Regardless of the size of the tumor, the tumor directly invades the chest wall and/or skin. Skin symptoms may include ulcers, rough skin like an orange peel, or spots on the skin. N (Node): Regional lymph nodes Nx  Regional lymph nodes could not be evaluated (possibly because the lymph nodes had been operated on previously). N0  No palpable or imaging findings did not reveal regional lymph node metastases. N1  Axillary lymph node metastasis on the same side, the lymph node is still mobile. N2  Metastases to ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes, adherent lymph nodes, or adhesions to other tissues that can be detected clinically. Or there is metastasis in the internal mammary lymph nodes on the same side but no evidence of axillary lymph node metastasis is found clinically. N3  Ipsilateral subclavicular lymph node metastasis with or without axillary lymph node metastasis. Or metastasis to internal mammary lymph nodes on the same side and accompanied by metastasis to axillary lymph nodes. Or metastasis to the supraclavicular lymph node on the same side but with or without metastasis to the internal mammary or axillary lymph nodes. M (Metastasis): Distant metastasis M0  No clinical or imaging evidence of distant metastatic disease was found. M1  Distant metastases can be detected by clinical examination and by means of diagnostic imaging.\nThe stage of cancer indicates how large the tumor is and how much it has spread. Finding the stage of breast cancer will help doctors decide which treatment method is most appropriate and effective.\nStage IV breast cancer has the following characteristics:\nThe tumor can be any size.; May or may not metastasize to lymph nodes; Cancer has metastasized to other parts of the body such as bones, lungs, liver, brain...\nStage IV breast cancer includes patient groups assessed according to TNM as any T, any N, M1.\nSee more:\nStage 0 breast cancer; Stage 1 breast cancer; Stage 2 breast cancer; Stage 3 breast cancer",
