If the response is good to treatment, the lesions can be reduced in size or temporarily disappeared, or their growth can be slowed down.\nHowever, these lesions are not completely eliminated, but can still progress again.

Treatment usually lasts until the cancer begins to progress again; or until side effects that may be detrimental to the patient occur.

Can be combined with immunotherapy (if PD-L1 positive), or combined with drugs with PARP inhibitors (Olaparib or Talazoparib) (if BRCA mutation is positive),; If HER2 receptor is positive: Treatment is usually chemotherapy combined with anti-HER2 drugs (Trastuzumab can be combined with Pertuzumab).

May combine endocrine therapy (if ER PR endocrine receptor positive) and chemotherapy drugs.; If the HER2 receptor is negative, there is a PIK3CA gene mutation on tumor tissue (or in the blood), the ER hormone receptor is positive: PIK3 inhibitors can be used with Fulvestrant for postmenopausal women.\nThe goal of stage IV breast cancer treatment is to alleviate symptoms and prolong the patient's life.\nLocal or regional treatments\nRadiation therapy and/or surgery may be used in some cases to relieve local/regional symptoms, such as:\nRadiation therapy or breast surgery to reduce local tumor volume; Radiation therapy for brain metastases; Radiation therapy reduces pain and prevents fractures due to bone metastasis.; Radiation therapy or spine surgery: to reduce spinal cord compression; Radiation therapy pain relief.\nTreat symptoms\nPain relievers, stress relievers, drugs to slow down bone destruction due to bone metastasis such as Bisphosphonate, Pamidronate...\nThe disease progresses during treatment\nDr. Thao Nghi said that with stage IV breast cancer, the decision to continue specific treatment with drugs, or just palliative treatment, will depend on many factors such as: physical health status - spiritual-psychological-family-social as well as the wishes of the patient and relatives, biological properties of the tumor, previously used treatment drugs, progressive parts...\nPatients and relatives, in any situation, should not be pessimistic and give up everything. â€œAlthough there is no cure for stage IV breast cancer, with the continued advancement of medicine, there are many medications and supportive treatments available to help provide the best possible quality of life for women. patient.
