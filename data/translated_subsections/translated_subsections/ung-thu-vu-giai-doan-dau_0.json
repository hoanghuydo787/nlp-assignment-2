    "subsection_content": "Early stage breast cancer is cancer that has not spread beyond the breast or metastasized to lymph nodes in the armpit.\nBreast cancer begins in the lining (epithelial) cells of the ducts (85%) or lobules (15%) in the glandular tissue of the breast. Initially, cancer growth is limited to the ducts or lobules (“in situ”), usually causes no symptoms, and has a low likelihood of metastasis. (first)\nOver time, these in situ (stage 0) cancers can progress and invade surrounding breast tissue (invasive breast cancer). The cancer will then metastasize to nearby lymph nodes (regional metastasis) or to other organs in the body (distant metastasis).\nEarly stage breast cancer has a good prognosis, the 5-year survival rate is almost 100% after treatment",
