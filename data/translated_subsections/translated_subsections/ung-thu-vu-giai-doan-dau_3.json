If your doctor finds an area of ​​concern on a screening test (mammogram) or if you have symptoms that could indicate breast cancer, your doctor will order additional tests to know for sure. Is it cancer or not?\nDiagnostic imaging methods include:\nMammography: Mammography is often used in breast cancer screening for highly accurate diagnosis results. Mammography can detect most cases of breast cancer before symptoms appear. The 3D mammography system - Mammomat Inspiration at Tam Anh General Hospital can increase the cancer detection rate by up to 40% and reduce the corresponding rate of false positives.\nMammography to screen for early stage breast cancer at Tam Anh General Hospital\nUltrasound: Breast ultrasound is often prescribed by doctors if mammography is not sensitive. The strength of ultrasound is that it can evaluate the density and size of breast tumors; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Often indicated for cases of suspected multifocal or bilateral malignancy, especially ILC, and when assessing response to prior adjuvant chemotherapy, or when planning screening screening and breast-conserving surgery in high-risk patients, or those with hidden lesions.
