    "subsection_content": "Recurrent breast cancer is breast cancer that comes back after initial treatment. Although initial treatment aims to eliminate all cancer cells, a small number of cells may evade treatment and survive, multiplying, becoming recurrent breast cancer.\nCancer can recur in the same location as the original cancer (local recurrence) or it can spread to other areas (distant metastasis). Treatment can eliminate breast cancer that recurs locally, in the lymph node area or metastasizes distantly. Even if a cure is not possible, treatment can control the disease over the long term.",
