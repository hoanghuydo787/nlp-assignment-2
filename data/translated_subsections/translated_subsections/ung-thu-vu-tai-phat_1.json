Local recurrence\nLocal recurrence is when cancer reappears in the same area as the original cancer. If you have undergone extensive lumpectomy, the cancer may recur in the remaining breast tissue. If you have had mastectomy, the cancer may recur in the tissue of the chest wall or in the skin.\nSigns and symptoms of recurrence after extensive tumor resection include:\nNew lump in the breast or uneven firmness; Breast skin changes; Dermatitis or red skin areas; Nipple discharge.\nSigns and symptoms of postmasmoid chest wall recurrence include:\nOne or more painless nodules on or under the skin of the chest wall.; A new area of ​​thickening along or near the mastectomy scar.\n2. Regional recurrence\nRegional recurrence is cancer that has recurred in regional lymph nodes on the same side as the original breast cancer: including axillary lymph nodes or upper and subclavian lymph nodes or internal mammary nodes (inside the chest).\nRecurrent signs and symptoms include lumps or swelling in these lymph nodes.\nUnder the arms, in the armpits.; Near your collarbone.; In the groove above the clavicle.; In your neck.\n3. Distant recurrences - distant metastases\nDistant recurrences – most common distant metastases are bones, liver and lungs, contralateral regional lymph nodes (such as axillary or supra/subclavian lymph nodes, mediastinal or intrathoracic lymph nodes)\nSigns and symptoms include:\nPersistent and worsening pain such as chest, back or hip pain; Persistent cough.; Shortness of breath.; Loss of appetite; Lose weight in a short time.; Severe headache; Convulsion.; Contralateral lymph node locations such as axillary or supra/subclavian lymph nodes.",
