    "subsection_content": "Treatment options will depend on a number of factors including the severity of the disease, your hormone receptor status, the type of previous treatment, and your general health.\nYour doctor also considers your treatment goals and wishes.\n1. Treatment of local recurrence\nTreatment for local recurrence usually begins with surgery and may include radiation therapy if you have not had radiation therapy before. Chemotherapy and hormone therapy may also be used after surgery depending on the biology of the recurrent tumor.\nType of surgery: For breast cancer that recurs limited to the breast after a wide lumpectomy, your doctor may recommend another wide lumpectomy if safe, or a total mastectomy (mastectomy). ). If the cancer recurs in the chest wall after mastectomy, you can have surgery to remove the recurrence with a margin of normal tissue.; Local recurrence may be accompanied by hidden axillary lymph node metastasis. The doctor may remove some or all of the axillary lymph nodes depending on whether the initial surgery treated the axillary lymph nodes or not.; Radiation therapy is used adjuvantly after wide excision of recurrence to achieve safe margins. If you have previously had radiation therapy when removing a tumor, radiation to treat recurrence is usually not recommended because of the high risk of side effects.; Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Your doctor may recommend chemotherapy after surgery to reduce the risk of systemic recurrence depending on the tumor biology.; Oral hormone therapy including drugs that block the growth-promoting effects of estrogen and progesterone may be recommended if your cancer is positive for this receptor.; Targeted therapy. If testing shows that your cancer cells produce excess HER2 protein, drugs that target that protein will likely be recommended.\n2. Treatment of regional recurrence\nSurgery: The doctor can widen or remove the recurrent axillary lymph nodes depending on the level of recurrence and previous treatment on the axillary lymph nodes.; Radiotherapy. Sometimes radiation therapy may be used after surgery. If surgery is not possible, radiotherapy may be used as the main treatment for recurrence of supraclavicular or subclavian lymph nodes, intrathoracic lymph nodes (internal mammary lymph nodes).; Medications such as Chemotherapy, targeted therapy or endocrine therapy may also be recommended as the main treatment or may be followed by surgery or radiotherapy.\n3. Treatment of recurrence in the form of metastasis\nThere are many treatments for metastatic breast cancer. Options will depend on where the metastasis is and how extensive it is. If one treatment is not effective, other treatments may be used.\nIn general, the goal of treating metastatic breast cancer is not to cure the disease. Treatment may allow you to live longer and may help relieve the symptoms metastasis causes. Doctors always consider achieving a balance between controlling symptoms but minimizing side effects of treatment. The aim is to help you live your best life for as long as possible.\nTreatments may include:\nEndocrine therapy: If metastatic cancer is identified in a biopsy tissue sample and is positive for hormone receptors, you may benefit from endocrine therapy greatly, with fewer side effects than chemotherapy and be an option. choose the highest priority. If metastasis cannot be determined histologically, it is based on the biology of the initial step. For example, some metastases can only be diagnosed through imaging and cannot be biopsied; Valence. Your doctor may recommend chemotherapy if your cancer is hormone receptor negative or if hormone therapy is no longer working, the disease is more advanced, or has spread elsewhere.; Targeted therapy. If the metastatic cancer cells have certain biological characteristics that make them suitable biological treatments, your doctor may recommend these drugs.; Immunotherapy: Because cancer cells can produce proteins that help them hide from immune system cells. Immunotherapy works by interfering with that process, especially in estrogen, progesterone and HER2-negative triple-negative breast cancer. Immunotherapy is combined with chemotherapy to treat advanced cancer. [2]; Bone-strengthening medications BPs: Your doctor may recommend a bone-building medication to reduce your risk of bone fractures or relieve bone pain you may experience with bone metastases.; Other treatments. Radiation therapy and surgery may be used in certain situations to control signs and symptoms of metastatic breast cancer. For example, radiotherapy for spinal metastases helps relieve pain and prevent spinal cord compression, whole brain radiotherapy for brain metastases, surgery to remove cancer with isolated liver metastases or brain metastases, and spinal fixation surgery helps Stable spine,…\n4. Combine non-drug therapy\nMany people diagnosed with recurrent cancer feel miserable, sad, anxious, have difficulty sleeping, eating, or concentrating on usual activities.\nComplementary and alternative medicine therapies can help you manage side effects of treatment in conjunction with your doctor's care, including:\nArt therapy; Dance or movement therapy; Exercise; Meditation; Music therapy; Relaxation exercises; Yoga\nYour doctor can refer you to specialists who can help you learn about and try these complementary treatments.",
