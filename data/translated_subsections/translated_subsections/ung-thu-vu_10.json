    "subsection_content": "Can wearing a bra regularly cause breast cancer?\nThere are many theories surrounding this question. However, there is currently no scientific evidence proving that wearing a bra can cause breast cancer. There is a theory that wearing an underwire bra can restrict the flow of lymph fluid out of the breast, causing toxic substances to build up in the tissue. But according to a 2014 study of about 1,500 women with breast cancer, there was absolutely no link between wearing a bra and breast cancer. (4)\nDo men and children get breast cancer?\nHave. But the rate is very low. Men and children < 18 years old only come for examination when they have abnormal breast symptoms, and do not need to participate in regular screening.\nBreast cancer only occurs in middle-aged and older women?\nYoung women can still get breast cancer.

This percentage means that one in every 25 cases of invasive breast cancer occurs in women under 40 years of age.
