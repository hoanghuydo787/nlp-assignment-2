    "subsection_content": "The mortality rate from breast cancer ranks first among the causes of cancer death in women worldwide. Every year our country has more than 21,555 new cases and more than 9,315 deaths. Breast cancer in men accounts for about 1% of cases. (2)\nSome signs that suggest breast cancer include:\nBreasts change in shape and size;; The skin on the breasts, nipples or areola appears scaly, red or swollen;; When palpated, a lump is detected in the breast, or in the area around the breast such as under the armpit;; Inverted nipples;; The breast or nipple area appears sore;; There are indentations in the skin or thickening of the skin around the breast;; Discharge or bloody fluid from the nipple.\nWith dimples in the skin like orange skin dimples in the breast skin are called cellulite. In the early stages of breast cancer, the damage only affects the area around the breast. If not recognized and examined early combined with timely treatment, the disease will progress to more severe stages and affect the patient's health. many organs in the body.\nWhen cancer cells spread into the body, they will go through three main routes: neighboring tissue, the lymphatic system and the bloodstream. The invasion and spread of cancer cells in the body is called metastasis:\nNeighboring tissue: At this point, the cancer cells have spread from the disease-initiating organ and grown invasively into neighboring tissues.; Lymphatic system: At this time, cancer cells have spread from the disease-initiating organ into the lymphatic system and then move in the lymphatic vessels to reach other organs of the body.; Blood: After cancer cells invade from the disease-initiating organ, they enter the bloodstream and move right through the blood vessels to spread to other organs of the body.\nThe characteristic of a metastatic tumor is that it has similar properties to the primary tumor (initial tumor). For example, if breast cancer metastasizes to the bones, the bone cancer cells will behave similarly to breast cancer cells. This is called bone metastatic breast cancer, not primary bone cancer.\nAt this stage, the primary tumor metastasizes to tissues and organs in the body. In severe cases, it can lead to death. Therefore, screening is very important in finding signs of pathology before the patient is diagnosed. Symptoms of the disease appear. The goal of screening is to detect cancer at an early stage to help treat the disease completely. .",
