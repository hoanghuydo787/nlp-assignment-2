With non-invasive breast cancer, the cancer cells are limited to the breast lobules or milk ducts. With this cancer, the cancer cells have not grown or invaded normal breast tissue.\nThere are two types of non-invasive breast cancer: ductal cancer in situ and lobular cancer in situ. (3)\nInvasive breast cancer\nWhen cancer cells have spread beyond the ducts or lobules of the breast to surrounding breast tissue, it is called invasive breast cancer. Types of invasive breast cancer include:\nPaget's disease of the nipple;; Invasive ductal carcinoma;; Metastatic breast cancer;; Inflammatory breast cancer;; Invasive lobular carcinoma;; Locally advanced breast cancer;; Breast Phyllodes tumor.\nSubtypes of breast cancer\nOther forms of breast cancer are based on the genes the cancer expresses, such as:\nHormone receptor positive breast cancer;; HER2 positive breast cancer;; Triple negative breast cancer.",
