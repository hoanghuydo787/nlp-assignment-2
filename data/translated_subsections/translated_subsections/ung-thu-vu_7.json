Some surgical methods include:\nBreast-conserving surgery: Surgery to remove the malignant tumor and a few benign cells around the tumor, and not remove all remaining breast tissue.; Total mastectomy: Surgery to remove the entire breast. It is also called simple mastectomy. A few axillary lymph nodes can be combined; Modified radical mastectomy: Surgery to remove the entire breast, axillary lymph nodes, and part of the pectoral muscle.\nValence\nUsing chemical drugs to kill cancer cells or slow the growth of cancer cells. When performing chemotherapy (oral or intravenous), the drug travels through the bloodstream to find and kill cancer cells in the body. Chemotherapy can be performed before surgery, after surgery or when cancer cells have metastasized distantly.\nRadiotherapy\nBreast cancer treatment with radiation therapy is a method that uses high-energy beams to kill cancer cells or stop their growth. The way radiotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer.\nTargeted therapy\nIs the use of drugs or preparations that have a \"selective\" effect on one or more specific characteristics of cancer cell types. Compared to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, targeted therapy often causes fewer side effects on healthy cells.\nHormone therapy\nIt is a treatment method to remove hormones or inhibit the activity of hormones, thereby stopping the growth of cancer cells.\nImmunotherapy\nA treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer.",
