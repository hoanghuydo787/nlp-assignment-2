(2)\nThis is a rare disease, accounting for about 1% of all cancers. The disease most commonly occurs in adolescents and young people under 30 years old, but about 10% of cancer cases develop in people between the ages of 60 and 70. Bone tumors often appear in the bones of the hands, feet, and hands. leg bones or pelvis.\n2. Metastatic bone cancer (secondary)\nCancer can also spread or metastasize from another part of your body to your bones. Secondary osteosarcoma occurs more commonly than primary osteosarcoma.\nCommon secondary cancers include:\nMultiple Myeloma\nThe most common type, multiple myeloma occurs when cancer cells grow in the bone marrow and cause tumors in various bones. The disease often appears in older people. This is the disease with the best prognosis and many people with it do not need treatment.\nOsteogenic Sarcoma\nOsteosarcoma, or osteosarcoma, usually affects children and adolescents, but can also occur in adults. The disease tends to originate at the ends of the long bones in the arms and legs. Additionally, this type of malignant bone tumor can also start in the hip, shoulder, or other locations. It affects the hard tissue that provides the outer layer of bones.\nChondrosarcoma\nChondrosarcoma can occur in the pelvis, thigh and shoulder areas of older people. This is the second most common primary cancer involving bones.
