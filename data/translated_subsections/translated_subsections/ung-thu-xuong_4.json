These stages describe where the cancer is located, how it progresses, and how it affects other parts of the body:\nStage 1: does not spread from bone.; Stage 2: has not spread but may be invasive, making it a threat to other tissues.; Stage 3: the tumor has metastasized to one or more areas of the bone and is invasive.; Stage 4: the tumor has spread to the tissues around the bones and to other organs such as the lungs or brain. This is considered the final stage of bone cancer.\nDoctors can use the following bone cancer screening methods to determine the advanced stage of cancer cells:\nBiopsy, the analysis of a small tissue sample to diagnose cancer;; Bone scan, checking the condition of the bones;; Blood tests;; Diagnostic imaging includes X-rays, MRI scans and CT scans to get an in-depth look at the structure of the bones.",
