    "subsection_content": "Many people often confuse the concepts \"vagina\" and \"vulva\". These are words used to refer to a woman's genitals, but they are completely different. (first)\nVagina\nThe vagina is the tube connecting the vulva and the cervix. In other words, the vagina is the \"pipe\" connecting the uterus to the outside world. This is the path that takes the baby out of the mother's womb during childbirth, and is the place where menstrual blood is transported out during menstruation. The vagina is also the place that receives the penis during intercourse as well as contraceptive devices (female condoms, spermicides, IUDs...) and menstrual devices (tampons, menstrual cups).\nVulva\nThe vulva is the area that includes the external genitals in women. These parts include:\nOuter lips (labia majora): made up of skin folds surrounding the vagina and other parts of the vulva. The outer lips are covered with pubic hair; Inner lips (labia minora): made up of inner skin folds, smaller than the folds of the outer lips. The inner lips are not covered by hair, located between the labia majora and the vaginal wall.; Clitoris: is a small piece of tissue containing many nerve endings, considered the most sensitive part of the female genitalia. The clitoris is quite small in size (only the size of a pea) but will swell during intercourse or sexual stimulation.; Vaginal glands: considered the opening of the vagina, containing small Bartholin glands. These glands secrete fluid that acts as a lubricant during sex.",
