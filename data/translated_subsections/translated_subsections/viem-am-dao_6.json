Please note that you should avoid using tampons, having sex or douching before your appointment so that your doctor can assess your vaginal discharge most accurately.; Collecting a sample for testing: During a gynecological examination, your doctor may collect a sample of vaginal or cervical secretions for testing. The results will help determine the type of vaginitis you have.; Check pH: Your doctor checks vaginal pH by using a pH test strip or pH paper in the vaginal wall area. An elevated pH level indicates that you likely have a bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis. However, more tests are needed before the doctor makes a final diagnosis.\nThe doctor collects a sample of vaginal fluid for testing to detect early vaginal infections",
