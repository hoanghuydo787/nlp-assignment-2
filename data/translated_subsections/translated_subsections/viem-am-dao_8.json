Instead, take a shower.; Rinse soap/shower gel from private area after bathing. Do not use soap with strong cleaning properties, such as deodorant or antibacterial soap, granular exfoliating shower gel, etc.; Always keep the private area dry to avoid irritation.; Wipe from front to back after going to the toilet: This is to avoid spreading bacteria from the anus to the vagina.; Don't douche: Women's private areas do not need cleaning methods other than daily bathing. Repeated douching not only does not help with vaginal infections, but also destroys beneficial organisms residing in the vagina, while increasing the risk of vaginal infections.

Cotton fabric is cool and absorbent, so it will create a well-ventilated environment for private areas, limiting the growth of disease-causing fungi and bacteria.\nUsing condoms is an effective way to prevent sexually transmitted vaginitis",
