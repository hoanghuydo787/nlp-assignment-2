    "subsection_content": "Is vaginitis dangerous?\nMost cases do not cause serious health problems when treated properly. On the contrary, if not treated completely, vaginal infection can spread to other pelvic organs, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Additionally, women whose vaginas have been inflamed for too long have an increased risk of contracting STDs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea.\nFinally, you're more likely to have a premature baby if you get BV (bacterial vaginosis) while you're pregnant. Babies born prematurely are often underweight and are susceptible to respiratory, circulatory, digestive, neurological health problems... affecting later physical and mental development.\nIf the infection persists, is it possible to get pregnant?\nProlonged vaginal inflammation and excessive vaginal discharge will block the fallopian tubes, preventing eggs from meeting sperm. In addition, the vaginal environment is \"destroyed\" and will become unbalanced. Even if sperm can swim in, they cannot live here. Therefore, the ability to get pregnant will be seriously reduced in women with gynecological infections.\nIs not having sex at risk of causing vaginal inflammation?\nIf you think that vaginal infections only affect women who have had sex, change it now. Because even female children in puberty who have never been sexually active are at risk of gynecological diseases, including vaginitis. The cause is due to improper hygiene habits in private areas, wearing underwear that is too tight, using poor quality sanitary napkins, arbitrarily using vaginal medications without consulting a doctor...\nIs having sex when you have vaginitis harmful?\nIf your vaginal infection is caused by sexually transmitted agents, you should absolutely abstain from intercourse during the treatment period. Having sex during this time not only makes you uncomfortable but also makes the symptoms worse. In addition, you can also transmit the disease to your partner.\nFor non-sexually transmitted infections, such as chronic yeast infections (candidiasis) or bacterial infections, intercourse does not make symptoms worse. Therefore, you do not need to abstain from sex if you are diagnosed with these two diseases.",
