    "subsection_content": "Tonsils are two pink masses about the size of a thumb, located between the respiratory tract and the eating tract, so they are often exposed to dirt and food. The structure of the tonsils includes many cavities and compartments that make it easy for dirt and food to stick, accumulate and grow, causing inflammation and pus formation over time. The pus cocoons in the tonsil cavity often clump into clear lumps that look like bean residue, with a mottled green color, so the disease is also called caseous tonsillitis.\nThe disease is a complication of prolonged tonsillitis\nThis is one of the most common forms of chronic tonsillitis. The disease can occur at any age, especially in young children. If not detected early and treated promptly, it can lead to many dangerous complications, negatively affecting the patient's health.(1)",
