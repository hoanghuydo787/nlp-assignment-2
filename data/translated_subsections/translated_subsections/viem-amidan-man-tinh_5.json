    "subsection_content": "Chronic tonsillitis can be diagnosed using the following methods:\n1. GABHS test\nIt can be done through a throat culture alone or in combination with a rapid antigen test.\nWhen using a rapid antigen test, it is important to note that although this test is specific (88-100%), it is not sensitive (61-95%) and can give false negative results.\n2. Throat culture test\nIn the appropriate clinical setting, physicians may consider nasopharyngeal swabs to test for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HIV.\nIn rare cases, syphilis can cause tonsillitis and an RPR may be sent to confirm the diagnosis.\n3. Test for infectious mononucleosis\nTesting for infectious mononucleosis may be considered when Epstein-Barr virus tonsillitis is suspected.\nIn complicated infections, including patients with unstable vital signs, toxic manifestations, inability to swallow, oral intolerance, or trismus, further evaluation may be required.\n4. CT scan\nCT scan of the neck with contrast injection to rule out dangerous complications such as abscesses, Lemierre's disease and epiglottitis.\n5. Laboratory testing\nIncludes complete blood count and biochemistry profile to evaluate kidney function, which are worth considering.\nNasopharyngoscopy is one of the methods to investigate tonsillitis\n6. Differential diagnosis\nThe differential diagnosis for tonsillitis is broad and includes pharyngitis, retropharyngeal abscess, epiglottitis, and Ludwig's disease. The presence of a root abscess or peritonsillar abscess is also a possibility.\nKawasaki disease, Coxsackie virus, primary HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, and oral candidiasis may also present with sore throat and the distinction may be based on history and other clinical features.",
