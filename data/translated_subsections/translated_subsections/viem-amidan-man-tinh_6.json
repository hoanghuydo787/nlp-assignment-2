    "subsection_content": "Although tonsillitis is usually controlled symptomatically with good clinical outcomes, complications do occur. Although rare, abscesses, rheumatic fever, scarlet fever, and acute glomerulonephritis are possible complications.\nA peritonsillar abscess is a collection of pus between the pharyngeal sphincter and the tonsils, and symptoms of tonsillitis often precede their appearance.\nTeenagers and young adults are at the highest risk of this complication, followed by smokers, diabetics and immunocompromised...\nLemierre's disease is a rare complication of oropharyngeal infection. It often presents with sepsis following a sore throat with thrombosis involving the internal jugular vein and septic embolism.\nLemierre's disease is most commonly associated with Fusobacterium necrophorum, although it also occurs with Staphylococcal and Streptococcal infections. In the era of modern antibiotics, mortality rates are low although complications can include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), osteomyelitis, and meningitis.\nRheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease are more common in acute tonsillitis caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. However, this complication can also occur in chronic tonsillitis.\nRheumatic fever is an immunoinflammatory disease that occurs after infection with group A Streptococcus. It usually appears in patients aged 5-18 years. Although rare in developed countries, in developing countries the incidence is as high as 24/1000.\nThe disease affects many organ systems, most commonly causing arthritis, manifested by large joints that are often mobile, asymmetrical, and painful.\nCarditis affects nearly 50% of patients and often causes valvular heart disease, with the mitral valve most commonly affected.\nSydenham's chorea is a classic delayed manifestation of involuntary movements of the limbs and facial muscles associated with speech and gait abnormalities. Patients may develop a rash called erythema and subcutaneous nodules.\nPost-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is an immune-mediated disorder following group A streptococcal infection. Patients present with edema, hypertension, urine sediment abnormalities, hypoproteinemia, and increased signs. inflammation and low complement levels. Glomerulonephritis affects approximately 470,000 people globally, with an estimated 5000 deaths.\nChildren in developing countries are most often affected. The disease often occurs during outbreaks caused by group A Streptococcus strains that cause kidney disease. Most patients will recover spontaneously and return to normal kidney function, although the prognosis is worse in older patients.",
