For example, Tam Anh General Hospital applies Coblator Plasma technology, using a low-heat scalpel to stop bleeding on the spot to quickly remove all overgrown tonsils. Surgery time is only about 30 minutes, limiting the amount of anesthesia used. Children can talk, eat and drink 3 hours after surgery and leave the hospital after 24 hours. With this surgery, children do not experience pain so it does not affect their psychology.\nTonsillectomy surgery using Coblator Plasma technology is painless and stops bleeding on the spot, especially suitable for children at Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City.",
