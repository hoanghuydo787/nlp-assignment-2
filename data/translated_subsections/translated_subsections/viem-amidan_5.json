Acute tonsillitis\nThe first sign of acute tonsillitis is a body temperature of 39-40 degrees Celsius, a feeling of dryness in the throat and pain when swallowing or coughing. Further symptoms may appear such as a white tongue, red and swollen throat mucosa; The whole body feels tired, has loss of appetite, and shows signs of little urination and constipation.\n2. Chronic tonsillitis\nIf this condition recurs many times, it will lead to chronic tonsillitis with symptoms similar to acute inflammation but accompanied by a number of other symptoms such as:\nMouth smells bad; Fever returns many times; Feeling of lump in the throat when swallowing food or drinking water; Poor physical condition, weakness and possibly fever in the afternoon; Intermittent dry cough, expectoration with phlegm and often prolonged coughing spells; Voice changes due to frequent coughing, causing sore throat and throat irritation; Wheezing, snoring in adults, children may experience sleep apnea syndrome\nChronic tonsillitis can also cause tonsil stones. This is due to material particles such as dead cells, saliva, and food accumulating in the interstices of the tonsils. After a while, the debris can harden into small pebbles. They may fall off on their own, or require medical procedures to remove.\n3. Excessive tonsillitis\nHypertrophic tonsillitis originates from chronic tonsillitis. The pathogens present in the tonsils are just waiting for the opportunity to move into the overgrowth stage. When entering this stage, patients often have fever, sore throat, and swollen tonsils. Symptoms are similar to acute tonsillitis but will last longer. Hypertrophic tonsillitis occurs about 4 times per year.",
