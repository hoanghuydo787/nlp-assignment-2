    "subsection_content": "1. Acute bacterial cystitis\nMost cases of acute cystitis are caused by infection. There are many types of bacteria that can cause this urinary tract infection. Some known names include: Escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus proteus mirabilis, gonococcus, green pus bacillus. However, Escherichia coli is the most mentioned name with 80% of cases of acute bacterial cystitis being caused by this bacteria.\nWhen bacteria enter the bladder, they attack the mucosa and submucosa, the part that protects the bladder. Damaged bladder mucosa will become sensitive and cause typical symptoms such as frequent urination or urinary urgency.\nNormally, the mucous layer along with the urine excretion mechanism helps eliminate these harmful bacteria. When one of these two mechanisms is lost, or when the invading bacteria are large enough to overcome the protection, acute cystitis will occur.\nAs mentioned, due to differences in biological structure in the urethra, women have a higher risk of acute cystitis due to infection than men. Therefore, you need to pay attention to clean body hygiene to minimize infections that can lead to acute cystitis.\n2. Acute cystitis not caused by infection\nInfections leading to acute cystitis can also be caused by certain diseases or radiotherapy that cause the body to weaken its immunity and be easily attacked by pathogenic bacteria.\nSome diseases and health conditions can increase the risk of acute cystitis that affects the lining:\nWomen during pregnancy.; Women experience hormonal changes during menopause.; People with diabetes.; Perform radiotherapy.\nSome diseases and health conditions can increase the risk of acute cystitis that affects urine flow mechanics:\nProstate enlargement or prostate adenoma in men; Narrowing of the urethra or foreskin; Stone condition, bladder tumor\nBesides the diseases mentioned above, some medications, especially birth control pills, can also cause acute cystitis if the patient uses the wrong dosage or without the supervision of a specialist. Some medications that you need to pay attention to when taking, preferably through consultation with your doctor, to limit the possibility of acute cystitis include:\nBirth control pills; Drugs used in chemotherapy such as cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide; Spermicides\nAn additional note for women, the quality of feminine hygiene products is also one of the reasons for whether women get urinary tract infections or not. The chemicals contained in sanitary products, if not performed under professional, standard procedures, can cause bladder irritation and infection. Therefore, you need to pay attention to the quality of sanitary products to ensure that they are safe for urinary health when used.",
