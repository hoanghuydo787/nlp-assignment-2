    "subsection_content": "When a patient is diagnosed with acute cystitis, the doctor will prioritize a urine test to see the parameters of white blood cells and bacteriuria in the urine. Some other cases will require endoscopy or bladder ultrasound. However, acute cystitis does not affect blood and indicators, so blood tests to diagnose acute cystitis are not necessary. (3)\nDiagnosis methods for cystitis used at the hospital include:\nUrine test: A urine test will show the number of white blood cells and red blood cells in the urine. This is a diagnostic method based on paraclinical symptoms and doctors will consider whether there are abnormalities in white blood cell indices to reach a conclusion.; Urine culture: This method also requires the patient to collect a clean urine sample, using mid-section urine. With a urine culture, the doctor will look at the types of bacteria in the patient's urine. In addition to diagnosing acute cystitis, urine culture also helps doctors determine which antibiotics the patient needs.; Cystoscopy: With this method, the doctor will use an endoscope to insert into the patient through the urethra. The endoscope will show images of the bladder including current inflammation so the doctor can accurately diagnose the disease.; Bladder ultrasound: Bladder ultrasound is also a method of observing bladder morphology. The doctor can observe fluid retention in the urinary tract, detect tumors, and the surface and walls of the bladder. From there, determine whether the patient has acute cystitis or not.",
