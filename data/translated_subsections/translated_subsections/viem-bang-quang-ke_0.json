    "subsection_content": "Interstitial cystitis is a type of urinary tract disease that is not caused by bacteria. The disease causes pain in the pelvis, above the pubic bone or abdomen due to damage to the bladder. At the same time, symptoms of stinging or burning when urinating, frequent urination, and urgency appear. These are chronic clinical symptoms, patients can control and improve them, but there is still no definitive treatment. (first)\nThe bladder is an organ in the urinary system whose function is to store urine before it is discharged from the body. Interstitial cystitis causes the bladder to become inflamed. When the mucosal and submucosal layers are eroded, the bladder does not receive optimal protection and is vulnerable to adverse effects. From there, it reduces the patient's urinary health.\nInterstitial cystitis is more common in women than men, with 90% of interstitial cystitis cases being in women. A statistic from MSD shows that white people are more likely to get the disease than other groups. Interstitial cystitis is not a dangerous disease, however its symptoms can cause inconvenience for the patient in daily life.\nFurthermore, complications of the disease are related not only to urinary health but also mental health and are also an issue that patients need to be careful about.\nSee also: Cystitis in women: Causes, symptoms and prevention",
