Although the symptoms of interstitial cystitis are similar to acute cystitis, the disease is not caused by bacteria, so problems related to urinary tract infections are not the main cause of the disease. (2)\nBased on the results of the experiments, it can be seen that the physiology of interstitial cystitis is related to the loss of protective mucus in the ureter. Furthermore, urinary potassium is confirmed to be a factor that negatively affects the bladder.\nPotassiumuria can cause sensory nerve irritation and damage to smooth muscle in the bladder. Therefore, people with cystitis or interstitial cystitis are often prescribed to limit foods containing potassium.",
