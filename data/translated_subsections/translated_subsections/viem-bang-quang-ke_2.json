    "subsection_content": "People with interstitial cystitis will have clear clinical signs with pain in the pelvis, pubic bone, bladder pressure along with urinary urgency. Depending on each person's medical condition and health, the intensity of the pain will vary. Most symptoms do not appear initially, but they will make the disease worse because the bladder wall is continuously damaged and left untreated.\n1. Urgent urination\nUrinary urgency is one of the common clinical signs of interstitial cystitis. The patient will feel the need to urinate as soon as the need arises. In other words, patients with urgent urination find it difficult to control the urination reflex. For older people or children with interstitial cystitis, urinary urgency can lead to urinary incontinence or urinary incontinence.\n2. Unusually high need to urinate\nWhen suffering from interstitial cystitis, the patient has a higher need to urinate than usual even though the patient does not drink much water. The frequency of urination in a day for people with interstitial cystitis can be more than 10-20 times a day, while the number of urinations for healthy people is in the range of 4-7 times a day.\nBesides, people with interstitial cystitis will always feel bladder tightness. It often feels like the bladder is holding a large amount of pre-void and needs to be eliminated even though you have just finished urinating.\n3. Pain in the pelvis and pubic bone\nInflammation of the bladder wall causes spasms and a feeling of heavy pressure in the pelvis and pubic bone. The pain will be more severe when the patient holds in urine or the bladder is full and gradually decreases when the patient has urinated all the water in the bladder. Besides, the patient will also feel pain, burning or stinging when urinating.\nThe intensity of the pain will increase when the patient has sex, is stressed or has mental health problems, and during menstruation in women. Normally, these pain will not last continuously but will flare up at certain times. Therefore, patients should clearly understand their condition to prepare effective measures to limit pain during outbreaks.",
