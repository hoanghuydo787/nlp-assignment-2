Combined with the symptoms that the patient is currently having, there is a total assessment as well as a prognosis of possible urinary health problems. From there, an appropriate paraclinical diagnostic method is proposed.\nParaclinical diagnostic methods help doctors examine the state of the patient's urethra and bladder. If necessary, the doctor can also biopsy a tissue sample inside the bladder to get an accurate diagnosis. First, the doctor will test and rule out diseases related to urinary tract infections and bladder cancer. If the results are normal, the doctor will make a diagnosis of interstitial cystitis.\nTwo methods of paraclinical diagnosis of interstitial cystitis include:\nUrine test: The doctor will check the index of white blood cells, red blood cells and bacteria in the patient's urine. For test results to be accurate, patients need to get a clean, mid-stream urine sample to meet testing standards.; Cystoscopy: The doctor evaluates the condition of damage and inflammation of the bladder through images when performing cystoscopy. In this method, the patient is placed a specialized endoscope with a camera attached into the urethra, from there it goes to the bladder and examines the condition of the bladder including ulcers and the thickness of the bladder wall. radiation, signs of cancer, infection.",
