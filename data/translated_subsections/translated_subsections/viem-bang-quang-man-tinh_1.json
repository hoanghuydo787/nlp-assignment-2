    "subsection_content": "As mentioned, the causes of chronic cystitis are similar to acute cystitis but due to more prolonged exposure\n1. Microbial factors\nChronic cystitis is a disease that develops due to a patient having urinary tract infections for a long time or recurring many times. There are about 5 types of bacteria that cause the disease, but the most common is Escherichia coli, accounting for 70% of chronic cystitis cases. When bacteria enter the bladder through the urethra, they attack the mucosa, causing inflammation and swelling of the bladder. Eventually, symptoms of the disease will appear in humans such as painful urination, pain in the lower flank and pelvic area, sometimes accompanied by fever.\nWhen cystitis caused by urinary tract infection lasts or recurs many times, the patient will face the risk of chronic cystitis. At this time, the patient will not be able to completely treat the symptoms of the disease but can only control and improve them with medication or treatment methods prescribed by the doctor.\n2. Bladder conditions that are not treated properly\nAnother cause of chronic cystitis is that patients do not receive effective treatment for urinary diseases, especially cystitis.\nCurrently, the most popular and commonly used method by doctors to treat urinary tract infections is the use of antibiotics. This is a simple treatment method and rarely interferes with the patient's daily activities. However, if the wrong medicine is used, it will lead to the disease not being completely cured. Some cases make the disease more serious, including developing chronic cystitis. (2)\nSome urinary tract infections can be a precursor to chronic cystitis if not treated appropriately:\nDo not continue to completely treat urinary tract infection while the disease is in remission; Urinary tract infection due to disease or environment; Pain in the pelvic area that is not caused by bacteria",
