    "subsection_content": "1. Exposure to bacteria\nAccording to statistics, most cases of chronic cystitis are caused by bacteria. When your urethra is exposed to bacteria regularly, it increases your risk of urinary tract infections, specifically cystitis. In case the urethra is continuously infected, you will face the risk of chronic cystitis.\nSituations that increase the urethra's exposure to bacteria that you may have:\nHaving sex without using protection; Not keeping the genital area clean or cleaning it incorrectly; Abuse or improper use of birth control pills and spermicides\n2. Not completely treating urinary tract infections\nPeople with cystitis are required to complete treatment and not stop treatment midway, unless directed by a doctor to limit antibiotic resistance.\nMost cases of cystitis are treated with antibiotics. Patients need to follow the exact dosage prescribed by the doctor. If the patient stops treatment before completing the treatment course, it will increase the risk of reinfection in the future.\nSpecifically, even though the patient's body has relieved the symptoms of cystitis, the bacteria have not been completely destroyed if the patient has not completed the full dose of treatment. Furthermore, Escherichia coli bacteria have the ability to reprogram the lining of the bladder, making the bladder more vulnerable. The remaining bacteria can penetrate deeper layers of the urethral mucosa and cells. At that time, the intracellular colonies have entered a dormant state and are not affected by antibiotics and have sufficient defense mechanisms.\nTherefore, patients who do not completely treat urinary tract infections have a high chance of re-infection with cystitis and face the risk of chronic cystitis because the body cannot fully respond to the effectiveness of the medication. antibiotic.\nIn addition, other factors that increase the risk of chronic cystitis that you need to pay attention to include:\nWomen in menopause; People working in contact with chemicals; Drink less water\n3. Asymptomatic cystitis\nPeople with asymptomatic cystitis are included in the list of subjects likely to have chronic cystitis.\nAsymptomatic cystitis is not uncommon in urinary tract infections. Although the patient will not have to endure the inconvenience and pain caused by the disease's symptoms, asymptomatic cystitis makes the patient unaware of their urinary health status. And if the disease persists without treatment, it will develop into chronic cystitis. (3)\nSee also: Cystitis in women: Causes, symptoms and prevention",
