(4)\nDoctors will first perform a clinical examination of the patient to understand the patient's medical history and health condition. This activity helps doctors predict patients' diseases and health problems. Then, depending on each person's symptoms and severity, the doctor will prescribe appropriate preclinical examinations.\n1. Urine test\nUrine analysis is a common laboratory method when diagnosing cystitis or diseases related to urinary tract infections.\nFor a urine test, doctors will perform analysis and find out if there are disease-causing bacteria in the patient's urine. In some necessary cases, the doctor will perform a urine culture to obtain an accurate diagnosis. A standard urine sample is a clean, midstream urine sample so the doctor can observe bacteria and white blood cells in the urine.\n2. Cystoscopy\nCystoscopy is a paraclinical method that helps doctors observe images of the patient's bladder, thereby assessing the disease condition and appropriate treatment methods.\nThrough a specialized scanner inserted into the patient through the urethra, the doctor will diagnose the disease based on images. Although this is an endoscopic method, it does not require anesthesia when performed, so the patient does not need to stay in the hospital but can be discharged immediately after the endoscopy is completed.\nAdditionally, during a colonoscopy, the doctor may also take a tissue sample from inside the bladder and perform a biopsy when necessary.\ncystoscopy\n3. Take x-rays\nThe normal x-ray examination method lasts about 45 minutes. The doctor will place a urethral tube with contrast dye inside the patient's body to the bladder to take pictures.\nThe image results will let the doctor know the patient's bladder condition through its shape and size. In chronic cystitis, the bladder wall will be thicker than a healthy bladder.\nX-ray",
