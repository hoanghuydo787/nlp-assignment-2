    "subsection_content": "The most common cause of cystitis in women is bacteria from outside the urinary tract. When bacteria enter the bladder through the urethra, they will grow and attack the mucosa and submucosa of the bladder, causing characteristic symptoms of the disease.\nThe disease is more common in women because the urethra in women is shorter than in men. Furthermore, bacteria are more easily transmitted when the urethra, vagina and anus are quite close to each other. The inability to create an effective anti-bacterial barrier is the reason pathogenic bacteria can quickly enter the bladder. Most of the time, bacterial growth and development in the bladder can take place in a short period of time.",
