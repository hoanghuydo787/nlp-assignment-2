    "subsection_content": "1. Have sex\nCystitis often occurs after sexual intercourse in women. The risk of bacteria entering the bladder is greater than at other times because the urethra is now stretched. Sexual activity allows bacteria in the perineal area to easily enter the urinary tract.\n2. History of urinary tract infection\nStatistics show that 27% of women have recurrent urinary tract infections within 6 months of the first time. Therefore, the disease has a risk of recurrence in women with a history of cystitis if there is no appropriate prevention method.\n3. During pregnancy\nPregnant women will experience major hormonal changes. This cause leads to urinary health problems and creates a suitable environment for bacteria to grow and survive.\nOn the other hand, cystitis in women can also be due to residual urine in the bladder. For pregnant women, there are some cases where the fetus presses on the bladder, reducing the bladder's emptying function.\n4. Misuse of birth control pills\nBirth control pills are warned as one of the factors related to cystitis in women. Birth control pills can cause changes in the bacterial flora in the genitals.\nTherefore, when needed, you need to take birth control pills according to the instructions of your doctor or health professional to minimize unwanted side effects.",
