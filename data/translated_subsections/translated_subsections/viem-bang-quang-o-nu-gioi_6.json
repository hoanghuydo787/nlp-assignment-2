In order for the sample to meet standards, urine must be collected mid-stream. The doctor will perform tests or cultures if necessary. The urine sample will be examined microscopically to look for disease-causing bacteria or white blood cells.\nIn case you have symptoms of bloody urine, you need to immediately notify your doctor to perform more in-depth examination of your kidneys and bladder.\n2. Cystoscopy\nWith this method, the doctor will use a scope to observe lesions inside the bladder. The cystoscope will be inserted into the patient's urinary tract through the urethra. The doctor will observe the bladder condition and assess the level of damage to know the patient's health status. In some cases, through cystoscopy, the doctor can take a tissue sample from the lesion in the patient's bladder for a biopsy.",
