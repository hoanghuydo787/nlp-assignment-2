    "subsection_content": "Hemorrhagic cystitis may or may not be caused by a urinary tract infection. However, hemorrhagic cystitis occurs when harmful bacteria or toxins appear inside the bladder. This is considered the main cause of bladder damage, leading to bleeding.\n1. Due to chemotherapy activity\nPeople undergoing chemotherapy are more likely to have hemorrhagic cystitis than others. As for chemotherapy, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide are two drugs commonly used to kill cancer cells. However, you need to note that these two drugs have the ability to decompose into the toxic substance acrolein.\nTherefore, when acrolein reaches the bladder, the lining and bladder wall can be severely damaged and infected. This leads to bladder bleeding and hemorrhagic cystitis.\nIt should be noted that chemotherapy also increases patients' risk of chronic hemorrhagic cystitis compared to others.\n2. Due to radiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is one of the causes of hemorrhagic cystitis and chronic hemorrhagic cystitis due to weakening of mucosal function. The person performing radiotherapy must be exposed to ionizing radiation beams, which is the agent that causes blood vessels in the lining of the bladder to rupture. The effects of radiotherapy on the mucosa can last from several months to several years. Patients will be at risk of bacteria entering the bladder causing hemorrhagic cystitis. (3)\n3. Due to infection\nInfection is one of the leading causes of hemorrhagic cystitis, the most common being a urinary tract infection. Women are more likely to develop hemorrhagic cystitis due to infection than men because women's urethral structure is shorter than men's.\nEscherichia coli is the type of bacteria that causes 80% of hemorrhagic cystitis cases. In addition, proteus mirabilis staphylococcus aureus, gonococcus, and blue pus bacillus are also bacteria that cause you to have bladder problems.\nTreatment of hemorrhagic cystitis caused by mild infection will have better results than that caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Patients diagnosed with hemorrhagic cystitis due to infection should not worry too much but should carefully follow the treatment instructions from their doctor.\nSee also: Cystitis in women",
