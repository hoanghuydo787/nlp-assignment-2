    "subsection_content": "1. Clinical diagnosis\nFor any patient who comes to be examined for hemorrhagic cystitis, the doctor will ask questions and collect current symptoms along with medical history. This is a step for your doctor to understand your health condition and rule out risks from other diseases such as bladder stones and bladder tumors. Furthermore, based on medical history information, the doctor can also determine the cause of your infection, thereby prescribing appropriate paraclinical testing methods.\n2. Paraclinical diagnosis\nParaclinical diagnosis of hemorrhagic cystitis is laboratory tests or endoscopy, providing doctors with information about inflammation and bleeding of the bladder and bacteria in the blood and urine.\nParaclinical diagnostic methods that patients with hemorrhagic cystitis need to perform:\nBlood test: Based on blood test indicators, the doctor can diagnose the patient's blood infection. Besides, the doctor can also know if you are suffering from anemia or bleeding disorder caused by hemorrhagic cystitis.; Urine test: The doctor will observe the number of white blood cells and red blood cells in the urine. Patients with hemorrhagic cystitis have a white blood cell count in the urine above 104 white blood cells/ml. Another paraclinical sign in people with hemorrhagic cystitis is the absence of protein in the urine.; MRI or ultrasound: With this method, the doctor can observe the bladder morphology, especially the thickness of the bladder wall to draw conclusions.; Cystoscopy: The patient will have an endoscope inserted into the bladder through the urethra. Your doctor can observe bladder damage, including ulcers, inflammation, and bleeding.",
