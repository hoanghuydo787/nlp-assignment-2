    "subsection_content": "Bacterial cystitis\nCystitis is caused by bacteria entering from the outside through the urinary tract (urethra). A normal urinary system can prevent bacteria from existing and growing because they have difficulty sticking to the surface of the urinary tract mucosa and bacteria are quickly expelled. In addition, urine also has antibacterial properties, inhibiting the reproduction of bacteria. However, when the body is weakened, resistance is reduced or the urethra is damaged, bacteria will have the opportunity to penetrate and cause disease. Bacteria that commonly cause cystitis include:\nEscherichia Coli is the most common bacteria, accounting for 80% of cystitis cases.; Some other bacteria can also cause cystitis such as proteus, klebsiella, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia, mycoplasma, staphylococcus aureus or blue pus bacillus.\nOther causes\nInterstitial cystitis.; Radiation therapy, especially pelvic radiation therapy; Medicines: chemotherapy drugs such as ifosfamide, cyclophosphamide...\nSome factors related to cystitis include:\nGender: the frequency of the disease is higher in women than in men; Age: increases with age.; Unsafe sex; Long-term immobility; Pregnant women.; Menopausal women.; Have urinary tract abnormalities such as: urolithiasis (bladder stones, kidney stones, ureteral stones), prostate enlargement, neurogenic bladder, urethral stricture... or urinary tract procedures such as catheterization, endoscopy Cystoscopy…; Diabetes, HIV infection or cancer treatment; Long-term catheterization; Improper hygiene of the private area creates favorable opportunities for bacteria from the anus to enter the bladder.",
