In some cases it is necessary to culture for bacteria.\nCystoscopy: A scope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder to capture images inside this organ, helping the doctor observe and evaluate damage in the bladder. During cystoscopy, the doctor may remove a small sample of tissue for laboratory testing (biopsy).\nImaging tests: X-rays or ultrasound will help doctors detect urinary tract abnormalities such as bladder stones, prostate enlargement, urethral stricture, etc.",
