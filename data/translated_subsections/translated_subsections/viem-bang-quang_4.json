    "subsection_content": "If cystitis is not treated promptly, the patient is likely to face dangerous complications such as:\nBlood in urine: When cystitis progresses, the patient may urinate blood due to swelling and bleeding of the bladder mucosa.\nPyelonephritis: Caused by bacteria from the bladder moving back up to the kidneys, causing nephritis that can form fibrotic scars of the kidney parenchyma, leading to the risk of impaired kidney function.\nRisk of infertility: In men, the urinary excretion route in the urethra is also the ejaculation route, with a close connection between the urinary tract and genital tract. Inflammation in the urinary tract can spread to genital organs such as testicles, epididymis, and vas deferens; This leads to reduced fertility and increased risk of infertility.\nOveractive bladder: Prolonged or recurring cystitis can lead to complications with the nerves and muscles of the bladder, causing an overactive bladder and frequent urination due to the ability to hold urine. bladder's urine capacity is reduced.",
