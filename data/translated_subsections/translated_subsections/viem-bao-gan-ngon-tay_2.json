    "subsection_name": "viem-bao-gan-ngon-tay.json_2_Causes of finger flexor tenosynovitis",
    "subsection_content": "In most cases, tenosynovitis occurs due to repetitive motion or overuse of the finger leading to stress. In addition, this condition can also occur when tendons (tough bands of tissue connecting the muscles and bones of the fingers) become inflamed. (3)\nSpecifically, the tendons and muscles of the hand and arm work together to help the fingers perform bending and straightening activities. Tendons usually easily glide through the surrounding tissue thanks to the synovial membrane (membrane that surrounds the joint, has a lubricating effect).\nSometimes, tendons become inflamed and swollen. The tendon sheath is now irritated, which in the long term leads to scar formation and thickening, thereby affecting the tendon's ability to move. When this condition occurs, bending the finger, especially the thumb, will pull the inflamed tendon through a sheath, leading to a break or pop.\nSee more: Common symptoms of thumb flexor tenosynovitis\nThe danger elements:\nAge: Finger tenosynovitis often appears commonly between the ages of 40 and 60 years old.; Pathology: Diabetes, gout, rheumatoid arthritis...; Occupation: Farmer, worker, musician... (people who often have to perform repetitive movements on their fingers).; Carpal tunnel syndrome surgery: Tenosynovitis appears most commonly in the first 6 months after surgery\nThis condition is not common in children, but there are a few cases where it occurs. Inflammation affects the ability to straighten the finger, but rarely causes pain. At the same time, this phenomenon also has a high chance of automatically relieving itself when the child is 3 years old without needing medical treatment.",
