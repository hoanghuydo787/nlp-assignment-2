    "subsection_content": "Finger tenosynovitis can be easily recognized through a number of unusual symptoms, including:\nPain: The condition begins with a feeling of discomfort at the base of the finger, thumb or where the finger meets the palm of the hand. Usually, in the early stages, this is the only symptom. However, in the long term, if not treated actively, it will lead to pain even at rest; Swelling: Joint pain can cause swelling due to bursitis in the joint; Fingers are stiff or unable to move: Tenosynovitis can cause loss of the ability to flex and extend the finger. This can be estimated by flexing the finger as much as possible and then calculating the distance between the tip of the finger and the palm of the hand. Over time, patients tend to avoid positions that cause pain in their fingers. In addition, many cases still feel pain when trying to straighten completely, and long-term movement is also limited.; Some mechanical symptoms: Finger flexor tenosynovitis can cause abnormal sensation or movement, especially when performing flexion or straightening movements. The pain is usually mild at first, but as it becomes more severe, the pain can also increase.",
