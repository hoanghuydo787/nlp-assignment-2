    "subsection_content": "Internally medical treatment\nThe majority of cases are treated medically, including:\nRest: When the finger flexor tendon sheath is inflamed, the patient should keep their hand at rest and avoid movement because it will make the condition worse; Immobilization splint: to keep the hand in the most neutral position; Perform gentle stretching exercises: The goal is to reduce stiffness and improve the range of motion of the fingers.; Over-the-counter pain relievers and inflammation reducers such as Acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can help relieve pain and inflammation effectively.; Steroid injections: Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory substances often used to inject into the tendon sheath at the base of the inflamed finger. This can relieve pain for a few days to a few weeks. If the condition does not improve, the patient will be prescribed a second injection. However, steroid injections are less effective for diabetics and can even increase blood sugar levels. Therefore, after injection, patients need to monitor Glucose levels to avoid unwanted problems.\nSurgical treatment\nIf non-surgical methods do not bring about positive improvement, surgical intervention is the last option. This decision will be based on the level of pain or loss of function in the finger. In particular, when the finger is stuck in a bent or bent position, the doctor may recommend surgery to prevent permanent stiffness.\nThe goal of this method is to release the tendon sheath, preventing the flexor tendon from being compressed. Common complications Any type of surgery has the potential for complications. In the case of surgery to treat finger flexor tenosynovitis, before the procedure, the doctor will discuss with the patient about possible risks to prepare psychologically as well as treatment measures.\nSome common complications after surgery for finger flexor tenosynovitis include:\n1. Stiffness of neighboring fingers.\nInability of adjacent fingers to straighten after surgery, even if this condition was not present before.; Temporary pain or swelling at the surgical site.\n2. Complications are rare\nThe finger has a constant clicking phenomenon, which may be a sign that the tendon sheath is too loose or the finger has other problems.; Infection.; Nerve damage, causing numbness or tingling along part of the finger.",
