Although the incision will heal within a few weeks, swelling, pain, and stiffness in the hands and fingers may take 4-6 months to completely disappear. If it takes longer, the person may be advised to see a private hand therapist.\nIn fact, most cases experience significant pain relief as well as positive improvements in function after surgery. However, if spasticity or loss of movement occurs before surgery, mobility may not be restored.",
