    "subsection_content": "The cause of wrist synovitis is that this joint has to frequently repeat strong movements. This causes the synovial membrane to be subjected to too much stress and pressure over a long period of time, leading to inflammation.\nIn addition, there are a number of factors that can increase the risk of wrist synovitis such as:\nAge: As you get older, the cartilage that cushions the wrist gradually wears away, causing the space in the joint to narrow. This creates great pressure on the bursa, causing inflammation; Infection: Bacteria, fungi, and viruses, after entering the body through the blood, can attack the synovium of the wrist joint, leading to infection, causing swelling and pain.; Other diseases: Some diseases that affect the whole body such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus erythematosus, diabetes... can increase the risk of wrist synovitis.",
