However, if treatment is delayed, the patient may face some complications such as:\nImpaired joint mobility: This is the most common complication in people with wrist capsulitis when not treated early. The patient cannot even hold or lift objects due to the intense pain in the wrist area. This condition in the long term has a negative impact on many daily activities.; Bursitis infection: This complication is most common in people with bacterial synovitis. Bacteria when entering the synovium have the ability to multiply and develop rapidly. This causes the fluid inside to become infected. Even the outer synovial membrane can become infected and necrotic with symptoms similar to infectious arthritis.",
