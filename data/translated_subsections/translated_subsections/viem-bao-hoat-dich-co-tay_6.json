    "subsection_content": "Use medicine\nWhen treating wrist synovitis, the doctor may prescribe the patient some medications such as:\nNSAID anti-inflammatory drugs: Early-stage inflammation cases with basic symptoms such as swelling and pain often require non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen. The drug helps inhibit inflammatory processes in the body. Thanks to that, the uncomfortable condition is quickly improved.; Anti-inflammatory corticosteroids: For more severe cases, corticosteroids are often prescribed instead of NSAIDs. This medication is used to reduce inflammation, swelling and pain, but only applies to cases of bursitis not related to infection. Medicines are prepared in many forms such as creams, injections, oral medications.; Antibiotics: People with bacterial wrist synovitis are often prescribed antibiotics. The drug thoroughly destroys disease-causing germs and at the same time supports the healing of infected areas in the bursae.; Injection: When the disease progresses, the doctor may prescribe corticosteroid injections directly at the site of the inflamed bursa.\nSurgery\nWhen medical treatments are ineffective, the patient may be prescribed a fluid aspiration technique to remove all excess joint fluid, thereby preventing degeneration and damage of articular cartilage.\nHow often this method is performed will depend on the severity of the inflammation. Therefore, patients should only have fluid aspiration when directed by a doctor.",
