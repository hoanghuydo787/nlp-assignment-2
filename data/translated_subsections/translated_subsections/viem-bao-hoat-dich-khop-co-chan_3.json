Subjective failure to treat early can easily make the condition worse, thereby leading to a number of serious complications such as:\nThe inflamed area becomes permanently thick and enlarged; The expansion of the inflammatory area causes surrounding structures to be seriously compressed, causing pain every time you move; The pain limits the mobility of the ankle, and in the long term there is a risk of atrophy of the surrounding muscles.; Ankle bursitis occurs more often in women than in men due to the habit of using high heels for a long time.",
