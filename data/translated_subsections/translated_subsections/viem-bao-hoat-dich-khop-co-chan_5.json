    "subsection_content": "Non-surgical treatment\nFor mild ankle synovitis, the patient absolutely does not need surgical intervention. Some internal medicine methods that can be applied include: (4)\n1. Care and treatment at home\nKeep the ankle at rest.; Apply ice to the ankle area to help reduce swelling and pain. With this method, the patient can use an ice pack, then cover the bag with a towel before placing it on the compress site. Doing this regularly 3 - 4 times a day, for 15 - 20 minutes each time will bring significant pain relief.; Use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen and Aspirin to help reduce swelling, pain and fever. However, NSAIDs can cause stomach bleeding or some kidney problems. If you are taking blood thinners, you should consult your doctor before taking NSAIDs.; Using antibiotics to prevent or fight bacterial infections; Steroid injections to help reduce pain and swelling. However, in some cases, these medications can increase the risk of tendon injury, causing atrophy and infection.\nSee more: Ankle joint injection method\nUse padding according to your doctor's instructions to avoid injury and reduce pressure on the ankle area during exercise.; Use shoes of a suitable size to reduce pressure on the ankles, especially when walking.; Use a splint or cast as directed by your doctor.; If the cause of ankle synovitis is due to a medical condition, treating these diseases first is really necessary. For example, if inflammation occurs due to infection, the doctor will first prescribe antibiotic therapy for treatment, and then perform some other methods.; Walking is considered safe for patients and also brings positive improvement effects. However, patients need to use appropriate, well-fitting shoes, walk gently and not overuse them because it can easily make the condition worse.; Applying heat to the ankle area 3 - 4 times a day, for 15 - 20 minutes each time, also effectively reduces pain and stiffness.\nIn cases where bursitis occurs due to rheumatoid arthritis or gout, patients need to avoid certain foods to reduce related symptoms. As follows:\nFor gout: Patients should avoid foods and drinks that contain a lot of Purines such as wine, beer, animal organs, red meat, seafood... In addition, foods rich in Fructose are also in the group to avoid such as fruit juice, honey…\nReference: What should gout patients avoid eating?\nFor rheumatoid arthritis: Patients should avoid foods that can make inflammation worse, such as processed foods, cakes, foods containing corn oil...\n2. Physical therapy\nPhysical therapy exercises will help speed up the injury recovery process, improve range of motion and strengthen joints, muscles, and ankle bones. Specifically, patients can be guided in some of the following techniques:\nManual therapy techniques (MTT): MTT is performed by therapists, including soft tissue massage and stretching of joints to restore the ability and range of motion of the ankle. In addition, this technique also helps reduce pain effectively.; Therapeutic exercises (TE): TE includes exercises to stretch and strengthen muscles and joints. From there, the range of motion of the ankle is restored, the bursa and tendons are also brought to a stable state, effectively reducing stress.; NMR method: NMR exercises will help restore ankle stability, improve mechanical movement techniques (running, jumping...) to reduce stress on the capsule and tendons during daily activities. .; Other methods such as using ultrasound waves, cold lasers, electrical stimulation... will help reduce pain and inflammation effectively.; Physical therapy exercises at home: The main purpose is to strengthen, stretch and stabilize the ankle to help the wound recover quickly.\nOnce the initial inflammation has subsided, your physical therapist may instruct you on some stretching exercises to begin the process of restoring full range of motion. This is also a solution to improve strength as well as reduce stress on ankle tendons and joints.\nSurgery\nIf the condition of ankle synovitis is severe and medical treatments are not effective, your doctor may prescribe surgery. This is the best way to drain excess fluid from the capsule or completely remove the inflamed capsule.\nWith this method, the doctor will make an incision in the skin at the damaged site and drain the fluid. Once completed, the incision will be closed with sutures. This process does not affect muscle and joint activity at all, so it will help permanently reduce pain and swelling caused by inflammation. By eliminating the pain factor through surgery, most patients feel their symptoms improve immediately.\nAfter surgery, the doctor will advise you on some additional self-care methods to speed up the recovery process. Usually, the follow-up examination schedule is also specifically planned to ensure close monitoring of wound healing. The first time will start 1 - 2 weeks after surgery, the next time will be 4 - 6 weeks. Depending on the condition of the wound as well as each person's constitution, recovery time will vary. However, in some cases, ankle bursitis can also recur in varying degrees.\nIn addition, a new but not yet popular treatment is sclerotherapy. Specifically, the main purpose will focus on shrinking and killing stromal tissue by injecting irritants into the inflamed bursa. However, this therapy is not yet commonly applied and cannot replace surgery.",
