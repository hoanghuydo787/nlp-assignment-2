    "subsection_content": "Knee bursitis (knee synovitis) is an inflammation of the fluid-filled sac in the knee joint. The bursa helps reduce friction and is a force-bearing cushion between the ends of bones and tendons, muscles, and skin near joints.\nThe bursa anywhere in the knee joint can become inflamed. However, the area in front of the kneecap, inside the knee and below the joint is most susceptible to inflammation. This injury causes pain and limits the patient's range of motion. Treatment is often a combination of home care measures and treatments from a doctor to improve inflammation and pain.",
