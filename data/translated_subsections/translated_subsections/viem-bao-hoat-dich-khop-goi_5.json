Medical history and clinical examination\nIn addition to collecting medical history information, the doctor will physically examine the patient to assess the time of onset and severity of symptoms:\nCompare the condition of both knees, especially when the pain appears on only one side.; Gently press on the area around the knee joint to assess swelling, heat, and source of pain.; Inspect the skin in the affected area to determine if redness or infection is present; Slightly move the patient's knee to assess the range of motion and see if pain occurs every time the knee bends or moves too much.\n2. Imaging diagnosis\nTo rule out injuries that can cause symptoms similar to bursitis, the doctor may prescribe the patient to perform some imaging tests such as:\nX-ray: X-ray results help detect bone problems or arthritis.; MRI: This method uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to create detailed images of bone and joint structures. Thereby, the doctor can observe soft tissue locations such as synovium; Ultrasound: This method helps doctors better evaluate the swelling in the inflamed bursa area.\n3. Joint fluid analysis\nIn the case of knee capsulitis, if the doctor suspects an infection or gout, a joint fluid analysis may be performed. The patient will have some fluid taken from the bursa for examination.",
