    "subsection_content": "Some common causes of synovitis include:\nExcessive joint activity: The disease mainly occurs because the patient overuses the joint and repeats certain movements that cause damage to the hip joint. Because of its cushioning function for bones, tendons and muscles near joints, the bursa is easily affected by impact, increasing pressure over long periods of time.; Trauma: Bursitis occurs when the patient has an injury to the joint or surrounding soft tissues. The bursa is often inflamed right at the time of joint injury or progresses after the injury if not treated completely.; Pathology: Chronic autoimmune diseases can cause the hip joint bursa to become inflamed. This case is secondary bursitis. People with gout, rheumatoid arthritis, arthritis, bone tuberculosis, lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, infectious arthritis... have a very high risk of bursitis.\nHip joint bursitis can occur in any age group and any group of people. However, the risk will increase due to factors such as:\nAge: The natural aging process will cause the health and function of the synovium to decline. This increases the risk of disease in the elderly.; Occupational factors: The risk of disease increases in groups of people who work too hard or have sedentary jobs, sit a lot, or stand for long periods of time.; Athletes: Athletes and people who regularly play sports are at high risk of developing hip bursitis. Especially sports that require repetitive movements or certain activities that put great pressure on the hip joint bursa.; Overweight and obesity: Being overweight or obese can increase the risk of bursitis in the knee and hip joints.\nElderly people are at high risk of developing hip bursitis\nhttps://www.shutterstock.com/vi/image-photo/old-woman-who-has-pain-hip-1553304767",
