This method allows the doctor to accurately assess the problems occurring inside the joint.; Blood test: The method is indicated when the doctor suspects that the cause of hip bursitis is due to infection, tuberculosis or autoimmune diseases.\nDifferential diagnosis\nHip joint bursitis is often differentially diagnosed with the following diseases:\nHip osteoarthritis; Hip arthritis.; Rheumatoid arthritis.; Fracture.; Chondrosarcoma.; Gout.",
