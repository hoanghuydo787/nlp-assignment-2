    "subsection_content": "Non-surgical treatment\nUse medicine\nIn most cases, medication is prescribed to reduce inflammation and improve symptoms. Depending on the condition and severity, some pain relievers and anti-inflammatory drugs may be prescribed such as: (4)\nOver-the-counter pain relievers: Medicines are often prescribed for cases of mild swelling and pain, accompanied by fever. The medicinal effect is to reduce fever and relieve pain effectively.; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Drugs that reduce swelling, pain, and mild to moderate inflammation. Commonly used medications include aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen.; Steroid drugs: Steroid drugs are often prescribed for severe cases of inflammation. The drug has the effect of suppressing the body's immune system, thereby effectively reducing inflammation and pain. Depending on the severity, the drug may be prescribed orally or by injection.; Antibiotics, anti-tuberculosis drugs: Antibiotics or anti-tuberculosis drugs are prescribed for patients with damage to the hip joint bursa due to infection or tuberculosis.\nPhysical therapy\nPatients are instructed to perform physical therapy methods when hip joint bursitis is accompanied by stiffness and limited mobility. These methods will help relax joints and surrounding soft tissues, reduce pain, and increase flexibility and mobility for the patient.\nFurthermore, physical therapy also helps patients stimulate blood circulation, reduce muscle tension, reduce swelling, and is a very good support for the treatment of bursitis. Based on each patient's condition, the doctor will establish an appropriate physical therapy program, shortening recovery time.\nHome care measures\nIn addition to medication and physical therapy, patients can perform a number of home care measures to relieve pain, reduce joint swelling, and maintain mobility. Measures include:\nRest\nHip joint bursa lesions often improve when the patient stops activities and rests. Rest can help relieve pressure on the inflamed bursa. The hip joint and bursa will have time to relax. This is very good for the patient's recovery process.\nHowever, you should avoid lying motionless in bed for too long. Instead, you should walk gently when the pain has subsided. This will help limit joint stiffness and difficulty moving later.\nApply ice\nTo reduce swelling and inflammation, patients can use an ice pack to apply to the hip joint for about 15 - 20 minutes, 3 times a day. This method effectively reduces swelling, pain and inflammation, suitable for people with hip bursitis due to injury or overuse of the joint.\nApply warm compresses\nThis method is suitable for people with hip bursitis due to disease. The effect is to relax muscles, bones, joints and surrounding soft tissues, while stimulating blood circulation, reducing swelling and pain very well.\nIn addition, this measure also helps prevent and treat joint stiffness due to damage to the synovium, increase blood circulation and nutrition to nourish bones and joints, increase flexibility and improve motor function for patients. For warm compresses, the patient uses an ice bag or glass bottle filled with warm water and places it on the hip joint for about 15 minutes, 3 times a day.\nHealthy eating\nPeople with hip bursitis should eat a healthy and nutritious diet to improve the health of their bones, joints and soft tissues, helping to reduce pain and inflammation. In particular, patients need to focus on supplementing food groups such as:\nOmega-3 fatty acid foods: Salmon, tuna, sardines, herring, caviar, cod liver oil, almonds, oysters...; Anti-inflammatory foods: Ginger, garlic, turmeric...; Calcium foods: Milk, yogurt, cheese, nuts and beans, green leafy vegetables...; Vitamin D foods: Egg yolks, shrimp, mushrooms, oysters, tuna, salmon, cod liver oil, milk...; Vitamin C foods: Tomatoes, oranges, berries, cantaloupe, kiwi, papaya, bell peppers, broccoli...\nIn addition, patients should abstain from foods that can cause inflammatory reactions such as greasy and fatty foods, spicy foods, fermented foods, alcohol...\nStay active\nPatients should maintain exercise to prevent the risk of joint stiffness and difficulty moving, while also helping to reduce pain, inflammation and swelling. You should only move gently or perform light-intensity exercises such as yoga, yoga, etc. However, the patient should not run or walk too much, avoid vigorous exercise to limit the risk of pain onset.\nIf pain suddenly occurs or increases, the patient should immediately stop all activities and rest. You should only do light exercise and walk around after the pain has subsided.\nSurgery\nSurgery is indicated for cases of severe hip bursitis, affecting mobility. In addition, some other factors that may lead to surgery include:\nMedical treatment is ineffective; Patients are at risk of complications; Damage is irreversible.; Symptoms of joint destruction appear.\nCommon surgical methods in the treatment of trochanteric bursitis of the hip include:\nArthroscopic surgery\nArthroscopic surgery helps remove the inflamed parts of the bursa, thereby reducing pain and increasing mobility for the patient. However, after surgery, patients may face some potential complications such as joint deformity, bleeding, etc.\nTotal joint replacement surgery\nWhen joint and bursa damage cannot be reversed, the doctor may recommend total joint replacement surgery. This method uses artificial parts to replace damaged joints, thereby helping to maintain mobility and effectively reduce pain for the patient.\nSome potential complications of this treatment include dislocation, infection, blood clots... However, cases of complications occurring after surgery are very rare.",
