    "subsection_content": "Shoulder bursitis is a common medical condition in all ages, causing pain, swelling and redness in the area between the head of the humerus and the acromion. Accordingly, the synovium at this location are fluid-filled sacs that act as a buffer between bones and connective tissue, helping to reduce friction while supporting smooth functioning of muscles and bones. (first)\nThe study also showed that healthy bursae only have an average thickness of about 0.74mm, while inflamed bursae are up to 1.27mm thick, a difference of up to 0.53mm. Because the space under the skin is small, this change can also cause shoulder pain and fatigue.\nWhen a shoulder injury occurs or is overexerted, the fluid in the bursa will gather into clusters, leading to inflammation. The pain can appear suddenly and then disappear or last persistently and intensely depending on the severity.",
