    "subsection_content": "1. Rest\nShoulder synovitis often occurs due to inflammation, so bringing the shoulder to a resting state is a useful solution to reduce symptoms. Specifically, patients should avoid activities that tend to make pain worse, including some sports.\n2. Apply ice\nIce is an effective solution to reduce inflammation for shoulder bursitis. However, with each application, the patient should only apply it for 10 - 15 minutes. An important note is that for this condition, hot compresses are not the recommended solution because they can easily make inflammatory symptoms worse.\n3. Topical medication\nCreams applied directly to painful joints can also have positive effects depending on the level of inflammation. The mechanism is to anesthetize the nerve endings to reduce or completely eliminate unpleasant symptoms. This is also a solution to avoid side effects that oral medications can cause to the digestive tract. However, in all cases, patients should consult a doctor before use.\n4. Over-the-counter pain relievers\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used in the treatment of shoulder bursitis, including:\nIbuprofen (Advil, Motrin).; Naproxen sodium (Aleve).; Acetaminophen (Tylenol).\nHowever, over-the-counter pain relievers can still cause some unwanted side effects such as stomach pain, heartburn... Therefore, before using, patients should discuss carefully with their doctor to ensure ensure the best treatment results are achieved.\n5. Wear a shoulder brace\nThis solution will keep the shoulders and arms in a fixed state to avoid overuse. However, it is better for patients to discuss with their doctor before using to achieve high effectiveness and limit unwanted problems.\n6. Gentle stretching exercises\nPatients can perform gentle stretching exercises 2-3 times a day to help reduce stress on shoulder muscles.\nPosterior stretch\nThe patient can sit or stand, then bring the arm across the body, placing it on the back of the opposite shoulder.; Use your other hand to press behind the other elbow for a deeper stretch.; Hold this position for 15 - 30 seconds and repeat 2 - 4 times, then do the same with the opposite side.\nSqueeze your shoulder blades\nThe patient can stand or sit with their arms at their sides.; Pull the shoulders slowly back so that the shoulder blades touch each other, the front part is stretched.; Hold this position for about 6 seconds and repeat 6-8 times.\nShoulder movement\nRaise your shoulders like a shrug, then hold for about 5 seconds then lower.; Move your shoulders down to create tension at the top of your shoulders and hold the position for about 5 seconds.; Rotate your shoulders in a circular motion backward about 5 times, stop and repeat the movement but rotating forward.\n7. Physical therapy\nPhysical therapists will design a specific treatment program to speed recovery. Depending on the severity of the wound, healing time is different for each person. However, in general, physical therapy exercises bring positive improvement effects, helping patients quickly return to their normal lifestyle. Normally, if the program is suitable, results will be evident after 2 - 8 weeks of implementation.\n8. Corticosteroid injection\nCorticosteroid injections (Kenalog, Celestone...) are performed when over-the-counter medication methods, home treatments... do not bring results. However, patients should not receive too many shoulder injections because it can increase the risk of tendon rupture. Better yet, this method should only be applied when physical therapy, over-the-counter pain relievers, etc. are completely ineffective.\n9. Antibiotics\nIf bursitis is caused by an infection, the patient needs to take antibiotics to avoid the risk of bacteria spreading into the blood. In cases where oral administration is not possible, the doctor may prescribe intravenous infusion.\n10. Surgery\nIn rare cases, your doctor may recommend surgery for shoulder bursitis. Currently, instead of traditional open surgery, shoulder arthroscopy is preferred. This procedure is highly appreciated because it possesses many outstanding advantages in terms of both effectiveness and recovery ability. Accordingly, the doctor will insert small surgical tools into the shoulder through a small incision, including a camera to monitor the entire process.\nWith this method, bone tissue and synovium will be removed to increase space for the subacromial area, helping muscles and tendons move freely. Additionally, through this process, bone spurs can also be controlled (if any).\nShoulder arthroscopy does not cause much pain for many diseases during surgery and recovery time is also accelerated. After the procedure, the patient can go home the same day and return to normal activities after just a few weeks. In addition, this method also helps significantly reduce the risk of infection. This is a great advantage compared to traditional open surgery.\nAfter surgery, the doctor will advise on rehabilitation methods so that the patient can soon return to normal living habits. It could be an exercise program, designed with the goal of strengthening the shoulders. These exercises usually include weight training, stretching and some gentle rotations. When the wound shows signs of progress, the doctor will continue to adjust the exercise program with gradually increasing intensity to ensure the best results.",
