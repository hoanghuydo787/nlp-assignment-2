    "subsection_content": "Pyelonephritis is an infection that begins in the lower urinary tract, in the form of a urinary tract infection (such as acute cystitis). Bacteria enter the body through the urethra and begin to multiply and spread to the bladder. From there, bacteria reflux through the ureters to the kidneys.\nPathogenic bacteria are usually gram-negative bacteria such as E.Coli, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter. In addition, Gram-positive bacteria are still capable of causing disease but are more rare, such as staphylococcus, streptococcus, etc.",
