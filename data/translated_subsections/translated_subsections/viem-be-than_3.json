For example, people with urinary tract abnormalities in size or shape may face a high risk of pyelonephritis.\nIn addition, women's urethra is shorter than men's. Therefore, bacteria can enter the female body more easily. This makes women susceptible to kidney infections and at high risk of acute pyelonephritis.\nFactors that increase the risk of acute pyelonephritis include:\nPeople with kidney stones; People with kidney or bladder abnormalities; Elderly.; People with weakened immune systems such as people with diabetes, HIV/AIDS, cancer.; People with vesicoureteral reflux or abnormal vesicoureteral contractions (a condition where a small amount of urine refluxes from the bladder into the ureters and kidneys).; People with benign prostatic hyperplasia.\nOther factors that can make you susceptible to the disease include:\nUse a urinary catheter (catheter).; Cystoscopy.; Urological surgery.; Some medications.; Damage to nerves or spinal cord.\n2. Chronic pyelonephritis\nChronic forms of the disease are common in people with urinary obstructions. The cause may be urinary tract infection, vesicoureteral reflux, or urinary tract abnormalities (anatomical abnormalities). Furthermore, chronic pyelonephritis is more common in children than adults.",
