    "subsection_content": "If pyelonephritis is not treated promptly, it can lead to dangerous complications such as:\nKidney abscess: This is a condition in which pus appears around the kidney due to infection of the soft tissues surrounding the kidney. Without early intervention, patients can experience dangerous complications; Sepsis: This is a condition in which bacteria spill into the blood. Symptoms are severe systemic infection, which can cause septic shock and multiple organ failure.; Acute kidney failure: Dangerous complication of pyelonephritis. Symptoms include oliguria or anuria, blood tests with increased urea/creatinine levels. Acute kidney failure can potentially cause complications such as acute hypertension or acute pulmonary edema, which are life-threatening. If treatment is delayed, it can lead to chronic kidney failure.; Renal papillary necrosis: Prolonged severe infection can cause necrosis of the renal papillae, causing all or part of the renal papilla to die. The renal papilla is the opening of the collecting duct into the kidney. This is where urine flows into the ureter. When necrosis, the renal papilla peels off and then passes into the urine, causing obstruction of the ureter or urethra. If not intervened, this condition will cause worsening of the disease when pyelonephritis is present. From there, patients face a very high risk of acute kidney failure.; Antibiotic resistance: This complication can be due to the nature of multi-resistant bacteria and inappropriate use of antibiotics, not enough doses, not long enough.; Chronic kidney failure: Acute pyelonephritis has antibiotic resistance and frequent re-inflammation. When not treated promptly and properly, it can lead to chronic pyelonephritis and chronic kidney failure.",
