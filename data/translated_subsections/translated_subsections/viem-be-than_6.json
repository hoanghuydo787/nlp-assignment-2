    "subsection_content": "If patients with pyelonephritis have chills or do not respond to outpatient antibiotics for 3-5 days, their illness will not improve and will be transferred to inpatient treatment. If symptoms are mild, they will be monitored on an outpatient basis and antibiotics will be used.\nWhen a patient is about to use antibiotics, doctors often order a urine culture to look for urinary bacteria and blood. While waiting for bacterial culture results, the patient is given antibiotics and monitored and re-evaluated after 3-5 days of antibiotic response and continued adjustment or hospitalization for treatment when necessary.\n1. Use antibiotics\nFor cases without severe symptoms, antibiotics will be prescribed for 1 - 14 days orally. If the clinical condition does not progress well, the patient has a clear infection, still has fever, cloudy urine, pain, dehydration... needs to be transferred to inpatient treatment.\nAntibiotics are often prescribed for treatment such as:\nAminopenicillins: Used alone or in combination with clavulanic acid.; Aminoglycosides: Used alone or in combination with Aminopenicillins.; Aztreonam, 2nd or 3rd generation Cephalosporines; Cotrimoxazole and Fluoroquinolones.\n2. Hospital treatment\nCases are indicated for hospital treatment when symptoms are severe, pregnant women, and people with underlying medical conditions need to be hospitalized for monitoring and treatment. Treatment for pregnant women is often more difficult due to limitations in the treatment process.\nPyelonephritis in pregnant women often requires hospitalization. It can threaten the lives of both mother and baby. It may also increase the risk of premature birth. Pregnant women are treated with beta-lactam antibiotics for at least 24 hours until their symptoms improve.\nTo prevent pyelonephritis in pregnant women, urine cultures should be obtained between the 12th and 16th weeks of pregnancy. Asymptomatic UTIs can lead to the development of pyelonephritis. Early detection of UTIs can prevent kidney infections.\n3. Surgery\nPyelonephritis can lead to kidney blockage or septic shock. Both of these complications are very dangerous, with a high mortality prognosis.\nSurgery is often required to clear the blockage to remove any obstructions or to correct any structural problems in the kidney. Surgery may also be needed to drain an abscess that does not respond to antibiotics.\nIn cases of severe infection, nephrectomy may be necessary.",
