Anterior blepharitis occurs due to bacteria or dandruff on the eyelashes causing eye swelling and redness; Posterior blepharitis: Is the part located inside the eyelid where it comes into direct contact with the eye. It occurs when the oil-producing meibomian glands in the eyelids become clogged.\nUpper blepharitis affects the front of the eyelid",
