    "subsection_content": "Upper eyelid blepharitis comes from the following causes:\nStaphylococcal infection\nThe disease is caused by Staphylococcus bacteria, with symptoms such as thicker eyelid margins and misaligned eyelashes. Staphylococcus bacteria are found on the skin, nose, buttocks and armpits but can enter the human body through cuts, insect bites on the skin, and medical equipment (such as catheters). [first]\nStaphylococcus bacteria cause a group of infections, ranging from skin and soft tissue infections to invasive infections called staph infections. Among the many types of Staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus bacteria are resistant to methicillin (MRSA) and again some antibiotics such as flucloxacillin. In addition, Staphylococcus bacteria produce Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) toxin, which kills white blood cells, so skin infections easily recur. People with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to staph infections than normal people.\nAcne rosacea: Rosacea bacteria cause inflammation of the facial skin and eyelids.; Allergies: Ingredients in contact lens solutions, eye drops, and makeup can cause eye irritation.; Seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff): Dandruff flakes off and sticks to the eyes, causing irritation and inflammation of the eyelids.; Dry eyes: Dry tear ducts reduce resistance, making it easier for bacteria to attack and cause infection.; Lice or mites in the eyelashes (demodicosis): Demodex lice or mites block the eyelash follicles and glands, causing blockage and blepharitis on the eye.; Clogged oil glands: Clogged oil in the meibomian glands leads to dry eyes, infections, and blepharitis on the eyes.",
