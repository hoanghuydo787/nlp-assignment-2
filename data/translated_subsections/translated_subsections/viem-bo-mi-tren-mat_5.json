    "subsection_content": "When a patient has abnormal signs in the upper eyelid, the doctor will diagnose blepharitis using the following methods:\nAsk about medical history: The doctor will ask about symptoms and health status to determine risk factors for upper blepharitis.; Examine the outer eyelid: Based on the shape of the eyelid, redness, discharge and swelling help determine the severity of upper blepharitis.; Checking secretions: Eyelid secretions are tested to help determine the type of bacteria causing upper blepharitis; Tear test: Take a tear sample to analyze whether dry eyes are a factor causing upper limb inflammation; Check eyelashes: Eyelashes are examined under a microscope to detect whether lice or mites are present; Eyelid biopsy: Doctors rarely recommend an eye biopsy unless skin cancer is suspected or abnormal cells are present. First, the doctor anesthetizes the eyelid locally, then uses a needle to take cell samples and examine the skin under a microscope. After the biopsy sample is taken, the eye may bruise but there will be no scarring.",
