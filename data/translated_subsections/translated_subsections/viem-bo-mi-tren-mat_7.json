    "subsection_content": "To prevent upper blepharitis, maintaining eye hygiene is a top priority. Clean eyes help prevent blockage of mebomian glands and remove sebum and dead skin. Each person should practice some of the following habits to prevent upper eyelid blepharitis [3]:\n1. Remove makeup thoroughly\nWhen applying makeup, the eyes are usually the highlight, so it is necessary to use a variety of powders, eyeliner, mascara, etc. Therefore, makeup must be removed thoroughly and avoid makeup falling into the eyes. In addition, people with upper blepharitis should not wear makeup in the eye area even if symptoms have improved. Even with successful treatment, upper blepharitis can recur, so it is important to maintain a daily eye hygiene routine.\n2. Clean hands, face and scalp\nKeep your eyelids, skin and hair clean, helping to control symptoms of upper blepharitis. People should clean their eyes every day with clean water and wash their hair with antibacterial shampoo. Additionally, combine some disinfectant sprays on the skin to prevent bacteria from growing.\nTreat upper blepharitis with eye drops\n3. Avoid touching your eyes\nHands that perform many activities during the day such as holding, grasping, etc. can easily accumulate bacteria, so you should not rub your eyes. When your eyes feel itchy or uncomfortable, wash your hands thoroughly with soap before touching your eyes. After washing your hands, carefully rinse your eyelids and eyelashes and use a dry towel to wipe your eyes.\nFor people who have blepharitis, they should keep their hands clean and limit rubbing their eyes to prevent it from getting worse.\n4. Use eye drops\nDuring treatment of upper blepharitis, patients can use artificial tears to help reduce dry eye symptoms. Artificial tears contain 0.18% sodium hyaluronate, which has been shown to be effective in treating dry eyes.\n5. Limit contact lenses\nWearing contact lenses affects the circulation and exchange of the tear film between the lens and the corneal surface. In particular, with soft contact lenses, because they have a certain hydration rate, if worn regularly, they will cause dry eyes. Patients will have symptoms such as burning, glare, and watery eyes.\nTherefore, contact lens users should see an ophthalmologist for examination and advice on choosing the right medication for the type of contact lenses they are wearing.\nIf there are signs of mild dry eyes, it is necessary to change to contact lenses from another material (hard contact lenses or soft contact lenses with low hydration) and reduce the time of wearing glasses, supplementing with artificial tears.\nIn addition, storing contact lenses without ensuring hygiene leads to the invasion of pathogens with symptoms such as red eyes, scratches, discharge from the eyes... even pain and blurred vision.\nOphthalmology Department, Tam Anh General Hospital System has a team of doctors and nurses with high expertise and many years of experience in treating eye diseases. And the system of modern machinery and equipment helps improve the condition of upper eyelid blepharitis effectively.\nBlepharitis on the eye does not cause permanent corneal damage but causes pain and discomfort for the patient and is easy to recur. Therefore, as soon as you detect unusual signs in your eyes such as swelling, redness, etc., you should immediately go to a hospital where there is an Eye specialist for timely examination, diagnosis and treatment.",
