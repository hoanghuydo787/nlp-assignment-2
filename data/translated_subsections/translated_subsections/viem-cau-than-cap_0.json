    "subsection_content": "Acute glomerulonephritis is a group of diseases that damage the glomeruli, affecting the body's ability to filter blood, waste and urine. (first)\nThe glomerulus is a bundle of capillaries lined by a thin layer of endothelium. This is a complex network of proteins and specialized visceral epithelial cells that form diaphragms. This combined structure allows the glomerulus to perform continuous plasma filtration.\nWhen the glomerulus, including glomeruli and blood vessels, is damaged leading to sudden inflammation, the function of the glomerulus will be impaired. This causes symptoms such as hematuria, anemia, hypertension or edema.\nMore specifically, when the glomeruli are damaged by acute glomerulonephritis, instead of keeping proteins and red blood cells in the blood, acute glomerulonephritis will leak red blood cells and proteins into the urine. This will lead to a lack of protein in the blood, causing swelling in the face, hands, feet and ankles. In addition, the patient's body will also accumulate waste because the kidneys cannot perform the filtering function.\nAcute glomerulonephritis is very diverse. Mostly due to infection, family inheritance or changes in the immune system due to diseases related to inflammation. Acute glomerulonephritis has the ability to improve on its own without treatment. However, patients are still recommended to receive complete treatment to minimize the risk of long-term damage to the kidneys.",
