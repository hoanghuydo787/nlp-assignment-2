    "subsection_content": "1. Infection\nPostinfectious glomerulonephritis belongs to the first group of acute glomerulonephritis. People with infection-related illnesses are more likely to develop acute glomerulonephritis than others.\nThis is because infections such as pharyngitis, pharyngitis or streptococcal bacterial infection will cause changes in the human immune system. From there, the risk of acute glomerulonephritis in humans increases.\nInfections that can cause acute glomerulonephritis include:\nPost-streptococcal glomerulonephritis: Streptococcal pharyngitis or infections; Bacterial endocarditis: Infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves; Viral kidney infection: Reverse infection when the patient has hepatitis B or C; HIV: The disease can cause acute glomerulonephritis. In some cases, acute glomerulonephritis can progress faster than HIV\n2. Autoimmune disease\nWhen a person's immune system loses the ability to distinguish between external agents and antigens inside the body, it can cause a number of diseases. These diseases are considered the cause of acute glomerulonephritis.\nAutoimmune diseases that require prevention of acute glomerulonephritis include:\nLupus erythematosus; goodpasture syndrome; IgA or berger nephropathy\n3. Vasculitis\nVasculitis is a condition in which blood vessels become thickened, narrowed, or scarred due to vascular damage. The disease causes changes in blood vessel walls, hindering blood flow. The consequence of prolonged and improperly treated vasculitis is organ and tissue damage.\nTypes of vasculitis that can cause glomerulonephritis are polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis.",
