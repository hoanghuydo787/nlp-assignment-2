However, medical experts and doctors recommend that people with acute glomerulonephritis should see a doctor as soon as their body begins to have symptoms of the disease.\nThis helps patients treat the disease promptly and properly to minimize the risk of developing other more dangerous kidney diseases. In addition, the doctor will also rely on the patient's medical history and clinical signs to predict the development of acute glomerulonephritis.\nAt the same time, evaluate potential kidney or urinary health risks that the patient may suffer in the future, along with advice on effective prevention.",
