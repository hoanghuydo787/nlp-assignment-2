Therefore, urine testing is considered the optimal method to diagnose acute glomerulonephritis.\nUrine test results will show the following indicators:\nClearance of waste products filtered by the kidneys, also known as creatinine; Amount of protein in urine; Red blood cells in urine; Concentration of urine\n2. Blood test\nWith the method of diagnosing acute glomerulonephritis using blood test results mainly to check creatinine levels, waste filtered by the patient's kidneys. The doctor will rely on blood levels to diagnose whether the patient has acute glomerulonephritis or not.\nBlood test results show:\nRed blood cell concentration in the blood; Albumin concentration; Urine nitrogen concentration in the blood; Blood creatinine concentration\n3. Kidney biopsy\nKidney biopsy is a method that provides specific results about the disease. To get a piece of kidney tissue from the patient, the doctor will use a long needle to insert into the back to reach the kidney and perform a biopsy.\nPeople with abnormal urine or blood indexes will be prescribed a kidney biopsy by the doctor to better diagnose the disease.",
