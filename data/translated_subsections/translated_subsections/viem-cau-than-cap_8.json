When the glomerulus is suddenly damaged, it leads to inflammation, causing red blood cells and proteins to leak into the urine. Therefore, acute glomerulonephritis can be recognized through typical clinical signs of hematuria and foamy urine.\nThe disease is caused by many causes and there is no specific absolute prevention measure. However, glomerulonephritis can go away on its own without medication. To support the recovery process and improve inflamed glomeruli, patients are encouraged to change their diet to be rich in green vegetables, low in salt and control the amount of potassium in the body.",
