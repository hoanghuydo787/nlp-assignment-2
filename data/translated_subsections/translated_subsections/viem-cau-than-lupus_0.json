    "subsection_content": "Lupus glomerulonephritis is an inflammation of the kidneys caused by systemic lupus erythematosus. Lupus is an autoimmune disease. In people with this disease, instead of attacking agents that harm the body, the immune system attacks healthy tissues and organs, including the kidneys.\nThis causes kidney inflammation and can lead to blood in the urine, protein in the urine, high blood pressure, decreased kidney function or even kidney failure. About 60% of people with systemic lupus erythematosus develop glomerulonephritis. (first)\nIn 2003, the International Society of Nephrology and the Society of Renal Pathology divided lupus nephritis into 6 stages, including:\nStage I: Mild glomerular damage, the patient has no clinical manifestations, urine tests and kidney function are normal.; Stage II: Lupus mesangial glomerulonephritis. At this time, kidney damage begins to become more obvious with symptoms such as blood in the urine, possibly accompanied by low proteinuria, and more rarely, nephrotic syndrome.; Stage III: Localized proliferative glomerulonephritis. The blood vessels that feed the kidneys are damaged, some patients in this group have impaired kidney function and about 1⁄3 cases have nephrotic syndrome. Increased protein in blood and urine; Stage IV: Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis. At this time, more than 50% of important blood vessels in the kidney are damaged, the patient has nephrotic syndrome, accompanied by decreased kidney function.; Stage V: Membranous glomerulonephritis has the most common clinical manifestation of nephrotic syndrome. At this time, the patient may be prescribed dialysis or a kidney transplant.; Stage VI: Glomerulosclerosis is common in people who have had nephritis several years ago. Clinical manifestations include kidney failure, high blood pressure, and nephrotic syndrome. More than 90% of important blood vessels in the kidneys lose their ability to function.",
