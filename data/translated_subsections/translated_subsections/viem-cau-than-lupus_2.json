Different people may have different symptoms, but in general they include:\nWeight gain; High Blood Pressure; Dark urine; Foaming or blood in urine; Increased need to urinate, especially at night\nIn addition, because disease symptoms do not appear frequently and tend to be intermittent, kidney damage is detected mainly through urine test results.\nIt should be noted that not all urinary problems in people with systemic lupus erythematosus are signs of lupus glomerulonephritis. Sometimes, it can be a sign of a urinary tract infection.",
