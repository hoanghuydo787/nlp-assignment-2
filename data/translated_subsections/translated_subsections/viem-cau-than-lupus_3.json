    "subsection_content": "Diagnosis of lupus glomerulonephritis will begin with a medical history, physical examination, and assessment of symptoms. After that, the doctor will prescribe necessary tests or diagnostic imaging, including:\n1. Blood and urine tests\nBlood tests to assess the concentration of waste products such as creatinine and urea; Collect 24-hour urine to measure the kidney's ability to filter waste and determine protein concentration in urine; Urine tests to check kidney function, measuring protein levels, red blood cells and white blood cells; The Iothalamate clearance test is performed by injecting radioactive Iothalamate into the patient's blood, then testing the rate at which the substance is filtered from the blood and excreted in the urine.\n2. Kidney biopsy\nA biopsy is the most accurate way to diagnose kidney disease. The doctor will insert a long needle through the patient's abdomen and into the kidney, then take a sample of kidney tissue to analyze for signs of damage. Through the biopsy results, the doctor will determine the stage of the disease and provide appropriate treatment.\n3. Ultrasound\nDuring an ultrasound, sound waves will be used to create detailed images of the patient's kidneys. The doctor will rely on these images to detect kidney abnormalities such as shape, size, etc.",
