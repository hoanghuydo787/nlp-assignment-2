Treatments are only aimed at reducing symptoms, slowing the progression of the disease, and reducing the risk of dialysis and kidney transplantation. Depending on each specific medical condition, the doctor will prescribe the following medications:\nCorticosteroids help reduce inflammation and are often prescribed until the inflammation improves. However, this medicine can cause serious side effects, so patients need to follow their doctor's instructions.; Immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, voclosporin, mycophenolate... have the ability to inhibit the activity of the immune system, causing damage to the kidneys.; Medications to control blood pressure such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). These medications also prevent protein from leaking from the kidneys into the urine.; It helps prevent blood clots from forming if necessary.\nEven with treatment, loss of kidney function can continue to develop. If drug treatment is no longer as effective as expected, the patient will need dialysis. Dialysis helps remove fluid and waste from the body, maintain a balance of minerals in the blood, and control blood pressure.\nThe ultimate treatment for lupus kidney disease is a kidney transplant.",
