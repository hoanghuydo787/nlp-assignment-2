    "subsection_content": "Chronic glomerulonephritis includes two groups of symptoms: the group of symptoms of chronic kidney disease based on urine abnormalities (proteinuria, erythropoiesis) and abnormal images through kidney ultrasound; group of symptoms of impaired kidney function, characterized by reduced glomerular filtration rate.\nTherefore, the US National Kidney Foundation (NKF) guides the classification of chronic kidney disease into five stages, from kidney disease to end-stage kidney failure. This classification helps determine the appropriate treatment strategy for each stage and is now widely used around the world.\nStage 1: kidney function is normal. The patient has chronic kidney disease but the glomerular filtration rate is still normal (³ 90 ml/min). The treatment strategy in this stage is to diagnose the disease, find the cause of the disease and treat it to slow down disease progression and reduce cardiovascular risks.; Stage 2: reduced kidney function (mild kidney failure). This stage is characterized by patients with chronic kidney disease, kidney damage has reduced kidney function, and glomerular filtration rate is 60-89 ml/min. The treatment strategy in this phase is to assess progression and treat to slow disease progression.; Stage 3: moderate kidney failure. The characteristic of this stage is that the glomerular filtration rate is between 30-59 ml/min. The treatment strategy  in this phase is to assess, prevent and treat complications.; Stage 4: severe kidney failure. The characteristic of this stage is that the glomerular filtration rate is greatly reduced to 15-29 ml/min. The treatment plan at this stage is to prepare for renal replacement therapy.; Stage 5: very severe kidney failure (end-stage kidney failure). Characteristic of this stage is the severity of kidney failure symptoms, with the glomerular filtration rate being less than 15 ml/min. Treatment during this stage is renal replacement therapy.",
