Primary chronic glomerulonephritis\nPrimary chronic glomerulonephritis is chronic glomerulonephritis of unknown etiology, glomerular damage is due to immune mechanisms.\n1.1 Forms of immune complex deposition in the glomerulus:\nImmune complexes circulate in the blood and then deposit in the glomerulus. Such as systemic lupus erythematosus, IgA nephropathy.; The structural components of the glomerulus are themselves antigenic. Antigens stimulate the body to produce antibodies, the antigen-antibody reaction occurs in the glomerulus. A typical example of this form is Goodpasture syndrome. In Goodpasture syndrome, the antigen is the a3 chain of type IV collagen in the glomerular basement membrane structure; Free antigens circulate in the blood and are \"implanted\" into the glomerulus, the antigen-antibody reaction occurs in the glomerulus. Typically this form is seen in systemic lupus erythematosus. The histone-DNA complex is an antigen in lupus, circulates in the blood and when it reaches the cell surface and glomerular basement membrane is \"implanted\" into this organization. This antigen is the target of anti-DNA antibodies.\n1.2 Antigens\nExcept for postinfectious glomerulopathies, antiglomerular basement membrane antibody disease and polymorphonuclear leukocyte cytoplasmic antibody disease have known antigens. Other primary chronic glomerulonephritis have not yet identified antigens. It is believed that there are two sources of antigens: exogenous antigens and endogenous antigens.; Exogenous antigens, which can be components of microorganisms or foreign substances entering the body; Endogenous antigens, which can be abnormal proteins produced under the action of microbial enzymes, abnormal proteins produced by tumors, or the patient's own IgG is changed to become Autoantigens due to dysfunction of the immune system; Antigen-antibody reactions create antigen-antibody complexes (immune complexes) that circulate in the blood. If there are few antigens and an excess of antibodies, the resulting immune complex is usually large in size, will be captured, destroyed by cells of the reticuloendothelial system, and removed from the circulatory system.; If there are few antibodies and excess antigens, the immune complexes formed are often small in size and pass through the control of reticuloendothelial cells and exist in the blood circulation. Immune complexes will be deposited in the glomerulus during the glomerular blood filtration process.\nDeposition sites of immune complexes in the glomerulus. Depending on the size and charge of the immune complexes, they can be deposited in different locations in the glomerulus. There are four sites of immune complex deposition in the glomerulus:\nImmune complex deposition under endothelial cells (in the space between the endothelial cell and the basement membrane).; Immune complex deposition in the glomerular basement membrane causes the basement membrane to thicken and can split the basement membrane to form spicules (membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis types 1 and 3). If it is deposited mainly in the dense layer of the basement membrane, it is called solid deposition disease (membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type 2).; Deposition of immune complexes under epithelial cells (podocyt), immune complexes located in the space between epithelial cells and basement membrane.; Complex deposition in the mesangial space.\n1.3 Inflammatory process in the glomerulus\nThe inflammatory process in the glomeruli is a sterile inflammatory process, due to antigen-antibody interactions and immune complex deposition in the glomeruli that activate the complement system, activating polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes. nucleus, mast cells, activation of the kinin system, coagulation system, to eliminate immune complexes; The consequence of the above process is inflammation and damage to the glomerulus, changing the permeability of the glomerular basement membrane, allowing the glomerulus to leak red blood cells and proteins into the urine.; The inflammatory process in the glomeruli does not end and becomes progressively worse because the antigen is not clearly known and has not been eliminated. At the same time, the inflammatory process in the glomeruli itself causes the release of mediators. causing inflammation (inflammatory mediators), leukocyte chemotactic agents, degrading enzymes, or disorders of the immune system that cause the inflammatory process to continue to progress.; Inflammatory response in the glomerulus is manifested by proliferation of glomerular cells such as mesangial cells and endothelial cells. Swelling of endothelial cells and epithelial cells. Epithelial cell foot fusion. Infiltration of inflammatory cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes into the glomerulus. Thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, expansion of the mesangial space and increased mesangial proliferation; Proliferative mesangial material can spill from the mesangial space into the space between the endothelial cells and the glomerular basement membrane, forming a double border (rail shape) of the glomerular basement membrane. Deposition of immune complexes, complement, and fibrin in the glomerulus. The above changes gradually cause glomerulosclerosis, the fibrotic glomeruli are eliminated from the functional circle.; The number of glomeruli eliminated from the functional cycle is increasing, causing kidney function to decline more and more severely and irreversibly, eventually both kidneys no longer function, the patient has end-stage kidney failure.\n1.4 Some types of histopathological lesions\nMinimal glomerular damage; Segmental segmental glomerulonephritis; Diffuse glomerulonephritis:; Membranous glomerulonephritis\n2.
