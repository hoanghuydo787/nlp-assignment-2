    "subsection_content": "The first health effects of chronic glomerulonephritis are the accumulation of waste or toxins in the blood. Because when the glomerulus has a reduced ability to filter urine and waste due to damage, it will not be able to function as effectively as a healthy glomerulus.\nIn addition, patients may also experience inhibition of the kidney's role in regulating blood pressure, loss of protein in the blood, and loss of red blood cells.\nIf people with chronic glomerulonephritis do not receive treatment to control the health of their glomeruli, over time the disease will develop into life-threatening complications. Possible complications of chronic glomerulonephritis include:\nChronic kidney failure and end-stage kidney failure; High blood pressure, possible paroxysmal hypertension, congestive heart failure; Nephrotic syndrome; Glomerulonephritis progresses rapidly; Blood complications: anemia, bleeding; Bone complications; Osteoporosis, osteomalacia",
