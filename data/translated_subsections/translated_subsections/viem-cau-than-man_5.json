Therefore, patients need to see a doctor as soon as they have symptoms suspected of being glomerulonephritis.\nIn addition, medical experts recommend that each person should have a general health check-up twice a year. Speaking specifically about chronic glomerulonephritis, the disease often has no symptoms in the early stages.\nHowever, through the results of general health examinations, patients can recognize chronic glomerulonephritis from subclinical signs, typically higher than normal levels of protein and blood in urine.\nFrom there, timely treatment is performed to minimize the severity and slow down the progression of the disease.\nDetecting chronic glomerulonephritis is very important. Treatment of the disease in the early stages will be relatively easier and more controllable. Because at that time, the glomerular blood filtration index had not yet decreased much, and the disease symptoms had not yet affected the patient's health and quality of life.\nDoctors can predict the development of the disease to provide appropriate treatment regimens, while minimizing the possibility of dangerous complications for patients with chronic glomerulonephritis.",
