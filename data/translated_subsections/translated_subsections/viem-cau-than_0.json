    "subsection_content": "Glomerulonephritis is an inflammation that occurs in the  glomeruli including inflammation in the glomeruli and blood vessels within the kidney.(1)\nEach person normally has 2 kidneys. Each kidney weighs about 160 - 170 grams, and can eliminate 1 -2 liters of urine per day. Two healthy kidneys are capable of filtering 180 - 200 liters of waste and blood every 24 hours.\nThe structure of the kidney is made up of small blood vessels, including knots. The kidneys have the functions of filtering blood to create urine, excreting waste, regulating electrolytes, maintaining stable blood pressure, and blood circulation. participate in hematopoiesis. If the kidney is damaged, it causes symptoms such as edema, hypertension, anemia, hematuria, and changes in urine composition.\nThe disease can occur at any age with a variety of causes. Glomerulonephritis has two forms, acute and chronic, occurring due to many different causes. Therefore, diagnosing the disease is extremely important. If the disease is not treated promptly and properly, it will lead to serious health consequences for the patient, including death.\nAcute glomerulonephritis is an acute inflammation of the kidney. The disease often  appears after group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection due to skin infections or after sore throat. Is an immune complex disease that mostly recovers completely after 4-6 weeks.; Chronic glomerulonephritis is a chronic inflammatory condition in the glomeruli. The disease progresses over months and years, leading to atrophy of both kidneys. The disease progresses into acute episodes and eventually becomes irreversible chronic kidney failure.
