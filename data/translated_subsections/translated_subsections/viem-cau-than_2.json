    "subsection_content": "Glomerulonephritis is divided into two types: acute and chronic. Each form is caused by different causes, as well as having different symptoms.(3)\n1. Acute glomerulonephritis\nAcute glomerulonephritis occurs when a patient is infected with beta streptococcus due to a skin infection or after pharyngitis.\nThis is known as diffuse inflammation of the kidney units, but this inflammation does not include pyogenesis. Glomerulonephritis appears suddenly and unexpectedly due to infection or other diseases such as lupus, Goodpasture syndrome, polyarteritis nodosa, etc.\nAcute glomerulonephritis can go away on its own without treatment. Patients still need to be examined and treated early to prevent the possibility of kidney failure in the future.\n2. Chronic glomerulonephritis\nChronic glomerulonephritis has not yet clearly determined the cause of the disease. According to statistics from the National Kidney Foundation in the United States, people with family members suffering from glomerulonephritis or kidney-related diseases are at high risk of developing chronic glomerulonephritis.\nIn some cases, chronic glomerulonephritis is caused by long-term acute glomerulonephritis. The disease causes kidney fibrosis and is the main cause of chronic kidney failure.\nChronic glomerulonephritis is common in young men and people with hearing or vision loss. The disease cannot be completely cured, but patients can control and slow down the progression of the disease with a combination of treatment and appropriate nutrition.",
