    "subsection_content": "The causes of glomerulonephritis are very diverse. In cases of chronic type, the direct cause has not yet been determined.(4)\nCurrently, common causes of glomerulonephritis include infections, autoimmune diseases, vasculitis and sclerosis.\n1. Infection\nInfections can be a direct or indirect cause of glomerulonephritis. Potential infections with a high risk of glomerulonephritis include:\nPost-streptococcal glomerulonephritis: People with sore throat or other infections caused by streptococcus may develop glomerulonephritis after a week or two of recovery. The likelihood of getting the disease depends largely on each person's antibodies. Therefore, children are at higher risk of getting sick after having strep throat than adults.; Bacterial endocarditis: Bacterial endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. This causes changes in the patient's immune system. This is what causes glomerulonephritis; Viral kidney infection: People with diseases such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C may experience reverse infection. The virus that causes the disease will travel back from the liver to the kidneys and cause inflammation; HIV: The virus that causes HIV is also a cause of glomerulonephritis. The disease can even cause glomerulonephritis to progress faster than HIV.\n2. Autoimmune disease\nAutoimmune diseases are diseases caused by the immune system losing the ability to recognize and distinguish the body's antigens from external agents. Autoimmune diseases that can cause glomerulonephritis include:\nLupus erythematosus: Is a chronic disease that affects the skin, joints, kidneys, blood cells, heart and lungs; Goodpasture syndrome: This is a very rare disorder. This syndrome can cause damage to the kidneys, causing kidney-related diseases to progress rapidly and become untreatable; IgA nephropathy: Also known as berger disease, is the deposition of IgA immune complexes in the glomerulus. The disease has common symptoms such as hematuria that progresses slowly. IgA has the ability to impair kidney function and cause glomerulonephritis in patients.\n3. Vasculitis\nVasculitis is a change in the blood vessel wall due to damage to the blood vessel. Changes may include thickening, scarring, weakening or narrowing. Vasculitis limits blood flow, which can lead to organ and tissue damage.\nTypes of vasculitis that can cause glomerulonephritis include:\nPolyangiitis: This is a disease that causes damage to small and medium-sized blood vessels in parts of the body such as the kidneys, skin, muscles, joints and gastrointestinal tract; Granulomatosis with polyangiitis: Also known as Wegener's granulomatosis, the disease affects the blood vessels inside the patient's lungs, kidneys and respiratory tract.\n4. Sclerosis\nSclerosis, caused by scarring in the glomeruli, is also one of the causes of glomerulonephritis. Diseases that can cause scarring of the glomeruli include:\nHigh blood pressure: If not managed well, the disease will cause scarring and glomerulonephritis after a period of time; Diabetes: Scarring of the glomerulus is caused by excess sugar in the blood. Not only that, the disease also increases the speed of blood when spinning around the nephrons; Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis: In this disease, scarring will be scattered in several glomeruli\n5. Other causes\nThe possibility of glomerulonephritis can also come from Alport syndrome, which is a type of hereditary nephritis syndrome. Causes of Alport syndrome often run in families and the glomerulonephritis of people with Alport syndrome is mostly chronic glomerulonephritis.\nIn addition, people with poor eyesight and hearing, or cancer, are also at high risk of developing glomerulonephritis.\nSee also: Lupus Glomerulonephritis: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment",
