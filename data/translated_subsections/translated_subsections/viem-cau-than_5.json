    "subsection_content": "1. Effects of glomerulonephritis\nGlomerulonephritis will directly affect the ability to filter urine and waste in the body. Furthermore, the disease also inhibits the kidney's role in regulating blood pressure. When suffering from glomerulonephritis, the patient will be affected by the disease, related to the waste filtration process, including:\nAccumulation of waste or toxins in the blood; Poor ability to regulate minerals and nutrients; Lack or loss of red blood cells; Loss of protein in the blood\nAll of these effects will cause clinical symptoms for patients, reducing quality of life because of deterioration of health.\n2. Complications\nPeople with glomerulonephritis are at risk of complications of the disease, which are problems related to kidney health. This is an alarming note for people with glomerulonephritis because these complications are quite dangerous and can have a negative impact on the patient's health and life.\nFurthermore, kidney complications often have complex treatment regimens as well as long treatment times. Patients with glomerulonephritis are recommended to receive timely care and treatment according to doctor's instructions, combined with appropriate nutrition to minimize complications.\nComplications that can occur with glomerulonephritis include:\nAcute kidney failure: Causes a sudden and rapidly progressive decline in kidney function. People with kidney failure need to be treated promptly with an artificial blood purifier so that their lives are not affected; Chronic kidney disease: When inflammation or damage to the kidneys persists without treatment or recurs many times, it will reduce kidney function. This condition leads to chronic kidney disease. The patient will need dialysis or a kidney transplant to prevent the disease from progressing quickly and affecting life; High blood pressure: Damage to the glomerulus will inhibit the kidney's role in regulating blood pressure, thereby leading to high blood pressure; Nephrotic syndrome: Is a condition of excess protein in the urine (proteinuria > 3.5g/day). This continuous excretion of protein through urine will lead to a decrease in blood protein < 60g/l, and albumin < 30g/l. Nephrotic syndrome can cause blood clots to form in the kidney blood vessels",
