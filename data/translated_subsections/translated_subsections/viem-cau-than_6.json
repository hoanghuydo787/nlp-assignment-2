    "subsection_content": "Glomerulonephritis is often diagnosed through blood and urine test results. Most symptoms are unclear or confused with other common physiological phenomena. Patients often discover the disease when they go to see a doctor for another disease.\n1. Urine test\nPeople with glomerulonephritis will have high levels of protein in their urine, and in some cases blood in the urine. Urine test results will show:\nCreatinine clearance (waste filtered by the kidneys); Amount of protein in urine; Urine concentration; Red blood cells in urine\n2. Blood test\nA blood test is a diagnostic method in which the doctor will look at the level of creatinine in a patient's blood sample.\nBlood test results will show:\nLevel of red blood cells in the blood; Albumin level; Level of urine nitrogen in the blood; Creatinine level in the blood\n3. Kidney biopsy\nKidney biopsy is a method in which the doctor takes a piece of patient's kidney tissue and examines it for signs of infection under a microscope. To perform a percutaneous kidney biopsy, the doctor will insert a long needle into the back, where the kidney is located, to remove a piece of tissue.\nDoctors will prescribe a kidney biopsy for subjects with abnormal indicators in urine or blood.",
