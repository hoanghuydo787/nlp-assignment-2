    "subsection_content": "Atopic dermatitis is a chronic disease that cannot be completely cured, but it can still be controlled. Current treatments only aim to restore the skin to a normal condition for as long as possible, preventing and treating flare-ups/complications. With the motto that prevention is better than cure, atopic dermatitis is treated with the following strategies:\nHealing phase\nUsing anti-itch cream: This is a measure to help patients reduce the itchy feeling and avoid scratching too much, causing skin damage. Patients are prescribed to use topical cream to prevent itching. In case they still feel itchy, many patients need to take antihistamines to prevent allergies.; Protect your skin with moisturizer: When you have atopic dermatitis, your skin is often dry, use moisturizer to soften the skin 2-3 times a day, avoid cracking and causing infection.; Apply anti-inflammatory cream: If your skin is inflamed, red, or itchy, use anti-inflammatory cream to apply. When the skin has reduced redness and itching, limit the use of anti-inflammatory creams and increase moisturizing care with moisturizers. If you overuse anti-inflammatory drugs, your skin color will change, your skin will thin, your skin will grow, and your risk of infection will be higher. You should use anti-inflammatory cream as prescribed by your doctor.; Antibiotic treatment if the skin is infected: Only add antibiotics for a short time. If the wound is open or oozing fluid, it is necessary to cover it with gauze and clean it and change the bandage every day to avoid superinfection.; Cold compresses can be applied to reduce inflammation and itching in the skin.; Avoid pressure and stress when working, need adequate rest and sleep, and exercise regularly.; Build a healthy, nutritious diet and strengthen the immune system.\nPrevention phase\nContinue to protect your skin with moisturizer; Use cosmetics for sensitive skin; Continue a healthy diet and exercise regimen\nDuring the treatment of atopic dermatitis, patients need to limit the following factors that trigger the disease:\nAvoid eating allergenic foods, keep the house clean, regularly wash blankets, mattresses, carpets, curtains, avoid cigarette smoke and dusty, polluted environments.; Do not bathe for more than 20 minutes at a time, preferably with warm water rather than hot water.; You should always use one type of soap, perfume, shampoo, and gentle detergent. If you want to try a new detergent or shampoo, you should test it on a thin area of ​​skin to see if it causes irritation; Minimize scratching and cut your nails to avoid scratching too hard, causing skin damage. Children should wear gloves at night.; You should wear cool, soft, thin clothes in hot weather. Drink enough water every day.\nPeople with atopic dermatitis should protect their hands with moisturizer",
