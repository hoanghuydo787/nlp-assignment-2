    "subsection_content": "Acute gastritis comes from many different causes, typically including:\n1. Microbial infection\nThe invasion and growth of Helicobacter Pylori bacteria is one of the common causes of acute gastritis, specifically accounting for ⅔ of the world's population. In addition, other types of bacteria, viruses, fungi... are also agents but do not account for a high proportion.\n2. React against irritants\nBile reflux: Bile is naturally excreted into the small intestine to support digestion. If accidentally moved to the stomach, it will cause mucosal damage.; Alcohol consumption: Alcoholic beverages damage the stomach lining, leading to inflammation; Abuse of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Pain relievers, such as Aspirin, Ibuprofen... can increase acid levels in the stomach by inhibiting protective substances called Prostaglandins. Frequent abuse and high doses will lead to inflammation.; Iron: Iron has the potential to damage the stomach lining if taken on an empty stomach.\n3. Immune system disorders\nThis is a malfunction of the immune system, affecting the stomach lining cells. In the long term, this reaction will cause the stomach's protective barrier to be eroded. Accordingly, acute gastritis due to immune system disorders often occurs commonly in people with type 1 diabetes, Hashimoto's disease, Vitamin B12 deficiency...\n4. Blood vessel problems\nRare malformations of blood vessels or complications from chronic heart failure can also affect blood flow to the stomach. In some cases, this is the cause of acute gastritis.\n5. Ischemia\nWhen the blood supply to the stomach is insufficient, inflammation can occur. Some common causes include:\nCocaine drug abuse.; Severe dehydration.; Sepsis.; Severe injury or burns.\n6. Food allergies or poisoning\nFood allergies in the stomach will cause white blood cell counts to increase, causing irritation and mucosal damage. This is also one of the common causes of acute gastritis.(2)\n7. Granulomatous disease\nAcute gastritis can be a complication of granulomatous disease. This medical condition affects the body's immune system, damaging the stomach.",
