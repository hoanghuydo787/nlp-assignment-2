    "subsection_content": "Gastritis is an inflammation of the gastric mucosa, characterized by the infiltration of inflammatory cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, etc. This is a common lesion in all subjects. At any age, the majority of patients with duodenal gastritis have no symptoms but mainly have symptoms due to acute inflammation. Possible symptoms: pain in the epigastric area when hungry or after eating, feeling full quickly, and discomfort in the epigastric area after eating.\nIn addition, gastroduodenal inflammation is also recognized through other symptoms such as epigastric burning, belching, heartburn and bloating.(1)\n1. Acute gastroduodenal inflammation\nGastroduodenal inflammation is diagnosed as acute gastroduodenal inflammation when the stomach mucosa is exposed to toxins, leading to congestive and hemorrhagic lesions on the mucosal wall. These harmful toxins often appear in non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, alcohol, bile acids, etc.\nBesides, acute gastroduodenal inflammation can also come from reduced blood perfusion in the stomach. The condition occurs in subjects with trauma, burns, hypothermia, sepsis, or people undergoing radiation therapy for cancer and systemic chemotherapy.\nPeople with acute gastroduodenal inflammation will usually develop symptoms quickly with a rapid progression. This is also the level at which the disease can be completely treated with medication.(2)\n2. Chronic duodenal gastritis\nChronic gastritis is the result of long-term inflammation. Chronic gastric mucosal lesions can be diffuse or localized in one area of ​​the gastric mucosa. There are 3 types of chronic gastroduodenal inflammation:\nAtrophic gastric mucosa type B: is a common type, caused by Helicobacter Pylori bacteria, the initial atrophic inflammation in the antrum gradually spreads to the upper part of the stomach. Most bacterial atrophic mucosal thickening caused by H.P. is often silent and has no symptoms; Atrophic gastric mucosa type B: is a common type, caused by Helicobacter Pylori bacteria, the initial atrophic inflammation in the antrum gradually spreads to the upper part of the stomach. Most bacterial atrophic mucosal inflammation caused by H.P is often silent and has no symptoms.\nAtrophic gastric mucosa type A: less common, autoimmune cause, the body produces antibodies against its own gastric mucosa, atrophic inflammatory lesions spread from the gastric corpus bulge down in the opposite direction of atrophic gastritis gastric mucosa type B.; Atrophic gastric mucosa type A: less common, autoimmune cause, the body produces antibodies against its own gastric mucosa, atrophic inflammatory lesions spread from the gastric corpus bulge down in the opposite direction of atrophic gastritis type B gastric mucosa.\nSpecial forms of gastroduodenal inflammation: Chemical (bile, anti-inflammatory steroids), lymphocytic gastritis, erosive gastritis, eosinophilic gastritis, infectious gastritis ( Bacteria, viruses, parasites), gastritis due to Crohn's disease...; Special forms of gastroduodenal inflammation: Chemical (bile, anti-inflammatory steroids), lymphocytic gastritis, erosive gastritis, eosinophilic gastritis, infectious gastritis ( Bacteria, viruses, parasites), gastritis due to Crohn's disease....",
