    "subsection_content": "1. Helicobacter Pylori infection\nHelicobacter Pylori infection is considered the leading cause of chronic atrophic gastritis. Helicobacter Pylori (H.P), is a type of bacillus that can live in the acidic environment of the stomach, causing long-term inflammation of the gastric mucosa leading to atrophy of the mucosal glands.\nAccording to statistics, 60% - 80% of Vietnamese people are infected with H.P. bacteria. This bacteria can enter humans through contaminated water or food. Besides, people living in unhygienic environments also have a high risk of being infected with HP bacteria and suffering from inflammation of the stomach lining. (3)\n2. Eating habits\nEating habits are one of the leading factors that directly affect the health of the digestive system. Because of its close connection with the digestive process, frequency of contractions and acid secretion of the stomach, unscientific eating habits will increase your risk of duodenal gastritis. Eating a lot of spices can strongly irritate the stomach lining.\nActivities such as skipping breakfast, not eating at the right time or having a specific time can increase the risk of gastroduodenal inflammation or recurrence of the disease more than others.\n2. Unhealthy lifestyle\nUnhealthy lifestyle negatively impacts many aspects of a patient's health. This is not the direct cause of gastroduodenal inflammation, but the integrated consequences of unhealthy lifestyle activities will lead to gastroduodenal inflammation.\nAlcohol abuse: Alcohol or alcoholic drinks have the ability to increase acid secretion in the stomach, causing direct damage to the stomach lining.",
