    "subsection_content": "Gastritis, also known as inflammation of the gastric mucosa, is a typical digestive health disease. The disease is a condition in which the mucosal surface is damaged or eroded by bacteria or other agents. Gastritis is characterized by the infiltration of inflammatory cells, so doctors need the results of gastric histopathology tests to diagnose and conclude the disease.\nThe gastric mucosa is a thin layer that functions to protect the stomach wall from the irritating effects of acid or bacterial attacks. According to the pathogenesis of gastritis, when the gastric mucosa is attacked by bacteria from the outside, the gastric mucosa will be damaged, with a high possibility of developing gastric ulcers. In addition, the mucosa can also be damaged by abnormal acid secretion inside the body. This is a consequence of irregular eating habits and a prolonged unhealthy diet.(1)\nThe disease has two types: acute gastritis and chronic gastritis, often accompanied by clinical symptoms of the intestines, digestive system and abnormal stomach.\n1. Acute gastritis\nAcute gastritis is an acute inflammation of the stomach due to many reasons: drugs, alcohol, etc. Patients will often recognize acute gastritis as soon as symptoms appear.\nThe main symptoms are epigastric pain, causing discomfort during eating activities. These are typical clinical symptoms of the disease and will go away on their own after a short time, ranging from 5 to 7 days.\nPeople with acute gastritis may not need treatment, they just need to change their diet to minimize and support the stomach to recover from damage.\n2. Chronic gastritis\nChronic gastritis occurs mostly due to HP bacteria. It is unclear when the disease started. The disease often has no symptoms, mainly detected during stomach endoscopy. Chronic gastritis can progress to atrophic inflammation, intestinal metaplasia, and develop precancerous lesions of the stomach as well as increase the risk of stomach cancer for the patient.",
