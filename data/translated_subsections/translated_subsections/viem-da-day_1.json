You can completely prevent acute gastritis by following a scientific diet and healthy lifestyle.(2)\nOn the other hand, gastritis can also easily appear in certain subjects. These subjects include people living in unsanitary environments, thereby increasing the possibility of being infected with H.pylori bacteria, a type of bacteria that causes gastritis.\nIn addition, older people are also considered to be at higher risk of gastritis than young people because of long-term HP infection. Furthermore, older people are also a group of people who use a lot of anti-inflammatory pain relievers (NSAIDS). This is also the reason why the mucosa in the elderly is at high risk of damage due to long-term use of NSAIDs.",
