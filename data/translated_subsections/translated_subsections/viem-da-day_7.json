However, for people with gastritis caused by H.pylori bacterial infection, infection is possible.\nIt should be noted that the infection here is infection with H.pylori bacteria through food and drink. This is the most common type of bacteria that causes gastritis, so when this bacteria is transmitted from person to person, it can easily cause gastritis.\n2. Is gastritis dangerous?\nAcute gastritis is not a dangerous disease. On the other hand, gastritis can be completely treated medically by taking it orally. However, it can cause gastrointestinal bleeding: vomiting blood, black stools, anemia...\nChronic gastritis is also a cause of atrophy of the gastric mucosa leading to intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and, most seriously, stomach cancer.",
