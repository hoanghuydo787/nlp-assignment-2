    "subsection_content": "Based on disease characteristics, atopic dermatitis can be classified into the following groups:\n1. Allergic contact dermatitis\nOccurs due to the immune system's reaction when the skin comes into contact with environmental allergens such as metals, chemicals, cosmetics, insect bites, etc. The disease usually subsides and completely disappears after 1 month. -4 weeks.\n2. Seasonal allergic dermatitis\nRelated to weather changes. Therefore, the disease often develops strongly at the time of changing seasons or in winter when the air becomes cold and dry.\n3. Superinfected allergic contact dermatitis\nIt is a severe form of atopic dermatitis when broken blisters open the door for germs to enter the body, causing the skin to swell, itch, become red, and cause severe pain. If not treated properly, the disease can recur many times and cause dangerous complications such as blood infection, skin necrosis, etc.\n4. Atopic dermatitis\nThis type of dermatitis is common in people with allergic genes or allergic conditions. Atopic dermatitis is difficult to completely control (due to the interaction between atopic genes and the surrounding environment) and is also easy to relapse.",
