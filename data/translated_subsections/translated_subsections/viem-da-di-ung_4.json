    "subsection_content": "The cause of atopic dermatitis stems from the complex interactions between environmental factors, the immune system and genetics.\nIn particular, the immune system is overactive when the skin comes into contact with external irritants, which is a common reason for allergic dermatitis. Some familiar irritants include:\nDetergents, soaps, cosmetics,...; The weather is dry, cold, and humid; Dust, mold, animal hair, pollen, sweat,...; Foods such as cow's milk, eggs, wheat or peanuts; Wool or synthetic fibers; Hormonal changes during pregnancy or menstruation; Stress and anxiety; Skin infections\nIn addition, when parents have allergic diseases (atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, asthma), when giving birth, the baby is also at a higher risk than normal of developing atopic dermatitis. The reason is that atopic dermatitis is related to allergic genes, especially genes related to skin structure. When this gene is defective, it affects the skin's protective function (moisturizing function, prevents water drainage, regulates body temperature and protects the body from bacteria) - makes the skin sick and affects other organs in the body.",
