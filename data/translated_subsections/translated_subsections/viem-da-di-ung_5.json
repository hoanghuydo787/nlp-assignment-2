The incidence rate in adults ranges from 2-5%, while in children it is up to 10-20%.\nIn infants, atopic dermatitis often has initial symptoms such as eczema or strabismus - appearing mainly on the face, skin folds in the armpits and groin; Can spread to the skin of the trunk and limbs. The illness usually starts from 6 to 12 weeks of age and gradually improves when the child is 18 months old. In older children, dermatitis changes in parts such as wrists, elbows, knees, and ankles. The skin around the mouth is also at risk of inflammation due to the impact of food and saliva. If your child frequently scratches itchy skin, it will easily cause the damaged skin to become fibrotic (thicker, drier skin).\nFor adults, people whose parents or family members have atopic dermatitis or people with dry, sensitive skin are at high risk. Areas of atopic dermatitis in adults are often concentrated on the hands or feet.\nChildren are susceptible to atopic dermatitis",
