    "subsection_content": "Each type of sinusitis can be caused by different causes. Therefore, classifying sinusitis can help find the cause of the disease.\n1. Causes of acute sinusitis\nAcute polysinusitis requires identifying the infectious agent to use appropriate antibiotics to avoid antibiotic resistance. Acute polysinusitis is mostly caused by viral agents, commonly viruses such as rhinovirus (virus that causes colds), influenza, parainfluenza (virus that causes upper respiratory tract infections). A small percentage of polysinusitis is caused by a bacterial infection or develops a secondary bacterial infection. Bacteria that often cause acute polysinusitis include pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, staphylococcus or anaerobic bacteria when the infection originates from the oral area.\nAcute fungal sinusitis often occurs in patients with weakened immune systems, such as diabetes, HIV, cancer, etc. (1)\n2. Causes of chronic sinusitis\nAccording to MSc.BSc.CKI Ho Van Huu, chronic polysinusitis is often caused by many combined pathogenesis factors. Patients may have co-morbidities or related risk factors such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, smoking, air pollution, structural abnormalities in the nasal sinuses, and systemic diseases affecting to the function of cilia in the nasal and sinus mucosa and oral infections.",
