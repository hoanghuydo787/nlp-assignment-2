Exploit symptoms\nPatients present with nasal congestion, anterior or posterior rhinorrhea, facial headache, and reduced or loss of sense of smell. In children, it often presents with cough rather than olfactory discomfort. When the patient exhibits at least 2/4 of the above symptoms and has symptoms of nasal congestion or runny nose, the diagnosis is sinusitis.\nWhen acute polysinusitis occurs, clinical symptoms are often severe, and there may be accompanying systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, loss of appetite, fatigue...\nThe location of the patient's facial headache will suggest that the sinuses are inflamed:\nMaxillary sinusitis: patients often have pain in the cheek area. If accompanied by toothache, attention should be paid to maxillary sinusitis secondary to tooth root infection.; Frontal sinusitis: often pain in the frontal area; Sphenoid sinusitis: often pain in the occipital area behind the head and neck; Ethmoid sinusitis: usually the ethmoid sinus is located deep in the skull cavity, stretching from front to back, so pain symptoms are often vague\n2. Sinus endoscopy\nAcute polysinusitis often shows nasal mucosa congestion, edema, and mucus clouding the sinus openings. Meanwhile, chronic polysinusitis often shows mucosal swelling, degeneration, and possibly nasal polyps.\nSinus endoscopy is a routine test in the diagnosis of polysinusitis\n3. Diagnostic imaging\nThis is a diagnostic tool to help determine whether or not polysinusitis is present. Patients will be scanned with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the maxillofacial area.",
