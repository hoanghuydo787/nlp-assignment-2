    "subsection_content": "MSc.BSc.CKI Ho Van Huu said that treatment methods for polysinusitis include medical treatment using medicine or surgery.\n1. Use medicine to treat polysinusitis\nMost acute polysinusitis will respond to medical treatment, including antibiotics, systemic or local anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-allergic drugs, and symptom-relieving drugs. Patients are often advised to drink plenty of water to thin mucus and use a nasal spray to aid in treatment, avoiding exposure to allergic or irritant factors: cold air, cigarette smoke, air. polluted…\n2. Surgery\nSurgery is indicated when polysinusitis has complications or chronic sinusitis does not respond to drug treatment. Surgery removes lesions and abnormal nasal structures that cause obstruction such as deviated septum and turbinate hypertrophy.\nSinus surgery at Tam Anh General Hospital is performed through nasal endoscopy using a German Karl Storz machine along with an American Medtronic cutting machine system. The surgeon will insert tiny endoscopic instruments into the patient's nose, then widen the sinus openings, cut polyps, remove fungal tissue, and remove mucus and pus, without causing damage to neighboring organs.\nWhen the surgery is over, the doctor can place sponges on both sides of the nose to help stabilize the incision and stop bleeding in place. The patient will be taken to the recovery room until he regains consciousness. When the patient is awake, he can breathe through his mouth and eat normally. The next day, take out the sponge and breathe through both noses. Usually patients are discharged after 2-3 days.\nPolysinusitis surgery is minimally invasive, recovers quickly, and minimizes the risk of complications during and after surgery at Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City.",
