    "subsection_content": "Colitis is an inflammation of the colon lining. Colitis can be caused by infection, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), anemia, allergic reactions, or microscopic colitis. Chronic colitis is often a lifelong condition and there is currently no cure, only treatment options to help control the condition.\nColitis is divided into the following types:\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD): A chronic or relapsing inflammatory disease of the digestive tract including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a diffuse, non-specific inflammatory condition that causes damage of unknown origin continuously from the rectum to the colon, causing erosive inflammation and mucosal ulcers. Crohn's disease: is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause, characterized by inflammation or fistula of all layers of the gastrointestinal tract and discontinuously distributed lesions.; Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): A chronic or relapsing inflammatory disease of the digestive tract including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease.

Crohn's disease: is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause, characterized by inflammation or fistula of all layers of the gastrointestinal tract and discontinuously distributed lesions.\nPseudomembranous colitis (PC): Pseudomembranous colitis (PC) occurs due to overgrowth of the Clostridium difficile bacteria. This type of bacteria normally lives in the intestines but does not cause any problems because it is balanced by the presence of beneficial bacteria. Some drugs, especially antibiotics, can destroy beneficial bacteria causing intestinal dysbiosis leading to excessive proliferation of C.difficile causing pseudomembranous colitis; Pseudomembranous colitis (PC): Pseudomembranous colitis (PC) occurs due to overgrowth of the Clostridium difficile bacteria.

Blood clots are one of the common reasons for sudden blockage. Diseases and factors that increase the risk of anemic colitis include: Vasculitis; diabetes; colon cancer; dehydration; bleed; heart failure; injury; side effects of medications, abdominal surgery or large arteries such as the aorta.; Ischemic colitis (IC): Ischemic colitis (IC) occurs when blood flow to the colon is suddenly cut off or restricted.

During colorectal endoscopy, the results were all within normal limits, colon damage was only determined based on histological results. Microscopic colitis is classified into two forms: lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis. Risk factors for microscopic colitis include: smoking, autoimmune diseases, people over 50 years old, female gender...

This condition can cause symptoms in infants such as reflux, vomiting, fussiness, and possibly blood in the stool. Although doctors do not know the exact cause of allergic colitis, many studies indicate that it may be due to infants having an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to certain ingredients in breast milk.
