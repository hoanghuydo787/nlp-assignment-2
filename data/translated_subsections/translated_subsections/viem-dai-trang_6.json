Then the doctor can have the patient perform necessary tests for diagnosis such as:\nBlood tests: Blood tests can help your doctor check for anemia, infection, or other immunological causes; Stool sample test: Red blood cells, white blood cells or parasites in the stool can help diagnose the cause of colitis more accurately.; Colonoscopy: This method allows the doctor to view the entire colon using a thin, flexible, lighted tube with a camera at the end. During the endoscopy, the doctor may also take small tissue samples (biopsy) to confirm a more accurate diagnosis.; Sigmoidoscopy: The doctor uses a thin, flexible, lighted endoscope to examine the rectum and sigmoid colon – the lower part of the colon.; X-ray: If the patient has severe symptoms, the doctor may take a standard abdominal X-ray to rule out serious complications, such as colon perforation or intestinal obstruction; CT scan: A CT scan of the abdomen or pelvis may be done if your doctor suspects complications from colitis. A CT scan can also reveal the extent of inflammation of the colon.; Computed tomography (CT) of the small intestine and magnetic resonance (MR) of the intestine: Your doctor may recommend one of these noninvasive tests if they want to rule out any inflammation in the small intestine. These tests are more sensitive for identifying damage and complications in the small intestine than conventional imaging tests.\nA CT scan can also reveal the extent of inflammation of the colon",
