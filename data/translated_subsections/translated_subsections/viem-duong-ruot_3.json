Testing\nTests to evaluate anemia or infection: The purpose is to check for anemia (lack of red blood cells, causing reduced oxygen transport to tissues) or signs of bacterial or viral infection.; Test to evaluate for anemia or infection: The purpose is to check for anemia (lack of red blood cells, causing reduced oxygen transport to tissues) or signs of bacterial or viral infection.\nStool test: The doctor conducts a stool sample analysis test to detect hidden blood and parasites; Stool test: The doctor conducts a stool sample analysis test to detect hidden blood and parasites.\n2. Endoscopy\nColonoscopy: The doctor uses a small endoscope with a camera attached to look inside the entire colon. During this process, small tissue samples may also be removed for laboratory analysis.; Colonoscopy: The doctor uses a small endoscope with a camera attached to look inside the entire colon. During this process, small tissue samples may also be removed for laboratory analysis.\nSigmoidoscopy: The doctor uses a small scope to examine the rectum and sigmoid colon. If the colon is severely inflamed, the patient may be prescribed this test instead of a full colonoscopy.; Sigmoidoscopy: The doctor uses a small scope to examine the rectum and sigmoid colon. If the colon is severely inflamed, the patient may be prescribed this test instead of a full colonoscopy.\nCapsule endoscopy: The patient swallows a capsule containing a camera inside. Accordingly, the detailed images collected will be sent to the camera worn on the belt. After completing this process, the capsule also automatically leaves the body through the feces.; Capsule endoscopy: The patient swallows a capsule containing a camera inside.

After completing this process, the capsule also automatically leaves the body through feces.\nBalloon-assisted small enteroscopy: This test allows a deeper look inside the small intestine – a location that a standard endoscope cannot reach.; Balloon-assisted small bowel endoscopy: This test allows a deeper look inside the small intestine – a location that a standard endoscope cannot reach.\nUpper digestive endoscopy: the doctor uses an endoscope to examine the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. These areas are rarely damaged in Crohn's disease, so this test is usually performed only when the patient has symptoms of nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, or upper abdominal pain.; Upper digestive endoscopy: the doctor uses an endoscope to examine the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.

Imaging diagnosis\nX-ray: If the patient has severe symptoms, the doctor may order an abdominal X-ray to check for colon enlargement or colon perforation.; X-ray: If the patient has severe symptoms, the doctor may order an abdominal X-ray to check for colon enlargement or colon perforation.\nComputed tomography (CT): Computed tomography (CT) helps obtain detailed images of the entire intestine as well as tissues outside the intestine.; Computed tomography (CT): Computed tomography (CT) helps obtain detailed images of the entire intestine as well as tissues outside the intestine.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI scanners use magnetic fields to create detailed images of tissues and organs, thereby helping to detect fistulas around the anus or small intestine.; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI scanners use magnetic fields to create detailed images of tissues and organs, thereby helping to detect fistulas around the anus or small intestine.\nImaging tests may be ordered in the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease",
