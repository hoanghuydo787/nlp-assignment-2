    "subsection_content": "Postpartum urinary tract infection is a condition that usually occurs within a few days or weeks after giving birth. Due to the characteristics of the birth process, women who give birth by cesarean section are more at risk of urinary tract infections than women who give birth vaginally (normal birth).\nUrinary Tract Infection (UTI) is a condition in which parts of the urinary system (including the kidneys, ureters, and bladder) are attacked by bacteria, most typically E.Coli bacteria.\nUsually, UTIs will appear in the lower urinary tract (bladder, urethra). Bacteria can then follow the urethra and enter the kidneys, causing acute or chronic nephritis. In particular, due to the short structure of the urethra, women have a higher risk of urinary tract infections than men. (first)",
