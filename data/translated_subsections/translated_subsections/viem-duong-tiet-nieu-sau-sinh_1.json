    "subsection_content": "According to Urology experts, Tam Anh General Hospital, many women suffer from urinary tract infections and the cause of this condition is due to:\nDuring labor, the pelvic floor muscles, ligaments, nerves, and lower abdominal muscles become overactive, leading to injuries that cause them to lose function. At this time, urine is easily lost, creating conditions for bacteria to multiply and enter the urinary tract, causing infection; Pregnancy and childbirth can also cause the bladder to lose its tone, causing fluid retention. This is an opportunity for urine to easily reflux into the ureters, remaining in this area for a long time, creating conditions for bacteria to multiply, increasing the risk of urinary tract infections during pregnancy.; The pressure of a baby being born vaginally can impact the bladder, leading to temporary paralysis. In case you have a cesarean section and have to undergo anesthesia, it reduces the flexibility of the bladder. In addition, swelling and pain in the perineum also affect the excretory function and make pregnant women susceptible to urinary tract infections.; If you have a catheter inserted during childbirth, rubbing or scratching the skin can easily cause infection because the area is often exposed to urine and bacteria from the anus.; Besides, psychological factors such as fear of pain or abstinence can prevent you from bathing and cleaning your private area regularly, causing bacteria to grow quickly.",
