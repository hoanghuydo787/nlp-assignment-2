    "subsection_content": "Simple urinary tract infections, which occur in young women and do not have urinary tract abnormalities, mostly do not cause complications. On the contrary, complicated urinary infections in patients with pre-existing favorable factors can lead to many serious complications, even life-threatening if not treated promptly.\nThe risks and complications of urinary tract infection are many, such as bacterial virulence causing destruction of kidney tissue, renal papillary necrosis, causing obstruction or impaired kidney function. This condition, if left for a long time, can lead to permanent kidney failure or require kidney removal.\nUrinary system infections in men can cause prostate abscess, orchitis, epididymitis, blockage of the vas deferens, and increased risk of infertility.\nIf the persistent presence of bacteria in the urinary system is not treated promptly and with a sufficient dose of antibiotics, the bacteria will easily move into the blood, causing sepsis, septic shock, and death.",
