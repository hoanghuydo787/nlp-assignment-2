If the patient only has localized symptoms in the lower urinary tract due to cystitis or urethritis, the doctor will prescribe oral antibiotics for 5-7 days. If there are symptoms of fever and chills, sepsis, or inflammation in the upper urinary tract, the patient needs to be hospitalized to use intravenous antibiotics.\nIn case the disease recurs many times, the patient has a urinary tract malformation or is having a urinary tube inserted, the doctor will culture the bacteria to find the right antibiotic that is sensitive to that strain of bacteria.\nIn addition, drugs with antiseptic properties on the urinary system are also noted for their effectiveness in killing bacteria and can be prescribed for use with antibiotics. However, the evidence for these drugs remains unclear.\nIf the infection cannot be controlled with medication or there are complications in the kidneys such as septic hydronephrosis, pus in the kidney, or kidney abscess, the patient needs to undergo surgical treatment to easily drain the infection. Similar to urinary system defects, without complete surgical correction, patients may face the risk of the disease recurring over time, leading to dangerous complications.",
