    "subsection_content": "Unhygienic eating is one of the main causes of hepatitis A\nThe cause of hepatitis A is the hepatitis A virus entering liver cells and causing inflammation. This disease is closely related to personal hygiene, food hygiene and environmental hygiene. According to Dr. Trung, the virus that causes the disease can live for months in a polluted environment, therefore, areas with poor sanitation and hygiene practices have a very high rate of people infected with hepatitis A virus.\nPath of transmission of hepatitis A virus\nThe main way of spread of hepatitis A virus is through the gastrointestinal tract (fecal-oral route), that is, eating food or drinking water containing the virus. Besides, this virus can also be transmitted through close contact (oral-anal sex) with an infected person. Specifically, some cases that can spread the virus are as follows:\nEating unsanitary food, the person preparing it is infected with hepatitis A virus or not following proper hand washing procedures before touching food; Eating raw shellfish (shrimp, crab, oysters, snails...) from polluted water sources; Using water contaminated with hepatitis A virus; Eating together, sharing personal items (eating utensils, towels, toothbrushes...) with people with hepatitis A; Having sex with someone infected with the virus.\nIn addition, the virus can also be transmitted through blood, but the possibility of spreading this way is very low because very little hepatitis A virus exists in the patient's blood.",
