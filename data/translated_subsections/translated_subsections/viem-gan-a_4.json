    "subsection_content": "In rare cases, hepatitis A can lead to acute liver failure\nUnlike other types of viral hepatitis, hepatitis A does not cause long-term liver damage and does not develop into chronic hepatitis. In most cases, patients will recover completely after 1-2 months of treatment. The virus that causes the disease also does not remain in the body after recovery. However, if the patient is old or has other health problems such as diabetes, anemia, congestive heart failure, etc., the disease may get worse, prolonging treatment time.\nIn rare cases, hepatitis A can lead to acute liver failure. This complication is most common in older adults and people with pre-existing chronic liver disease. Patients with acute liver failure need to be hospitalized immediately for monitoring and treatment. Some people with acute liver failure may need a liver transplant.",
