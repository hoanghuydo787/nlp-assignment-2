    "subsection_content": "To diagnose hepatitis A, the doctor will first ask about the symptoms the patient is experiencing, as well as review personal medical history. After that, the doctor may prescribe the patient a blood test to detect HAV-specific antibodies in the blood.\nWhen infected with hepatitis A virus, the patient's body will create antibodies against this virus, called anti-HAV (including 2 types: IgM and IgG). Testing these antibodies helps doctors determine HAV virus infection. (first)\n1. IgM antibody (Anti HAV-IgM)\nIf the test result is positive (IgM antibodies are present in the plasma), the patient may be infected or recently infected with hepatitis A virus. IgM antibodies appear early after the patient has the first clinical symptoms and peak 60 - 90 days after infection. After 3 - 12 months of infection, this antibody will disappear.\n2. IgG antibody (Anti HAV-IgG)\nIf IgG antibodies are present in the blood, the patient may have recently been infected with hepatitis A virus or had been infected many years ago. After IgM antibodies disappear, IgG antibodies will appear and remain permanently in the blood to protect the body against HAV virus attacks.\nThe results of these tests also show whether the person tested has ever been vaccinated against hepatitis A. If the patient has been vaccinated with this vaccine and tests positive for anti-HAV antibodies, the vaccine is effective.\nIn addition to testing for hepatitis A, the doctor may prescribe the patient to check blood bilirubin levels and liver enzyme levels to determine the level of damage and provide appropriate treatment.",
