    "subsection_content": "Hepatitis C is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The disease causes liver cells to become inflamed, causing liver dysfunction. Over time, inflammation in liver tissue can form permanent fibrotic lesions, leading to many dangerous complications such as cirrhosis and liver cancer.\nHepatitis C can be acute or chronic:\nAcute hepatitis C is a short-term infection that lasts for 6 months after the virus enters the body. About 15 - 25% of cases of virus C infection heal completely on their own, without needing any specific treatment. However, most cases of acute hepatitis lead to chronic disease.; Chronic hepatitis C is an infection that lasts more than 6 months. If left untreated, the disease can be lifelong and cause serious health problems, including liver failure, cirrhosis, liver cancer and even death. According to estimates by the World Health Organization, globally there are currently about 71 million people chronically infected with hepatitis C virus.(1)",
