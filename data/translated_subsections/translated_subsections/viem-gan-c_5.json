    "subsection_content": "Hepatitis C can cause many serious complications, including:\nChronic hepatitis: manifested by symptoms of mild to severe liver dysfunction. However, most cases have few obvious symptoms; Cirrhosis: Prolonged hepatitis causes liver damage. Damaged tissue is continuously replaced by scar tissue, causing the liver to gradually become fibrotic. According to WHO, about 15 - 30% of people with chronic hepatitis progress to cirrhosis within 20 years. Symptoms of cirrhosis depend on the stage of compensation or decompensation of liver cell function and increased hepatic portal vein pressure. Some common serious symptoms include vomiting blood, bleeding that is difficult to control, abdominal infection, coma, and eventually death due to these complications.; Liver cancer: Hepatitis C virus is identified as one of the causes of liver cancer. People with HCV-related cirrhosis have a higher risk of liver cancer than people with cirrhosis related to heavy drinking. The risk of cancer will be even higher if the patient has both hepatitis C and alcoholism.",
