First, the doctor will prescribe the patient to undergo a test to check for the presence of anti-HCV antibodies. Anti-HCV antibodies are substances the body makes to fight the hepatitis C virus, usually appearing about 12 weeks after infection.\nIf the anti-HCV antibody test result is positive, the patient is highly likely to be infected with the virus. The doctor may prescribe the patient to continue performing a number of other tests to confirm the diagnosis, including:\nHCV - RNA test (HCV load measurement): measures the amount of viral RNA present in the patient's blood; Genotyping test: To find out which type of hepatitis C virus is causing the disease, because there are currently 6 main genotypes of HCV. This information will help determine which treatment will be most effective for the patient.\nIf tests show that the patient has chronic hepatitis C or shows signs of liver damage, the doctor may prescribe the patient to perform tests to check liver activity, such as liver function tests, imaging tests, and liver function tests. Liver imaging through abdominal ultrasound, liver cirrhosis through elastography or CT scan or liver magnetic resonance to detect liver tumors, blood tests for early screening of hepatocellular cancer (HCC Risk)...\nHepatitis C treatment methods\nHepatitis C infection is treated with antiviral medications. The choice of medication and duration of treatment depends on HCV genotype, existing liver lesions, other medical conditions (if any), and previous treatments.\nCurrently, hepatitis C treatment regimens mainly use direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) such as Sofosbuvir, Ledipasvir, Daclatasvir, Elbasvir, Grazoprevir, Velpatasvir... which have the effect of completely eliminating hepatitis C virus. out of the body, while preventing liver damage.\nThe average treatment time with a regimen using DAAs is 12 weeks, in some cases it needs to be longer, up to 24 weeks. The use of DAAs can be combined or not with Ribavirin, depending on the specific case. If you have developed serious complications from chronic hepatitis C infection, your doctor may discuss liver transplantation with you and your family. Liver transplant is surgery to replace part or all of a patient's damaged liver with a healthy liver from a donor.\nBesides medical treatment, a reasonable diet also helps patients reduce the burden on the liver and quickly restore physical strength. Patients should proactively supplement foods rich in nutrients and good for health such as nuts, beans, fish, chicken, green vegetables, fruits... At the same time, patients should limit food intake. fast, greasy, animal organs, red meat..., abstain from beer, alcohol and quit smoking.\nIt is important to note that a person can get hepatitis C more than once. Therefore, after successful treatment, patients need to be extremely vigilant and seriously take preventive measures to prevent the infection from recurring. (5)",
