Some effective infection prevention methods are as follows:\nAbsolutely do not share needles: People who use intravenous drugs have a very high chance of being infected with hepatitis C because of sharing needles. In addition to needles, HCV can also exist in other devices such as straws and inhalers when using illegal drugs.; Avoid direct contact with blood or blood products: People working in the medical and testing industries need to be careful to avoid direct contact with the patient's blood. Medical equipment and instruments must be safely disposed of or properly sterilized after use to prevent hepatitis C infection; Do not share personal care items: Do not share items such as toothbrushes, razors, nail clippers and scissors to avoid getting blood on them and spreading the virus.; Choose a tattoo or piercing shop carefully: Choosing a reputable tattoo or piercing shop with appropriate hygiene procedures will help prevent infection.; Have safe sex: Do not have unprotected sex with multiple partners or with any partner who has an unhealthy health condition.\nIn addition, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, managing weight well, limiting exposure to liver-toxic agents such as tobacco, alcohol, stimulants, chemicals... and regular health check-ups is essential. Periodic treatment is also a method to help you protect your liver, detect early and promptly treat hepatitis C as well as other liver diseases.",
