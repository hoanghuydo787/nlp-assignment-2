Because at that time, blood circulation to the foot tendon area has decreased. This condition causes the heel tendon to lose flexibility, suppleness and elasticity. Therefore, any impact that occurs has the potential to injure the Achilles tendon.; People with flat foot syndrome are at high risk of developing Achilles tendonitis. The reason is that the body's weight will then fall heavily on the Achilles tendon, creating great pressure on this area, easily causing Achilles tendonitis.; Suffering from diseases: People with psoriasis or hypertension have a higher rate of inflamed heel tendons than people without the disease.; Effects of medications: Some antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones can increase the risk of Achilles tendonitis.",
