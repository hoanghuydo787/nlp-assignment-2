The patient may also be asked to stand on a ball to evaluate the flexibility, range of motion and reflexes of the foot and ankle. (3)\nIn addition, the doctor may prescribe the patient to perform a number of other tests such as:\nX-ray: This diagnostic method helps doctors observe images of the feet and leg bones. While an X-ray cannot provide an image of the tendon, it can help your doctor rule out other possible causes of similar symptoms.; Ultrasound: This method uses high-frequency sound waves to create detailed images of soft tissues such as tendons. In addition, ultrasound can also create images of the tendon's movement, so the doctor can evaluate blood flow around the tendon.; MRI scan: This is a diagnostic method that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the heel tendon, thereby helping doctors detect the location of the inflamed tendon.",
