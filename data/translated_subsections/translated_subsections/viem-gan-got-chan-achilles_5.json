    "subsection_content": "Some possible treatments for Achilles tendonitis are: (4)\nRICE\nMost minor injuries can heal on their own when the patient knows how to take good care of them. You can apply the R.I.C.E injury first aid method to treat Achilles tendonitis at home, specifically:\nRest - rest: Rest will help the body produce new energy, thereby increasing the ability to recover from tendon damage. This method also helps reduce pressure on the bones and heel tendons, helping the tendons relax and heal faster. The patient should rest until they can walk without feeling pain in the leg with tendinitis.\nIn addition, during rest, if you want to move, you should use crutches to support yourself and limit pressure on your legs.\nIce: The patient can place an ice pack on the injured area for about 15 - 20 minutes to reduce pain and swelling.; Compression: Use a cloth bandage or elastic bandage to immobilize the injured area, helping to reduce swelling of the tendon. However, you should not bandage too tightly because it can hinder blood circulation to the heel area, making the damage worse.; Elevation - elevating the injured position: The patient should raise the injured leg higher than the heart, helping to reduce swelling and pain effectively.\nUse medicine\nPatients can use over-the-counter pain relievers or anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen, ibuprofen, aspirin... In cases of long-term pain, the patient may be prescribed some pain relievers. inflammation or strong pain relief to improve symptoms. In addition, doctors can also give patients platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections or steroid injections.\nPhysical therapy\nA doctor or physical therapist may recommend certain treatments for Achilles tendonitis, such as:\nPerforming therapeutic exercises helps promote wound healing, helps strengthen the Achilles tendon and limits the risk of recurring inflammation.; Patients should use supportive devices such as cushions or elevated insoles to reduce stress on the tendons.\nAchilles tendon surgery\nWhen conservative treatment is not effective, your doctor may prescribe surgical intervention. In addition, this method is also indicated for cases of tendon rupture or risk of tendon rupture. Achilles tendon fusion surgery will help patients restore mobility.\nDuring surgery, the doctor will make an incision in the back of the heel. If the tendon is ruptured, the doctor will reattach it. If the tendon degenerates, the doctor will remove the damaged tendon and then repair the remaining tendon with sutures. In cases of severe tendon damage, the doctor may consider replacing part or all of the Achilles tendon.\nCurrently, Tam Anh General Hospital system has applied percutaneous Achilles tendon fusion surgery as a minimally invasive procedure. This method helps patients recover quickly, has smaller surgical scars, less pain, and minimizes the risk of complications.",
