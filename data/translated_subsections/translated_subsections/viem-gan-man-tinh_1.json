    "subsection_content": "There are many causes of chronic hepatitis, the most common of which are:(3)\nChronic hepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV): In Vietnam, more than 10% of the population is chronically infected with hepatitis B virus. In adults, about 5%-10% of people with acute hepatitis B become chronic. For children, acute hepatitis B becomes chronic in up to 90% of infants and 25-50% of young children.; Chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV): In Vietnam, more than 10% of the population is chronically infected with hepatitis B virus. In adults, about 5%-10% of people with acute hepatitis B become chronic. For children, acute hepatitis B becomes chronic in up to 90% of infants and 25-50% of young children.\nChronic hepatitis due to hepatitis C virus (HCV): In Vietnam, about 1% of the population is chronically infected with hepatitis C virus. More than 75% of patients with acute hepatitis C become chronic later.; Chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis C virus (HCV): In Vietnam, about 1% of the population is chronically infected with hepatitis C virus. More than 75% of patients with acute hepatitis C become chronic later.\nChronic hepatitis due to alcohol abuse: When the liver receives and processes alcohol, toxins that are harmful to the liver are produced. The more alcohol you drink or the longer you drink, the more it damages the liver, causing hepatitis to spread; over time leads to cirrhosis; Chronic hepatitis due to alcohol abuse: When the liver receives and processes alcohol, toxins that are harmful to the liver are produced. The more alcohol you drink or the longer you drink, the more it damages the liver, causing hepatitis to spread; Over time it leads to cirrhosis\nChronic hepatitis due to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Often occurs in people who are overweight, obese or have abnormal concentrations of cholesterol and other fats in the blood. This causes the body to synthesize more fat. As a result, a large amount of fat accumulates in liver cells, called fatty liver. Fatty liver can lead to chronic hepatitis and eventually progress to cirrhosis.; Chronic hepatitis due to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Often occurs in people who are overweight, obese or have abnormal concentrations of cholesterol and other fats in the blood.

The disease can occur in all subjects, mainly women.; Autoimmune hepatitis: Is a type of chronic hepatitis, caused by an immune disorder. The disease can occur in all subjects, mainly women.\nChronic hepatitis due to drugs: There are a few drugs that, if used for a long time, can cause chronic hepatitis such as amiodarone, isoniazid, methotrexate, methyldopa, nitrofurantoin, tamoxifen; more rare is acetaminophen; Chronic hepatitis due to drugs: There are a few drugs that, if used for a long time, can cause chronic hepatitis such as amiodarone, isoniazid, methotrexate, methyldopa, nitrofurantoin, tamoxifen; Less common is acetaminophen\nNote: Hepatitis A and E viruses do not cause chronic hepatitis. After acute inflammation, the disease can be completely cured",
