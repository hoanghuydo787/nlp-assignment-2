If there is, it's usually just a feeling of fatigue; This makes it easy for patients to mistake it for other health problems. About two-thirds of people with chronic hepatitis have no liver disorders until the disease progresses to cirrhosis.\nSigns of chronic hepatitis that may be encountered as the disease progresses may include:\nMild fever; Does not taste good; Feeling of discomfort in the upper abdomen; Body ache\nAs the disease gradually shows evidence of cirrhosis, symptoms may appear including:\nThe spleen is swollen; Appearance of small spider-like blood vessels (called spider angiomas); Red palms; Ascites (fluid collection in the abdomen); Or bleeding (coagulation disorder) because the damaged liver can no longer synthesize enough proteins to help blood clot.; Jaundice, itching; Impaired brain function (hepatic encephalopathy) because the severely damaged liver cannot remove toxic substances from the blood as usual. These substances then accumulate in the blood and reach the brain. Treatment of hepatic encephalopathy can prevent permanent decline in brain function.\nYellow eyes and skin are familiar symptoms of liver diseases",
