    "subsection_content": "To date, the cause of autoimmune hepatitis has not been clearly determined. Researchers still do not know why the immune system \"mistakes\" liver cells as a threat, thereby producing antibodies to cause liver damage. However, we can identify 4 factors that are closely related to autoimmune hepatitis.\n1. Viruses\nBacterial or viral infections are the cause of autoimmune hepatitis symptoms. Infections such as viral hepatitis (hepatitis A, B, C and D), herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus have also been implicated in the onset of the disease.\n2. Chemicals\nSome medications can cause liver damage in the form of autoimmune hepatitis. In most cases like this, liver damage will go away when the patient stops taking the medicine. Minocycline (an antibiotic used to treat acne) or nitrofurantoin (an antibiotic used to treat urinary infections) are two of the most common drugs that cause this condition.\n3. Autoimmune disease\nIf you have autoimmune diseases such as Grave's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, scleroderma, thyroiditis, type 1 diabetes, ulcerative colitis or Sjögren's syndrome, etc., you are also at risk of developing the formation of AIH.\n4. Gene\nAutoimmune hepatitis can affect you genetically. Although there is no specific explanation as to what factors affect the genome to form the disease, there are a number of suspected issues including mental stress or the use of drugs such as statins and hydralazine. antibiotics nitrofurantoin and minocycline.",
