Diagnostic method\nThe diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis requires consideration of many factors from family medical history, current symptoms, blood tests or liver biopsy.\nBlood tests: Symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis are very similar to those of viral hepatitis. Blood tests help rule out viral hepatitis, determine the type of autoimmune hepatitis you have, check liver function as well as look at the level of antibodies in the blood.(3); Liver biopsy: Performing a biopsy shows the type and extent of damage and inflammation of the liver.; Imaging: X-rays, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be performed between liver biopsies to quantify the degree of fibrosis and fat in the liver.",
