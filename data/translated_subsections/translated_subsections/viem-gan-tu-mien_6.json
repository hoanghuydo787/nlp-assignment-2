    "subsection_content": "As an autoimmune disease, autoimmune hepatitis has no definitive treatment. So whether the infection is type 1 or 2, the main goal in treating autoimmune hepatitis is to slow down or prevent the immune system's attack on the liver.\nPeople with AIH often use corticosteroids when symptoms first appear; Then other immunosuppressive drugs such as prednisone, azathioprine, mercaptopurine, etc. are combined to calm inflammation in the liver. Prednisone is often prescribed in high doses during the first month of taking the drug; Later, gradually reduce the oral dose to reduce the risk of side effects (osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, insomnia, muscle pain, depression, etc.). As for Azathioprine, the drug can cause nausea or vomiting in 10-15% of users. In addition, Azathioprine also increases the risk of lymphoma. If the patient cannot tolerate Azathioprine, some other medications can be used instead such as Cyclosporine, sirolimus (Rapamune) and tacrolimus (Prograf).\nWhen using medication, the disease can gradually improve after a few years of treatment - after 3 years, about 80% of people with autoimmune hepatitis find the disease is well controlled. However, the disease often relapses if the patient stops taking medication. Depending on the inflammation, the patient may need lifelong treatment.\nLiver transplantation is a treatment option for autoimmune hepatitis that is indicated in cases where the patient has cirrhosis or liver failure. Liver transplantation can be done thanks to living donation - at this time the patient only receives a part of the healthy liver so that the liver can continue to regenerate new cells. Although liver transplantation is the optimal treatment, autoimmune hepatitis still has a risk of recurrence even after successful organ transplantation.\nDuring treatment, an important point that patients need to pay attention to is building a healthy diet and regular exercise habits. This not only helps improve health, increase treatment effectiveness but also reduces the risk of fatty liver formation in people with autoimmune hepatitis.\nCorticosteroid medications are often prescribed for people with autoimmune hepatitis during the early stages of treatment",
