HP infection\nHelicobacter Pylori is the name of a type of spirochete, aerobic, gram-negative bacteria that exists in the first layer of the gastric mucosa and causes stomach-related diseases.\nHP bacteria normally enter the human body through the digestive tract. This is largely related to the area, environment and quality of life. When HP bacteria have entered the body, they can grow silently, causing increased acid levels and changes in the antral mucosal environment. During that process, the patient may not have any symptoms.\n2. Abuse of NSAID anti-inflammatory drugs\nAnti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs are one of the leading causes of antral gastritis. Patients need to comply with the use of this group of pain relievers according to the doctor's orders, avoid taking drugs arbitrarily, which can lead to serious stomach damage.\n3.
