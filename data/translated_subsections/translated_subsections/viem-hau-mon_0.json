    "subsection_content": "Anal inflammation is a condition in which the skin around the anal opening is irritated, leading to symptoms of pain, burning or itching in the anal area, especially during defecation. In some severe cases, patients may also have blood in their stools.\nThis is a digestive health disease, often coming from conditions such as digestive disorders. Anal inflammation occurs when the lining of the anal canal becomes infected. Due to similar symptoms, anal inflammation is often confused with hemorrhoids. However, these are two completely different diseases. According to epidemiology, anal inflammation is largely related to diet. Highly acidic foods such as coffee and foods that are too hot and spicy will stimulate.\nMore clearly about the anatomy of the anus, this is the last part of the digestive tract, located at the end of the rectum. The anus has the function of holding feces in the body before being excreted. The anus consists of a sphincter, which opens during the process of expelling feces. In addition, the anus also has flat cells lining the inside of the anus, and the anal margin. In particular, this flat cell is also the place where anal-related diseases such as anal inflammation or, more seriously, anal cancer begin.(2)\nAnal inflammation is an inflammation of the lining of the anal canal, considered a common disorder of digestive health. In addition to these secondary causes, anal inflammation can also be a genetic disease, especially inherited from STIs. However, this cause is not as common as secondary causes due to inappropriate diet in patients.\nAnal inflammation is neither related nor likely to develop into hemorrhoids, but the disease has a similar etiology and treatment to rectal mucositis. Therefore, people with inflammation of the rectal mucosa can also be concluded to have anal inflammation.\nThe disease can be treated simply medically, almost without surgery. Except for cases where the patient experiences more serious complications, greatly affecting the patient's health and life.(1)",
