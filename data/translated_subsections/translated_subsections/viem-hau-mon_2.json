    "subsection_content": "The cause of anal inflammation often comes from food and gastrointestinal disorders. These are considered secondary causes of anal inflammation in humans and the possibility of developing the disease will be even higher if the patient does not treat the cause properly or promptly.\n1. Intestinal inflammation\nEnteritis is an acute or chronic inflammation of the digestive tract, causing clinical symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea in patients.\nInflammatory bowel diseases include Crohn's and ulcerative colitis. The disease is the result of a cell-mediated immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Currently, there is still no official statement on the direct cause of intestinal inflammation, specifically crohn's and ulcerative colitis. However, based on statistics and medical evidence, the intestinal microbiota in people with multifactorial genetic predisposition has the ability to trigger abnormal immunity in this organ.\nInflammatory bowel disease is a disease with a high risk of leading to anal inflammation because the inflammation often takes place in the colon, which is close to the anal organ. Because of this nature of the disease, the infection can spread to the patient's anus.\n2. Sexually transmitted infections\nSexually transmitted infections, specifically STDs, are also considered the leading cause of anal inflammation. This cause is common in people who have regular anal sex.\nSexual intercourse has many potential risks of infection causing dangerous diseases, including anal inflammation. That's because the sexual organs in two individuals will be in direct contact with each other, for long periods of time. This is an opportunity for bad bacteria to be transmitted from person to person. The possibility of transmission is up to 90% if safety measures are not used, specifically condoms.\nNot only that, the friction will irritate the anus, sometimes causing damage such as scratches and swelling. From there, the risk of sexually transmitted anal inflammation in humans increases.\n3. Radiation therapy for cancer\nRadiation therapy for cancer is a method of destroying cancer cells with radiation. This is one of the optimal ways to treat cancer and brings positive results in cases where the disease is detected early.\nHowever, radiation will also cause other effects on the patient's health such as unwanted complications. Normally, diseases caused by radiotherapy are not too complicated, but need to be treated early to avoid causing additional physical and health inconveniences to the patient.\nGastrointestinal diseases such as stomach and duodenal ulcers are one of the complications caused by this radiation. And these health problems are also secondary causes of anal inflammation in patients. Therefore, people undergoing radiotherapy for cancer will have a high chance of developing anal inflammation during treatment.\nTo prevent this unwanted complication, patients need to strictly follow the doctor's treatment instructions. Besides, closely monitor your symptoms and health status. If there are any signs of anal inflammation, you should notify your doctor immediately so that they can be treated promptly.\n4. Overuse of antibiotics\nOveruse of antibiotics is one of the causes of stomach ulcers or duodenal ulcers. Arbitrary use of antibiotics not prescribed by doctors or medical professionals is always discouraged for patients.\nAntibiotics are drugs that inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria, often used in cases of acute inflammation caused by infection. However, antibiotics need to be used in the correct dosage depending on the type of disease and infection, otherwise the medicine will cause problems with stomach ulcers or other digestive organs.\nAnd because anal inflammation is a consequence of other digestive diseases, when a patient has gastric or duodenal ulcers due to overuse of antibiotics, it is likely to develop into anal inflammation.\n5. Eosinophilic condition\nEosinophils are white blood cells produced by the marrow, which are an accurate measure of the health of the human body. Eosinophils play an important role in the immune system, helping to destroy foreign parasites entering the body and regulating the inflammatory response.\nWhen the human body receives any abnormal invasion, eosinophils will destroy cells and fight those harmful bacteria. The normal index of eosinophils is about 50 - 500 cells/mm3.\nHowever, during work, typically regulating the inflammatory response in the human body, eosinophils will accumulate within the rectal mucosa. This phenomenon is the cause of anal inflammation in humans.\n6. Rectal inflammation\nProctitis or rectal mucosal inflammation is a disease with the same etiology and symptoms as anal inflammation. The main cause of this pathogenesis is because of the structure of the digestive system, the rectum and anus are two organs located next to each other. That's why the disease is one of the biggest causes of anal inflammation because inflammation in the rectal mucosa will affect neighboring locations first, specifically the anus.(3)\nNote that some medical centers do not emphasize the distinction between proctitis and anal inflammation. Because these two diseases have the same symptoms, pathogenesis and treatment methods. Therefore, when you are diagnosed with proctitis, it can also be understood that you have anal inflammation.\n7. Overuse of protein foods that cause inflammation\nProtein foods include protein-rich foods or functional foods that are a necessary element in every meal. However, you need to control your protein intake based on your health condition to limit the risk of disease caused by excess protein.\nMilk and dairy products are a typical protein-rich food, appearing in most meals. However, milk is a very high cause of constipation because it affects the production of gas inside the body. For a person who consumes milk and dairy products, the possibility of problems such as cramps and stomach pain is very high. These problems will lead to inconvenience during defecation, causing bleeding in the anus. From there, it affects the health of the rectum and anus, eventually causing anal inflammation in humans.",
