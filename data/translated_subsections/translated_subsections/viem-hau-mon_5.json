    "subsection_content": "Treatment of anal inflammation is usually not complicated and can be completely cured. However, the doctor will need to find the cause of the disease to be able to prescribe the optimal treatment regimen and method for the patient.\n1. Anal inflammation due to infection\nAnal inflammation caused by infection or progression from infectious diseases is usually treated medically with oral medications. The doctor will prescribe an antibiotic regimen to kill disease-causing bacteria. Normally, an anal inflammation treatment regimen with antibiotics will last 7-10 days. Patients need to be treated according to the correct antibiotic dosage prescribed by the doctor to completely eliminate bacteria and minimize complications from incorrect antibiotic use.\n2. Anal inflammation due to radiation effects\nSubjects with anal inflammation due to radiation from radiotherapy are often treated with topical medication when the patient has anal bleeding. Medications used to treat topical anal inflammation include foam corticosteroids, sucralfate douches, or hyperbaric oxygen therapy if the patient does not respond to the above treatments.\n3. Endoscopic treatment method\nEndoscopic treatment of anal inflammation is often used while the endoscopist diagnoses the disease. If the endoscopy results detect conditions such as bleeding, the doctor will stop the bleeding right away. Hemostasis can be achieved by laser, electrocautery or heating probe.",
