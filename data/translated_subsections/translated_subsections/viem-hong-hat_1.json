When conditions are favorable, they will attack and cause infection. Normally, the virus will attack first, then bacteria and fungi will continue to invade, causing superinfection. This causes the lymphocytes in the throat area to work continuously, overload and swell.; Attack of harmful agents: The oral cavity is frequently exposed to viruses, bacteria or disease-causing fungi.
