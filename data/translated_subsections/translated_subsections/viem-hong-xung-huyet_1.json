Influenza, Staphylococcus aureus.\nSources of viral and bacterial infection can come from the air, environment, food or related to common diseases such as colds, flu, diphtheria, chickenpox, mumps...\nIn addition to the viruses and bacteria mentioned above, some of the following favorable factors can also increase the risk of congestive sore throat:\nUnpredictable weather changes: Sudden changes in weather, especially during the changing seasons of the year in the North of our country, can easily cause congestive sore throat. This is because the body cannot adapt to changes in the environment, leading to reduced resistance and easy damage to the oropharynx. Immune deficiency: People with diseases such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, malnutrition, cancer... are more susceptible to congestive sore throat due to poor resistance to pathogens. Gastroesophageal reflux: Reflux of stomach acid can cause burning or ulcers in the nasopharynx, creating favorable conditions for viruses and bacteria to penetrate and cause infection. Environmental pollution: Smoky and chemical environments can increase the risk of congestive sore throat. Smoking: Smoking or frequent exposure to tobacco is one of the common factors that increases the risk of respiratory diseases, including congestive pharyngitis. Improper diet: Frequently eating spicy, hot foods, foods that are too hard, drinking a lot of alcohol can also cause damage to the throat mucosa. Stress and prolonged stress: Psychological instability, staying up late, and depression are also factors that affect health and increase the risk of congestive sore throat. Occupation: Occupations that require a lot of speaking and singing such as singers, speakers, teachers... are also more susceptible to damage to the throat mucosa than other people.; Unpredictable weather changes: Sudden changes in weather, especially during the changing seasons of the year in the North of our country, can easily cause congestive sore throat.
