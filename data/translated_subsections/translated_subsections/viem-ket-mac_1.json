    "subsection_content": "The most common infectious conjunctivitis is viral or bacterial conjunctivitis. Most cases of pink eye are caused by adenovirus but can also be caused by other viruses such as herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus. There are few cases where multiple agents combine to cause disease at the same time. [2]\nIn addition, there is also allergic conjunctivitis caused by foreign objects, smoke, dust, perfume, environmental pollution...[3]\n1. Conjunctivitis caused by viruses and bacteria\nBoth viral and bacterial conjunctivitis can occur along with a cold or symptoms of a respiratory infection, such as a sore throat. Wearing unclean contact lenses can also lead to bacterial conjunctivitis. Both types can affect one or both eyes. Both types are highly contagious through direct or indirect contact with secretions from the eyes of an infected person.\n2. Allergic conjunctivitis\nAllergic conjunctivitis occurs when the eyes come into contact with allergens such as pollen. To fight allergens, the body produces an antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE). IgE activates special cells in the lining of the eyes and respiratory tract to release inflammatory substances including histamine. The body's release of histamine can produce some allergy symptoms such as red eyes. This type of conjunctivitis is not contagious and most cases can be controlled with anti-allergy eye drops.\n3. Conjunctivitis due to irritation\nConjunctivitis may also be related to irritation caused by chemicals splashed into the eye or foreign objects falling into the eye. Therefore, the eyes will create an alarm mechanism, causing redness and tears to wash away chemicals or foreign objects causing irritation. Symptoms may include tearing and mucus discharge that usually resolves within 24 hours.\nIf cleaning with water does not control your symptoms or if the chemical in contact with your eyes is caustic such as lye, go to your nearest hospital or ophthalmologist immediately. Chemical splashes into the eyes can cause permanent eye damage.\nEyes play an extremely important role in human life activities",
