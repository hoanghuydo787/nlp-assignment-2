    "subsection_content": "There are many causes of conjunctivitis, in which a variety of manifestations appear.\n1. Bacterial infection\nInfectious causes often start from insects, direct contact with others, poor hygiene (touching eyes with unclean hands) or using contaminated eye makeup and lotions can also cause infection. . Sharing makeup and personal items such as contact lenses can also lead to bacterial conjunctivitis. [4]; May be caused by staphylococcus or streptococcus bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or less commonly Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.; Appears more in children than in adults; Usually occurs from December to April every year.; Can spread easily, especially with large numbers of bacteria in certain environments.; Thick eye discharge (pus) leads to eyelids sticking together; Sometimes occurs with otitis media.\n2. Viral infection\nCaused by the common cold virus and transmitted when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Viral conjunctivitis can also occur when the virus spreads along the body's mucous membranes, which connect the lungs, throat, nose, tear ducts, and conjunctiva. Because tears flow into the nasal passages, blowing your nose vigorously can cause the virus to move from the respiratory system to the eyes.; The discharge from the eyes is usually liquid, not thick; Usually starts in one eye and can spread to the other eye within a few days.; May occur along with symptoms of a cold, flu, or other respiratory infection.; Very contagious.; Can sometimes lead to major outbreaks depending on the type of virus.\n3. Allergy\nThe body's response to allergens, such as pollen from trees, plants, grass and weeds, dust, mold, pet dander, medications or cosmetics. [5]; Not contagious.; Occurs more often in people with other allergic diseases, such as hay fever, asthma, and eczema.; May occur seasonally when allergens such as pollen are present with greater frequency.; Can also occur year-round due to allergens that exist in the home (dust, fur).; Usually occurs in both eyes; Severe itching, tearing and swelling; May occur with allergy symptoms, such as itchy nose, runny nose, sneezing, itchy throat, or asthma.\nAllergens such as dust, pet hair, etc. are the cause of conjunctivitis\n4. Chemical splashes into eyes\nPoisoning is caused by fumes, liquids, fumes or corrosive chemicals. Rinse with water immediately to remove toxic substances. [6]; Cases of pinkeye caused by chlorine in swimming pools are usually not serious and do not require treatment. After washing your eyes, you can use artificial tears or ointment to reduce redness and irritation.; Symptoms of severe pink eye caused by toxic chemicals include: severe pain, decreased vision, red eyes, swelling.; Need to be taken immediately to the nearest medical center or hospital for timely consultation and treatment.; Not contagious.\n5. Foreign objects in the eye\nCaused by irritation from a foreign body in the eye or exposure to smoke, dust, fumes or chemicals; Pain, redness and excessive tearing; Not contagious.\n6. Clogged tear duct\nBlocked tear ducts lead to eye irritation and tear accumulation.; This irritation causes pain and swelling, causes the eyes to constantly water and increases the risk of infection.; Mucus discharge from eyes.; Dried discharge that forms crusts on the eyes.; Blurred vision.; Swelling of one side of the nose near the eye; Bleeding eyes, possibly fever.\n7. Use contact lenses\nGiant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) is a type of allergic conjunctivitis caused by the chronic presence of foreign bodies in the eye. People who wear hard or hard contact lenses, wear soft contact lenses that are not replaced regularly, have open stitches on the eye surface, or have prosthetic eyes are more likely to develop this form of conjunctivitis.; Failure to keep contact lenses clean will lead to increased bacteria and dirt buildup, increasing the risk of infection.; Itching and burning in both eyes; Weep.; Mild swelling.; Sensitive and uncomfortable.; Not contagious.\n7. Contact with other people who have conjunctivitis\nDirect contact with a person who has conjunctivitis is very susceptible to infection because the conjunctivitis virus often spreads from the patient to others through personal contact such as touching or shaking hands, and is spread through the air through coughing and sneezing. steam or touch objects or surfaces that have germs, then touch your eyes before washing your hands.",
