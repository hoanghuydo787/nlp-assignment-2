    "subsection_content": "Most cases of viral conjunctivitis are mild and will resolve on their own after 7-14 days without treatment without leaving sequelae. However, there are also cases where the illness takes 2-3 weeks or more. Your doctor may prescribe antiviral medications to treat more serious forms of conjunctivitis, such as conjunctivitis caused by the herpes simplex virus or varicella-zoster virus. Antibiotics will not be effective in this case.\nMild bacterial conjunctivitis can improve on its own in 2-5 days without antibiotic treatment and without any complications, but it can take up to 2 weeks to completely heal. Antibiotic prescriptions prescribed by doctors in this case are usually topical medications such as eye drops or ointments. Antibiotics can help shorten the duration of the infection, reduce complications, and reduce the spread of it to others.\nConjunctivitis caused by allergies (such as pollen or animal dander) often improves by removing the allergen from the environment. Antihistamines and certain eye drops (antihistamines and topical vasoconstrictors), including some prescription eye drops, may also help relieve symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. Your doctor may recommend a combination of medications to improve your condition.\nFlushing the eyes with saline is the standard medical treatment for chemical conjunctivitis. Patients may also consider needing to use topical steroids. Eye damage caused by chemicals is often quite serious, especially alkali burns are a medical emergency and can lead to scarring, impaired vision, and can even cause blindness. If the chemical comes into direct contact with the eyes, flush the eyes with water for several minutes before taking the victim to the nearest medical center.",
