However, some cases that are not treated promptly have the risk of serious progression over time, leading to chronicity with many dangerous complications as follows:\nDestruction of bones and cartilage: Inflamed joints can affect muscles, tendons, and ligaments, causing bones and joints to weaken. In particular, the disease can also cause inflammation of the joint capsule, reducing the quality of joint fluid. This causes joint cartilage to lack nutrients and gradually become dry and flaky. The bone under the cartilage also has different solid and hollow areas, leading to constant pain; Joint deformity: As the disease progresses, tumors will appear in the inflamed joint area. The joint cannot keep its original shape, becomes rough, or even shifts to one side, affecting mobility.",
