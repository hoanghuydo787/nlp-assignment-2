    "subsection_content": "The wrist joint is made up of many small bones and joints, along with an intertwined system of ligaments, blood vessels and nerves. The wrist joint consists of two main groups: the bones and the soft tissue. These two parts work together smoothly to help the hand move flexibly. The structure of the wrist bones and joints is also divided into two groups: the wrist bone group and the wrist joint group.\nThe structure of the wrist joint includes: the radiocarpal-carpal joint, the lower radioulnar-ulnar joint, the joint between the wrist bones (including the distal and proximal wrist bones), and the joints between the carpal and metacarpal bones.\nInferior radioulnar joint: This is a axial joint that connects the distal ends of the radius and ulna. The joint is held steady by a fibrous capsule surrounding the joint surface and the articular disc connecting the two ends of the bones together. The function of the joint is to stabilize and allow rotation of the forearm. The rotator cuff is responsible for rotating around the ulna while the ulna remains in a certain position. The movements of the distal radioulnar joint are pronation and supination of the hand.; Radius-carpal joint: This is one of the main joints in the wrist area. The joint is located in the radius area in contact with the first row of wrist bones to support activities such as flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction. The combination of the above movements allows the hand to rotate.; Joint between the wrist bones: Is the joint between the distal and proximal wrist bones. This joint allows the bones to easily move up, down, left, right... and helps the wrist move smoothly.; Wrist-carpal joint: Includes 5 joints between the wrist and hand bones. The wrist joint of the thumb is called the saddle joint, which helps the fingers move forward and backward from side to side. The wrist joints of the other fingers are facet joints, allowing for up-and-down and side-to-side movement. The wrist joint in the little finger always has more flexibility in movement.\nStructure of the wrist joint",
