    "subsection_content": "Some common causes of wrist arthritis include:\n1. Trauma\nWrist arthritis can develop after injury; this is often called post-traumatic arthritis. Inflammation may appear quickly after the injury or may appear over a long period of time.\nInflammation can develop after any fracture that enters the joint, especially in cases where the bone does not heal properly. Ligament injuries can also cause bones to not be able to move together properly. This can also be the cause of arthritis when they rub against each other.\n2. Osteoarthritis of the wrist\nLike arthritis in other locations, degenerative arthritis of the wrist is one of the most common types. Over time, degenerated articular cartilage will lose elasticity, gradually thin, dry and crack, then lead to ulcers, gradual loss of cartilage organization, and inert ends of the bones under the cartilage.\nThis type of arthritis often appears in middle age or in the elderly due to the effects of the aging process. The characteristics of osteoarthritis are pain, redness, dryness, and especially difficulty moving the joints. When moving, a \"clunk\" sound often appears. This is considered a natural human evolution.\nSwelling and pain are some of the symptoms of wrist arthritis.\n3. Autoimmune disease\nIn some cases, the body's immune cells accidentally attack the body's own components, at which point the phenomenon of inflamed joints due to autoimmune disease will occur, specifically: (2)\nRheumatoid arthritis: is a chronic, systemic arthritis. The disease is considered an autoimmune disease with the participation of many factors such as infection or genetics. The disease is common in middle-aged women and is characterized by symmetrical polyarthritis and morning stiffness, especially in the wrist and finger joints on both sides. The disease has a chronic course with acute episodes. During the acute phase, many joints are often swollen and painful, accompanied by fever and may have internal manifestations.; Psoriatic arthritis: The disease not only has external manifestations on the skin but also attacks the joints. The disease often causes asymmetrical peripheral arthritis, accompanied by damage to the spine - sacroiliac.; Systemic lupus erythematosus: is a disease belonging to the group of autoimmune diseases of unknown cause, manifested by inflammation in many organizations. The disease is common in women and young people. Regarding joint damage in systemic lupus erythematosus, there may be acute, subacute or chronic polyarthritis. Patients may have symptoms of arthritis in the ankles, wrists, fingers, etc.; Ankylosing spondylitis: is a chronic inflammatory joint disease of unknown cause. The disease is common in young men and has a clear familial pattern. Common symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis are chronic pain in the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints. In addition, the disease can also manifest in peripheral joints such as arthritis of the wrists, ankles, and knees...\n4. Metabolic disorders\nA typical example of this group of metabolic disorders is gout. The cause of the disease is protein metabolism disorders in the body, with the main characteristic being increased blood uric acid. From there, it causes the deposition of urate crystals in soft tissue under the skin causing tophi particles, or in the kidneys causing nephritis, kidney failure, kidney stones... Compared to other bone and joint diseases, the pain caused by acute gout attacks is low. Severe, inflamed, hot, red joints and severe edema.\n5. Other causes\nCarpal tunnel syndrome: is caused by compression of the median nerve in the wrist or inflammation of the median nerve. The syndrome often appears in people over 40, or people who work in offices and use computers a lot. Symptoms often appear gradually, at first the symptoms appear infrequently, then they often last long and continuously, including symptoms of numbness and sharp pain at the tips of the thumb, 2nd and 3rd fingers. and pain in the palm of the hand...; Flexor tendonitis of the common digits, extensor tendonitis of the common digits, long extensor tendonitis of the thumb...: causes swelling, pain, and limited movement in the wrist.",
