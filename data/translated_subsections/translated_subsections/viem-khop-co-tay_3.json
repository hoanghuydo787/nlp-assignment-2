The pain may gradually increase, be persistent, or may have a sudden onset.\n2. Joint stiffness\nPersistent pain when the wrist joint is inflamed, if not treated promptly, can lead to joint stiffness. At this time, joints often appear stiff and difficult to grip.\n3. Swelling\nSwelling, inflammation, heat, and pain may occur as the disease progresses. The skin surrounding the joint is often swollen, red and hotter than the surrounding areas.\n4. Limit movement\nOne of the worrying things about this disease is the limitation of movement, making it difficult to move flexibly. If not checked and treated, the disease can progress rapidly. Long term can lead to joint adhesions, muscle atrophy, and loss of joint function.\nWrist arthritis needs to be treated quickly and promptly.",
