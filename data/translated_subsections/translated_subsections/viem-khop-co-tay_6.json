From there, muscle atrophy, joint adhesion, and joint deformity will occur, causing loss of mobility.; For systemic bone and joint diseases (autoimmune arthritis), damage not only occurs in the joints but also occurs in the skin as well as some internal organs. If not controlled quickly, some of these diseases can lead to many dangerous complications as well as direct health threats.",
