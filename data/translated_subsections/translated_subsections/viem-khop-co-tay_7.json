    "subsection_content": "Currently, wrist arthritis can be treated with many different methods. In order to improve the best possible effectiveness, the doctor will develop a treatment regimen for each case based on the cause of the disease, the severity of the disease, co-morbidities, and the patient's age and job. (4)\n1. Anti-inflammatory drugs and medications that treat the cause\nAnti-inflammatory drugs: pain relievers and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used drugs to treat this condition.; In addition, depending on the cause of wrist joint pain, the doctor will prescribe groups of drugs that affect the pathogenesis of the disease to help thoroughly treat the disease and avoid recurrence.; Although using medication is the preferred method, you should not overuse it or use it incorrectly as it can cause many dangerous side effects and complications. Therefore, it is necessary to consult a doctor before use, and must strictly comply with drug and dosage instructions.\n2. Local injection\nIf your symptoms are moderate or severe, your doctor may give you a local anti-inflammatory injection. Wrist joint injections have an anti-inflammatory effect, reducing and temporarily improving inflammation symptoms.\nIn addition, in some cases of arthritis or chronic soft tissue inflammation around the joints, doctors can use some new local injections such as platelet-rich plasma injections or collagen injections for joints to help bring effective results. optimal and long lasting.\n3. Physical therapy\nPhysical therapy techniques need to be performed in combination with medication to control pain, restore wrist joint function, and prevent cartilage degeneration.\nIn the treatment of wrist arthritis, applied physical therapy techniques include:\nWearing a splint: With the function of immobilizing the joint, reducing mechanical impact and pressure on the wrist area, the splint can help patients reduce pain, stiffness, swelling and inflammation. At the same time, splints play an important role in supporting the recovery of joint damage; Apply cold: When the wrist shows signs of swelling, heat, and edema due to injury, the best way in this case is to apply an ice pack to the joint for 10 - 15 minutes. When applying cold compresses, the temperature from the compress helps constrict blood vessels, reduce inflammation and significantly reduce pain in the joint area.; Perform exercises: Patients can perform exercises specifically for the wrist and finger areas as recommended by the doctor. This method is intended to reduce pressure on nerves, improve mobility and help slow down the aging process and progression of chronic bone and joint disease.\n4. Surgery\nWhen wrist arthritis is severe and conservative treatments cannot respond, in this case, the doctor may recommend surgery. The doctor may prescribe a number of surgical techniques depending on the cause of wrist joint damage such as:\nRemove bone spurs; Apply a cast to the wrist joint if the injury leads to torn ligaments or bone fractures; Surgical decompression of carpal tunnel syndrome, long tendonitis - shortening of the thumb; Surgical removal of tophi in case of gout; In cases where the joint is seriously damaged, the solution the doctor offers may be to replace the damaged organ with artificial materials.\nIn general, surgery is more effective than conservative treatment. Surgery should only be performed when prescribed by a specialist because surgical intervention has potential complications and risks.",
