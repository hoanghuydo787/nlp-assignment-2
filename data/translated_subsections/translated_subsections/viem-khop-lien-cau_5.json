    "subsection_content": "Clinical diagnosis\nPeople with streptococcal arthritis need to provide complete information about their current condition as well as the progression of the disease from the beginning and medical history. These are important data that help doctors make an accurate diagnosis.\nTest\nBlood tests: Doctors check the number of polymorphonuclear white blood cells, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, pro-calcitonin.; Joint fluid test: The doctor punctures the joint to do cell count, gram stain, and pus culture to look for bacteria. Color and odor characteristics of joint fluid can also suggest a bacterial joint infection.\nBlood culture\nThe doctor will take a blood sample from the patient and culture the bacteria. Thereby, doctors can identify the strain of disease-causing bacteria traveling in the blood to come up with an appropriate treatment plan.\nDiagnosis by imaging\nThe doctor may prescribe X-rays, ultrasound or MRI to determine the location and extent of damage to the joint.\nThe process of diagnosing the disease is relatively more complicated than diagnosing common bone and joint diseases. However, once the correct bacterial strain and level of joint damage have been determined, treatment will no longer be too difficult.",
