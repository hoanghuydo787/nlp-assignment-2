    "subsection_content": "Osteoarthritis\nThis is the most common type of finger arthritis. The cartilage layer gradually degenerates (erodes) and exposes the bone under the joint. The joints directly affected are: (2)\nProximal interphalangeal joint (PIP joint); DIP joint; Joint at the base of the thumb\nRheumatoid arthritis\nRheumatoid arthritis arises due to autoimmune disease. When sick, the soft tissues around the joints tend to become inflamed and swollen. The joint most affected is the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP).\nGout\nGout occurs when the body cannot metabolize uric acid properly. These molecules will gradually accumulate, forming crystals inside the joint. Joints will become inflamed and swollen, causing pain and reducing the patient's range of motion. Although this disease mainly affects the legs, in some cases, the finger joints can also be affected.",
