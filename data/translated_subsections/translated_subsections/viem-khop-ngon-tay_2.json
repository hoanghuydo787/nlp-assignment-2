    "subsection_content": "Finger joint pain\nThis is the first and most common symptom. Pain may appear at the base of the finger when holding or grasping an object or using force with the fingers. Initially, the pain only appears when the patient holds an object. With activity, the pain will lessen. After a few minutes of rest, stiffness and pain will increase. If the inflammation is more severe, pain in the finger joints may appear even when you rest.\nFinger deformities\nAs the disease progresses, in addition to increased pain, the patient's fingers also tend to deform. The knuckles begin to point in one direction (towards the little finger). This is a phenomenon of deviation towards the ulna, causing pain and weakness in the hand. Patients have many difficulties using their hands in daily activities.\nInterphalangeal joint deformity\nThis is a condition in which the interphalangeal joints are flexed or hyperextended, creating characteristic deformities. Swan neck deformity occurs when the proximal interphalangeal joints are loose and hyperextended, while the distal interphalangeal joints are flexed. Boutonniere deformity is a condition in which the proximal interphalangeal joints are flexed and the distal interphalangeal joints are extended.\nSwelling of interphalangeal joints\nThe proximal interphalangeal joints are enlarged on the posterior surface, causing swelling and pain, forming Bouchard spots. The distal interphalangeal joints are swollen, forming Heberden's nodules.\nIn addition, inflamed finger joints also have a number of other symptoms such as swelling, stiffness, warmth, pain at the base of the finger, reduced grip strength, reduced range of motion, and the joint at the base of the finger becomes enlarged or looks different. see a bone.",
