    "subsection_content": "Aging: Finger arthritis often occurs with aging. As you get older, the aging process occurs, causing bones, joints, and cartilage to weaken, increasing the risk of finger osteoarthritis.; Injury: Previous injuries such as severe sprains, fractures or finger joint injuries can affect the joint cartilage, causing changes in joint activity. When damage causes the joint to change its arrangement and movement, force will increase on the surface of the joint cartilage, gradually destroying the joint cartilage. Because articular cartilage does not have the ability to heal itself well, the injury will become more and more serious, and signs of finger osteoarthritis will appear.\nIn addition, there are a number of factors that increase the risk of finger arthritis such as:\nFemale; Over 40 years old; Overweight, obesity; Some genetic conditions: Loose joint ligaments, deformed joints...; Suffering from diseases that change the normal structure and function of articular cartilage; Activities and jobs that put pressure on the fingers",
