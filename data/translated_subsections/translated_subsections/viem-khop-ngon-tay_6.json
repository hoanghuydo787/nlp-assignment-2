    "subsection_content": "Treatment is non-surgical\nIn the early stages, treatment of finger arthritis mainly uses non-surgical methods including:\n1. Take oral medication\nWhen finger joints only hurt when working a lot or doing heavy work, the doctor will prescribe the patient to use pain relievers and anti-inflammatory drugs. In addition, patients also need to limit heavy activities or stop doing work that requires repetitive movements of the hands and fingers. This will help control symptoms better.\n2. Use injections\nPlatelet-rich plasma stimulates epithelial cells, creates matrix, divides cells, regenerates blood cells, stimulates blood vessel development, thereby supporting the regeneration of damaged tissues, helping cells stay healthy. stronger. For musculoskeletal injuries, the effect of platelet-rich plasma is anti-inflammatory, quickly stops pain, and improves mobility for muscles and joints.\n3. Cortisone\nThe doctor may prescribe the patient to inject Cortisone (a strong anti-inflammatory drug) into the finger joint to temporarily relieve pain. The effects of the drug are temporary, lasting only a few weeks to a few months. This procedure also comes with the risk of joint infection.\n4. Physical therapy\nPhysical therapy exercises play an important role when patients undergo medical treatment. The goal of these exercises is to help patients control symptoms well and maintain stability for the hands and joints.\nPhysical therapists will guide you on how to relieve pain and symptoms through methods such as rest, pain relief with heat, and the use of topical medications. Range of motion and muscle tension exercises will help patients improve finger mobility. Exercises to increase hand and arm strength help stabilize the hand and protect fingers from shock or pressure.\n5. Elastic bandage or finger splint\nThis is a treatment method that helps reduce pain, properly position the joint, prevent joint deformity, and help the joint rest. Patients can wear the brace at night or wear it all day if they do not feel any obstacles in their work or daily activities.\nTreatment includes surgical intervention\nWhen finger arthritis is severe, medical treatment methods are not effective. The doctor may recommend that the patient undergo surgery. Commonly used surgical methods in the treatment of finger arthritis include:\n6. Bone welding\nThis is a treatment method that aims to eliminate pain by allowing the bones that make up the joint to grow toward each other or fuse together to form a solid bone mass. Bone fusion is effective in treating pain and joint deformity caused by degenerative inflammation.\nThis method is often used for the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints, and is more effective than trying to maintain finger joint movement by replacing the joint. Although bone fusion helps relieve pain in that joint, it will cause loss of movement.\n7. Artificial joint replacement\nWhen performing artificial joint replacement, doctors use plastic or metal artificial joints to replace inflamed joints. The replaced joint will form a new hinge, allowing the joint to move freely, while reducing pain for the patient.",
