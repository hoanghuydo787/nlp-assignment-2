This bacteria can live on normal, healthy skin.

Some less common causes of the disease are penetrating injuries, after drug injections or after surgery in or near the joint.\nThe resistance of the joint synovial membrane is relatively weak and cannot prevent the risk of attack by pathogens. The body's reaction when under attack from agents (inflammatory response) has the ability to increase pressure in the joint, reduce blood flow to the joint, thereby making the damage worse.\nSome common causes of the disease are due to abnormal changes in the joints such as:\nJoint injuries; Other forms of arthritis; Immune system deficiency caused by other diseases such as diabetes, kidney disease or cancer and specific medications to treat these diseases; Have ever had an artificial joint implant\nSome risk factors for septic arthritis include:\nExisting joint problems: Conditions and diseases related to the joints (osteoarthritis, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, artificial joints, joint injuries, joint surgery...) may increase the risk. muscles cause joint inflammation; Using drugs to treat rheumatoid arthritis: People with rheumatoid arthritis will face the risk of infectious arthritis.
