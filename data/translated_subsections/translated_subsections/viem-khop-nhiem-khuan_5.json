    "subsection_content": "1. Use antibiotics\nSeptic arthritis is often diagnosed and treated early with antibiotics. The doctor will rely on the test results to choose an antibiotic capable of killing the bacteria causing arthritis.\nThe patient will be injected with antibiotics intravenously to ensure that the inflamed joint quickly receives medicine to kill bacteria, then antibiotics will be administered orally. Most symptoms will improve within about 48 hours of the first antibiotic treatment. Treatment usually lasts 2 - 6 weeks.\nSide effects of antibiotics can include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Therefore, patients need to discuss with their doctor in advance about unwanted side effects from treatment medications.\n2. Joint fluid drainage\nYour doctor may need to remove synovial fluid from the infected joint if the infection re-releases the fluid too quickly. Draining infected fluid from the joint helps remove bacteria from the joint, relieves pressure on the joint, and provides the doctor with a sample to test for bacteria and other organisms. The common method of synovial fluid removal is through arthroscopy.\n3. Other treatment options\nAspiration of inflamed joint fluid can be performed using an arthroscopic needle. This treatment can be repeated every day until there are no bacteria left in the joint fluid. If infectious arthritis occurs in the hip joint, the patient may need open surgery to drain the fluid. In some cases, surgery can be performed multiple times to ensure 100% removal of bacteria from joint fluid.\nOnce the infection is under control, the patient may be encouraged to move gently to maintain joint function. Light movement will help prevent joint stiffness and muscle weakness. In addition, movement also supports blood circulation, helping the recovery process progress faster.",
