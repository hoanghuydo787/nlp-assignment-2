    "subsection_content": "Most patients with reactive arthritis have a good prognosis, with symptoms relieving quickly and recovering in a few weeks, months or sooner if detected early and actively treated as prescribed by the doctor.\nHowever, the disease becomes dangerous when the patient subjectively does not comply with the doctor's treatment instructions, combined with unscientific living and eating habits, causing disease symptoms to gradually increase. In the long term, the symptoms become more severe, causing difficulty and hindering the patient's daily activities. If not treated promptly and properly, it can lead to lifelong disability.\nThe disease has a risk of recurrence or becoming chronic (especially in patients with genetic factors). Statistics show that about 15 - 30% of cases are complicated by ankylosing spondylitis.",
