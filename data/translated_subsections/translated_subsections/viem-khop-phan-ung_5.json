Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to eliminate disease-causing bacteria remaining in the body (this antibiotic will depend on the type of bacteria present in the body).\nSome medications commonly prescribed in disease treatment include:\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Effective in reducing symptoms of pain and inflammation caused by the disease; Corticosteroids: Effective in preventing osteoarthritis, reducing inflammatory symptoms and helping musculoskeletal joints function normally.; When it progresses to Chronic Arthritis, treatment with classic DMARDs such as Methotrexate, Sulfasalazine, etc. may be needed.\nRecommendation: Patients should only use the correct medication and the full dosage as prescribed by the doctor, avoid arbitrarily using medication without a prescription, avoid side effects as well as serious effects of using the wrong medication. .\nPractice physical therapy\nExercise has been proven to be one of the effective methods to help improve function, increase strength and flexibility for musculoskeletal joints. Recommend patients to practice exercises as prescribed by their doctor, avoid over-exercising which can have negative effects on weak musculoskeletal areas.\nRehabilitation exercises are tailored to each patient with aseptic arthritis\nHow long does it take for reactive arthritis to go away?\nHow long it takes to recover from the disease will depend on genetic factors and the patient's physical condition. For patients with good health, a good immune system, active treatment and full implementation of the doctor's instructions, the disease can improve after 1-2 weeks. For patients with poor resistance or underlying diseases, treatment will last longer, possibly taking from several months to several years.\nOne thing to note is that this disease has a complete risk of recurrence if not treated properly, especially in people with genetic risk factors, the recurrence rate is up to 50%. Therefore, patients should go for examination and treatment at a large and reputable medical facility to completely cure the disease, avoiding unpleasant symptoms and dangerous complications of torture.",
