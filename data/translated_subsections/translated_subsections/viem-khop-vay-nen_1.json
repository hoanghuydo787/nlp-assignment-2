    "subsection_content": "Based on the location of the inflamed and damaged joints, psoriatic arthritis is divided into 5 types (2), including:\n1. Symmetrical arthritis\nStatistics show that about 50% of patients have this type. This is a type of arthritis that affects joints symmetrically on both sides, such as the patient's left and right knee joints. Patients may experience symptoms similar to rheumatoid arthritis, but they tend to be milder and have less joint deformity. However, patients should not be subjective because this condition can cause complete disability of the joints.\n2. Asymmetrical arthritis\nThis form affects joints on one side of the body, mostly 4 joints or less. About 35% of patients have this type.\n3. Inflammation of the joints distal to the toes and hands\nThis form involves the joints closest to the nail, called the distal joints. Statistics show that about 10% of psoriatic arthritis patients have this form.\nPsoriatic arthritis can occur in the distal joints of the toes and hands\n4. Inflammation in the spine\nThis form involves the patient's spine. The entire spine from the neck to the lower back can be affected, causing pain every time you move, symptoms similar to ankylosing spondylitis. Surrounding parts such as hands, feet, arms, legs, and hips may also be affected.\n5. Arthritis destroys joint cartilage\nThis is the most serious form of psoriatic arthritis, which can destroy joint cartilage and deform the joints. About 5% of patients have this form of the disease.",
