    "subsection_content": "Psoriatic arthritis can affect many organs in the body, specifically:\n1. For skin, hair and nails\nThe disease is common in people with psoriasis with symptoms of rough, red patches on the skin and nails, most commonly in joints near the nails of fingers and toes. At this time, nails can become thick, hard and rough, nail color also changes and there are signs of peeling. In other cases, the nail may separate from the nail bed, called nail separation.\n2. For the musculoskeletal system\nAlong with the impact on the skin, psoriasis causes painful inflammation, stiffness and swelling in one joint or many joints (polyarthritis), making it difficult for the patient to move.\nIf your fingers and toes are swollen and shaped like sausages, it is called Dactylitis.\nPsoriatic arthritis causes swollen, sausage-shaped finger joints, also known as Dactylitis\nIn addition, some patients have symptoms of pain in the neck and back, difficulty in bending and extending the spine.\nThe disease can affect the surrounding ligaments and tendons, erode bones, and increase diseases in the musculoskeletal system.\n3. For the immune system\nPsoriatic arthritis is one of the autoimmune diseases of the musculoskeletal system, meaning the body's immune system confuses and attacks beneficial cells in its structure. As a result, it can lead to a number of infections such as strep throat, dermatitis, etc.\n4. For eyesight\nStatistics show that about 7% of patients experience complications of uveitis - a disease related to eye inflammation. Besides, a small number of cases are not detected early and intervened promptly, causing permanent vision loss.\n5. For the digestive system\nPsoriatic arthritis patients are eight times more likely to develop Crohn's disease (an inflammatory bowel disease that causes diarrhea and other digestive system problems) than normal people.\n6. For the respiratory system\nWhen arthritis spreads to the lungs, it can lead to interstitial pneumonia. Patients may cough a lot, feel tired and may have difficulty breathing.\n7. For the cardiovascular system\nStatistics show that patients are at high risk of suffering damage to the heart and vascular system such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol... When inflammation damages blood vessels, causing vessel walls to harder and thicker, can leave scars, and in the long run increases the risk of stroke.\n8. For mental health\nPatients are at risk of prolonged depression, frequent anxiety, loss of confidence, optimism... when living with unpleasant and persistent symptoms of the disease.",
