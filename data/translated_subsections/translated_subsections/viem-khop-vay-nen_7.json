Current methods mainly focus on controlling arthritis, avoiding severe effects on joints and surrounding organs, preventing pain and the risk of permanent disability.\nThe treatment regimen for psoriatic arthritis is a combination of treating disease symptoms as soon as they appear, while also combining the healing of damage to the skin and joints. Specifically:\nCombine drug treatment and guide remedial measures for patients; physical therapy, rehabilitation of motor organs; For mild joint damage: Use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) alone or in combination with corticosteroid injections at the inflammation site.; For moderate and severe injuries: Use basic treatment drugs such as methotrexate or biological products.\nMost drugs used in disease treatment are effective on skin lesions, specifically drug groups include:\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) help reduce pain, swelling and morning stiffness, and are used in the first treatments for arthritis patients.
