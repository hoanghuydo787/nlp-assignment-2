In addition, serious complications can arise in organ systems throughout the body such as: Rheumatoid nodules Sjogren's syndrome Pericarditis Vasculitis Pleuritis Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Fibrositis hard; Low notes; Sjogren's syndrome; Pericarditis; Vasculitis; Pleurisy; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); Scleritis; Lupus: Complications caused by lupus can damage any area of ​​the body, such as the skin, heart, lungs, kidneys, blood, and brain.\nIf you become pregnant while having lupus, you are more likely to have miscarriages, high blood pressure during pregnancy, and premature birth.\nGout: High uric acid levels are the cause of kidney stones in gout patients. If you have poor kidney function, you are also at risk of acute uric acid nephropathy (AUAN), which causes kidney function to decline rapidly.; Ankylosing spondylitis: When the space between the vertebrae gradually narrows, causing the vertebrae to fuse, the spine will become stiff and inflexible. In addition, the disease also affects other joints such as the hip joint, shoulder joint, jaw joint, sacroiliac joint... as well as causing problems with the eyes, heart, lungs, digestive system... and makes the patient face risk of disability; Infectious arthritis: causes inflammation from the joints to the articular cartilage and bone ends. If not treated promptly, it will cause joint dislocation and loss of mobility. Furthermore, inflammation in the spine also causes spinal cord compression and scoliosis; If the bacteria spreads to other organs such as the liver, lungs, and kidneys, it will cause inflammation and abscess; Reactive arthritis: Not only does it reduce the patient's quality of life, reactive arthritis also affects other organs, causing complications such as keratinization in the palms of the hands, feet and head; conjunctivitis, keratitis, eye socket pain; inflammation of the prostate, bladder, foreskin; sterile pyuria, microscopic hematuria...; Fibromyalgia: The prolonged and widespread pain of fibromyalgia will leave the patient in a constant state of fatigue, even depression and frequent insomnia. If left untreated for a long time, the disease will cause a series of complications such as headaches, lower abdominal pain, restless legs syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, sleep apnea...",
