Some people find that ice packs and patches are effective in relieving pain. Others use mobility aids, such as canes or walkers, to take pressure off painful joints.\nAlong with pain improvement measures, your doctor will prescribe you a number of other methods to control symptoms, such as:\nUse medicine\nSome commonly prescribed arthritis medications are:\nPain relievers: hydrocodone (Vicodin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) are effective in controlling pain, but do not help reduce inflammation.; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): ibuprofen (Advil) and salicylates, which help control pain and inflammation; Menthol or capsaicin cream: blocks the transmission of pain signals from the joints to the brain.; Immunosuppressants (prednisone or cortisone) help reduce inflammation.\nSurgery\nSurgery to replace artificial joints is indicated for patients with severe arthritis and all treatments are ineffective. This surgery is most commonly performed on the hip and knee.\nIf your inflammation is most severe in your finger or wrist joints, your doctor may perform a joint fusion.\nPhysical therapy\nPhysical therapy is a treatment that uses exercises to help strengthen the muscles around the affected joint. Based on the patient's physical condition and level of arthritis, the doctor will set them up with appropriate exercises to reduce pain, increase joint flexibility and increase joint range of motion. Some mild and moderate arthritis can be cured after a period of physical therapy.\nAppropriate physical therapy exercises are effective medicine for patients\nTreatment at home\nThe following habits help patients effectively control symptoms (3):\nExercise regularly: Gentle exercise is very beneficial for improving symptoms as well as enhancing overall health. Ask your doctor about the right sport for your condition: swimming, walking, jogging or cycling... You need to exercise at least 30 minutes/day, 5 days/week.; Balance activity with rest: In addition to maintaining activity, a reasonable rest regimen is equally important for people with arthritis. Relax your body when your muscles show signs of fatigue, and only return to exercise when all your organs are ready.; Have a healthy diet: A balanced diet will help you maintain a stable weight and control inflammation. People with arthritis should limit eating refined foods, processed foods and foods of animal origin. Instead, choose foods rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties, and increase foods high in calcium and vitamin D to strengthen musculoskeletal health.; Improve sleep: Poor quality and quantity of sleep can worsen arthritis pain.
