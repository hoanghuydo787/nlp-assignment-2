    "subsection_content": "Not everyone can prevent arthritis. Some risk factors such as age, family history and gender are beyond your control. However, there are some healthy habits you can adopt to reduce your risk of developing the disease. These habits are:\nIncrease fatty fish in your diet\nFatty fish are rich in omega-3 fatty acids – a healthy polyunsaturated fat that reduces inflammation.\nA study in the journal Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases showed that women who eat fish regularly have a lower risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends that people with arthritis should eat fish high in omega-3 such as salmon, trout, mackerel, sardines... at least twice a week.\nDiets enriched with fatty fish are very beneficial in improving arthritis symptoms\nExercise regularly\nExercise not only helps reduce the stress that excess weight puts on your joints, but it also strengthens the muscles surrounding the joints. Thanks to this, they will not suffer further wear and tear.\nTo maximize the benefits of an exercise program, alternate light activities such as aerobics, walking or swimming with strengthening exercises. Besides, some stretching movements are needed to maintain flexibility and range of motion of the joints.\nWeight control\nThe knees bear most of the body's weight. If you are 4.5kg overweight, the force on your knees when you take each step will increase from 13.5 - 27kg.\nCompared to women of normal weight, overweight and obese women are nearly 4 times more likely to have knee osteoarthritis. Therefore, maintain a stable weight by following a scientific diet and regular exercise.\nAvoid injury\nOver time, the joint cartilage begins to wear down. But if you are injured while playing sports or in an accident, the process of cartilage wear will happen faster.\nTo prevent injury, you need to wear protective equipment while playing sports and learn proper exercise techniques. Use proper technique when sitting, working, and lifting heavy objects. For example, use your knees and hips instead of your back when picking up objects. If you have to sit for long periods of time, make sure your back, legs and arms are well supported.\nCenter for Joint Surgery - Sports Medicine, Tam Anh General Hospital is a reliable examination and treatment address for patients with arthritis as well as other musculoskeletal diseases. The center is equipped with modern machinery and equipment, and brings together leading experts in musculoskeletal fields. The center has implemented many specialized treatment techniques for sports injuries such as dislocations, torn knee ligaments, torn Achilles tendons, torn menisci...
