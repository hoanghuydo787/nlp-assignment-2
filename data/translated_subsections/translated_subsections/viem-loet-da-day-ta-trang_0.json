The digestive tract mucosa is the innermost membrane, which functions to produce mucus and enzymes to support the digestive process. Damage to the mucosa, mainly due to H.pylori bacteria and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), will cause ulcers leading to epigastric pain and a number of other uncomfortable symptoms. for sick people. Besides, when the mucosa is damaged, it will reduce the ability to produce mucus, creating conditions for stomach acid to destroy the tissue layer below.\nPeptic ulcer disease is a completely curable disease if detected early. However, if the disease is not treated promptly, the ulcers can progress deeper and become more numerous. Patients will be at high risk of facing dangerous complications of the disease, including: (1)\n– Pyloric stenosis – Gastric perforation – Gastrointestinal bleeding – Stomach cancer",
