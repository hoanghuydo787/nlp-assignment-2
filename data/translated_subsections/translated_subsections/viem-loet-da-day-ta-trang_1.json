However, this is not an entirely accurate view when talking about the cause of stomach ulcers.\nCurrently, there is not enough evidence to confirm that food and mental health can directly lead to duodenal ulcers. Stress, stress), as well as some hot and spicy foods can irritate and worsen the condition of duodenal ulcers, but these are not the direct agents that damage the stomach and cause complications. ulcers.\nSimilar to wine and other alcoholic beverages, although placed on the list of foods harmful to health, they are not a direct cause of peptic ulcer disease. However, people with duodenal ulcers, if they do not abstain or limit alcohol, will cause ulcers to develop, leading to the disease becoming more serious. Therefore, alcohol has the potential to significantly increase stomach damage.(2)\nLet's find out exactly what causes duodenal ulcers with the information below.\n1. Helicobacter pylori infection\nAccording to information from the American Gastroenterological Association, Helicobacter pylori infection is a main cause of peptic ulcer disease. To learn more about the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcers, Helicobacter pylori bacteria (also known as HP bacteria) is a type of bacteria that exists inside the stomach and duodenum of infected people.\nHP bacteria damage the mucosa and cause ulcers by producing an enzyme in the acidic stomach environment and corroding the mucus barrier. This leads to people infected with HP bacteria having a high chance of getting peptic ulcers as well as other gastrointestinal diseases.\n2. Use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\nUsing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain relievers is also a leading cause of duodenal ulcers.\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also known as NSAIDs, are a common type of pain reliever that patients can buy without a prescription from a doctor. However, it should be noted that this anti-inflammatory drug will increase your risk of developing gastrointestinal diseases and duodenal ulcers.\nThe American Gastroenterological Association has announced that NSAIDs cause peptic ulcers by disrupting the ability of the stomach and duodenum to protect themselves from acid inside the stomach. More dangerously, NSAIDs are also agents that hinder the ulcer healing process, negatively affecting bleeding ulcers in the stomach.\nTherefore, you should be cautious with non-steroidal pain relievers. In case you need to use medication, you should consult your doctor to prescribe the appropriate dosage.",
