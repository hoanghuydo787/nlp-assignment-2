    "subsection_content": "According to data from the US Center for Biotechnology Information, peptic ulcer disease is most common in people over the age of 60 with 68%. At this stage, the survey shows that men are more likely to get the disease than women. Meanwhile, peptic ulcers occur in people under 60 years old, accounting for 32%.\n1. People living in places with potential HP bacteria\nPeople living in places with poor sanitary conditions are at high risk of getting peptic ulcers because these are places with a high potential for infection with HP bacteria.\nBesides, doctors and nurses are also likely to be infected if the endoscopic machines are not properly sterilized and infected with HP bacteria from there.\n2. People who abuse painkillers\nNonsteroidal pain relievers are one of the two main causes of duodenal ulcers. This drug seriously impairs the self-protection ability of the stomach lining and hinders the ulcer healing process.\nAccording to the report, patients who continuously use NSAIDs will face 4% of life-threatening ulcer complications.\n3. People who use a lot of alcohol\nAlcohol is not the main cause of duodenal ulcers, but it is a dangerous factor that puts you at high risk of getting the disease. The reason is because alcohol has the ability to destroy the mucous layer that protects the mucosa, while increasing acid in the stomach, causing damage and ulcers in the stomach.\n4. People who are prone to mental stress\nPeople who are often or easily stressed will be more at risk of stomach ulcers than others. Depending on mental health, when stressed, the body will stimulate the stomach to secrete more acid. From there, this acid will have a negative impact on the stomach and duodenum.\n5. People with an unscientific diet\nUnscientific diet or irregular eating, accompanied by an unhealthy lifestyle are considered factors that disrupt the regulation of stomach acid. When acid is secreted but there is no food inside the stomach, the acid will \"attack\" the mucus, causing the mucosal layer to lose its protection, making it easily damaged by other agents.",
