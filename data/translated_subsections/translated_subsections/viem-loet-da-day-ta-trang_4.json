    "subsection_content": "Currently, for stomach ulcers, there are two diagnostic methods used: upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and a less common method, serial upper digestive x-rays.\n1. Upper digestive endoscopy method\nTo perform this method, the doctor will place a soft tube with a camera inside the patient's mouth, helping to detect and take pictures of ulcerative lesions.\nIn addition, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy can also be performed to biopsy and support treatment in case the patient has stomach bleeding.\n2. Serial upper gastrointestinal X-ray method\nThe next method used was a series of upper gastrointestinal X-rays. This is a method of diagnosing peptic ulcer disease by taking pictures of the stomach and examining the ulcer through x-ray images. In this method, the patient will be asked to drink barite contrast agent before taking the image. This barite will help doctors identify ulcers in the stomach lining and diagnose the condition. However, this method is less widely used than upper gastrointestinal endoscopy because of its poorer ability to detect lesions and cannot help with biopsy or support hemostatic treatment.(4)\nIn addition, diagnosing the cause of duodenal ulcers also includes breath testing. Compared to the two methods mentioned above, this method is simpler to perform and easier for patients to accept than performing endoscopy. The purpose of this method is for the doctor to check whether your stomach and duodenum are infected with HP bacteria by drinking a solution containing urea 15 - 30 minutes before taking a breath sample. This method is said to have accurate results and can be easily used by everyone. This method is also used as a way to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment to eradicate H.pylori bacteria in patients with duodenal ulcers after a period of treatment.",
