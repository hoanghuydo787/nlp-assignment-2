    "subsection_content": "The uvea consists of three structures: the iris, the ciliary body, and the choroid.\nIris: colored ring around the black pupil, which opens and closes to let more or less light into the eye, like a shutter in a camera.; Ciliary body: is a collection of muscles that, by contracting, allows the lens to become thicker so the eye can focus on nearby objects. When dilated, the ciliary muscle helps the lens become thinner so the eye can focus on distant objects. This process is called regulation.; Choroid: extends from the edge of the ciliary body to the optic nerve at the back of the eye. The choroid is located between the retina on the inside and the sclera on the outside. The choroid contains both pigment cells and blood vessels that nourish the inside parts of the eye, especially the retina.",
