    "subsection_content": "Causes of uveitis may be limited to the eyes or due to disorders that affect the entire body including the eyes. Most people with the disease have no identifiable cause (called idiopathic uveitis or uveitis of unknown cause).\nRed eyes due to uveitis are different from pink eye in that the edge of the black eye is also red\nMany people with uveitis have organ disorders elsewhere in the body. These include inflammatory diseases, such as Behçet syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, sarcoidosis, reactive arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis ), Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease.\nSome people have widespread infections, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, or Lyme disease.\nOther possible causes include infections that may only affect the eyes, such as herpes infections (caused by the herpes simplex virus), shingles (caused by the varicella-zoster virus), toxoplasmosis, and cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus mainly occurs in people with compromised immune systems, such as people infected with the HIV virus or people taking drugs that suppress the immune system.\nEye trauma is a common cause of anterior uveitis.\nAlthough rare, some drugs (such as pamidronate, rifabutin, sulfonamide antibiotics, cidofovir) can cause uveitis.
