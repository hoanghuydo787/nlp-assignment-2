    "subsection_content": "Initial symptoms of uveitis can be mild or severe, depending on which part of the uvea is affected.\nThe disease can cause impaired vision and abnormal dark spots\nAnterior uveitis: Severe pain in the eyes, red eyes, more pain when exposed to bright light and decreased vision are typical symptoms. The doctor may see prominent blood vessels on the surface of the eye near the edge of the cornea, cells floating in the front part of the eye (aqueous humor), and deposits on the inner surface of the cornea.\nIntermediate uveitis is usually painless. Vision may be reduced and the patient may see unusual dark spots (floaters).\nPosterior uveitis often causes vision loss and floaters. The optic nerve can become inflamed, causing vision loss, which can vary from a small blind spot to total blindness.\nPanuveitis can combine these symptoms. (3)\nUveitis can quickly damage the eye. It can cause long-term, sight-threatening complications, such as macular edema, retinal damage, glaucoma and cataracts. Many people have just one episode of uveitis, others have periodic recurrences over months to years or chronic inflammation that requires long-term treatment.",
