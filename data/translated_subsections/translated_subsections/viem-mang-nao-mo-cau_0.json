    "subsection_content": "Meningococcal meningitis is an acute respiratory infectious disease common in young children, characterized by inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain or spinal cord due to bacterial attack. The disease can occur all year round, especially when the weather starts to get cold, in winter and spring. (first)\nMeningococcal disease is divided into 4 groups: A, B, C and D. Among them, group A meningococcal disease is the most common disease group in our country.\nIn addition to the four typical disease groups above, there are also pathogenic serogroups such as W-135, X, Y and Z. Although these groups are less virulent, if the child has a weakened immune system or receives delayed treatment, , the disease can cause many serious complications for children.\nAccording to statistics, the rate of children with meningococcal disease being completely cured can be up to 95% if treated promptly. The disease can start with mild fever and change rapidly, leading to sepsis, causing the child to die within just a few hours of illness. If the disease is detected and treated late, children may face many serious lifelong consequences of the disease. The rate of children who are cured but have to live with lifelong complications of the disease is up to 20% (2). Therefore, early detection of symptoms and timely treatment of the disease are important in protecting the health and safety of children.",
