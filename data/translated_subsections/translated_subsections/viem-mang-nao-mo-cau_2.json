    "subsection_content": "Meningococcal disease is caused by the meningococcal bacteria Neisseria meningitidis, commonly known as meningococcus. This bacterial strain often appears as two cells next to each other, shaped like two coffee beans, gram (-), located in the cytoplasm of polymorphonuclear leukocytes.\nN.meningitidis bacteria are surrounded by a shell containing pathogenic toxins with an endotoxin production rate 100 times, even 1,000 times higher than other types of bacteria. Therefore, when entering the body, bacteria produce a concentrated amount of toxins, which follow the blood to the heart, affecting the ability to circulate blood and creating pressure on blood vessels throughout the body. Gradually, these blood vessels begin to hemorrhage, causing damage to the lungs, kidneys and other organs.\nAlthough the bacteria that cause meningococcal disease can only live for about 30 minutes in an outside environment with a temperature of 56 degrees Celsius and only live for 10 minutes if the temperature increases to 60 degrees. This type of bacteria can survive longer at temperatures as low as -20 degrees Celsius. Therefore, the disease is often transmitted directly from person to person and is rarely transmitted through contact with objects.\nA study shows that more than 25% of people may be infected with this bacteria but have no typical clinical manifestations, and more than 50% of people carrying meningococcal bacteria still have normal, healthy lives. This is the source of the spread of bacteria causing meningitis in children due to meningococcus, which is common in the community. Mostly, children can be infected with pathogenic bacteria through direct respiratory contact with droplets from the nose or throat of an infected person when the patient coughs, sneezes or talks.\nNeisseria meningitidis bacteria is the cause of meningococcal disease in children",
