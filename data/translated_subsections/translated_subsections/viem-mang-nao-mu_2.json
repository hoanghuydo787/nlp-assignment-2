    "subsection_content": "There are many types of bacteria that can cause purulent meningitis such as Hemophilus influenza type b (Hib), pneumococcus, meningococcus, staphylococcus and gram-negative bacteria. The incidence of each bacterial strain is related to age as well as some factors of the body's resistance. (3)\nDue to Hib bacteria: Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) bacteria is known to cause purulent meningitis in humans. This bacteria is localized in the nasopharynx and is easily transmitted from one person to another through through the respiratory tract or nasopharyngeal secretions. Since 1930, scientists have discovered two forms of Hib bacteria: encapsulated and non-encapsulated. Almost all invasive infections caused by Hib are caused by encapsulated Hib bacteria with serotype B carrying them. the highest virulence caused (H. influenzae B). This bacteria has the ability to spread quickly and cause disease in humans. When entering the body of an immune person, this shell helps Hib bacteria avoid being destroyed by white blood cells and the complement system. Meningitis caused by Hib often occurs in infants and young children from 1 to 36 months, when the child's brain is still immature and if the child has not been vaccinated and does not have antibodies. If a child is unlucky enough to be infected with Hib bacteria, it can lead to serious complications and even rapid death.; Due to E.Coli bacteria: E.coli bacteria often reside in the digestive system and can cause purulent meningitis in children, especially in infants and young children. Children with purulent meningitis caused by E.coli are often seriously ill, with sepsis causing high mortality. E.Coli bacteria are often found in fresh foods, meat and milk. Patients who are immunocompromised or are being treated with immunosuppressive drugs or people with weak resistance are often at high risk of getting the disease.; Caused by Listeria Monocytogenes bacteria: Listeria is a small aerobic, non-enveloped, acid-resistant, non-spore-forming bacterium that usually exists in the human intestine or in mammals, birds, deer and other animals. crustaceans, there are several species of listeria but Listeria Monocytogenes is the main pathogenic bacteria in humans. This bacteria is very common in the environment and has the ability to infect many foods during food processing and production, especially cold foods that do not need to be cooked before eating. This bacteria causes up to 20% of meningitis cases in children and in patients over 60 years old. Patients have symptoms of altered consciousness, cranial nerve paralysis, loss of movement or sensation...; Due to pneumococcus: Streptococcus pneumonia is considered the leading cause of purulent meningitis in countries that have vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae type b. The rate of people with pneumococcal meningitis is about 1-3/1,000 people. That means for every 1,000 people, about 1-3 people have purulent meningitis caused by pneumococcus. Pneumococcal bacteria often reside in the throat mucosa, causing sinusitis and otitis media, thereby attacking the cerebrospinal fluid and causing purulent meningitis; Due to meningococcus: Purulent meningitis caused by meningococcus usually occurs in children between 6 and 12 months old. Children over 1 year old are infected but at a lower rate. The disease is transmitted directly from person to person through droplets. People with meningococcal purulent meningitis often have characteristic signs of star-shaped purpura. The mortality rate is high, especially death within 24 hours after admission.",
