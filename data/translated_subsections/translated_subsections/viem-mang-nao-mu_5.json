    "subsection_content": "To diagnose purulent meningitis, it is necessary to rely on clinical manifestations combined with cerebrospinal fluid test results.\nClinical manifestations: Purulent meningitis has an acute progression with symptoms such as fever, often sudden high fever, lethargy, fatigue, loss of appetite and pale skin. Meningeal syndrome appears with basic signs such as vomiting, nausea, headache, constipation, possibly with signs of photophobia and lying in the trigger position. Physical signs such as stiff neck or soft neck in young children, Kernig and Brudzinsky signs, bulging, tense fontanels, lethargy, and expressionless eyes.\nSome other symptoms include convulsions, focal paralysis, septic shock or mental disorders, and the child falls into a coma. For newborns, purulent meningitis often occurs in premature babies, amniotic infections or postpartum asphyxia. In newborns, signs of infection are not obvious, children may not have a fever, many children have hypothermia, they often refuse to breastfeed, have diarrhea, lose physiological reflexes and have decreased muscle tone.\nTests to confirm the diagnosis of purulent meningitis:\nCerebrospinal fluid test: This is an important and decisive test to diagnose purulent meningitis. This test should be performed immediately when clinical examination shows signs of suspicion of the disease. If the cerebrospinal fluid is cloudy or clear like rice water, treatment is needed immediately; Blood formula: If the blood formula shows increased white blood cells, the proportion of neutrophils predominates and in infants and young children there is reduced hemoglobin concentration.; Blood and urine cultures can help identify the bacteria causing the disease.\nIn addition, there are a number of methods such as ultrasound through the fontanel or CT scan of the brain that can identify possible complications of meningitis. In addition, some CSF tests can differentiate in some cases of atypical purulent meningitis.\n>>>Reference: Is meningitis dangerous?",
