    "subsection_content": "Each type of meningitis has a different cause, but they all cause the disease in the same way: bacteria, fungi, viruses or parasites spread through the body through the bloodstream to the meninges. (3)\nSpecifically, the causes of each type are:\n1. Bacterial meningitis\nThis is an extremely dangerous disease that can be life-threatening or lead to brain damage if the patient is not treated quickly.\nSome types of bacteria that are pathogens of bacterial diseases are:\nStreptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus);; Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus);; Listeria monocytogenes (usually attacks the elderly, pregnant women, or people with immune system problems);; Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib): common cause of meningitis in children.\nBacterial meningitis begins when bacteria enter the bloodstream from a person's sinuses, ears or throat. The bacteria then travel through the bloodstream to the brain.\nThe bacteria that cause meningitis can be spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. If you or your child has been in close contact with someone who has a bacterial illness, ask your doctor what you should do to reduce your risk of getting sick.\n2. Viral meningitis\nViral meningitis is more common than bacterial meningitis and is usually less serious. However, there are some viruses that cause disease along with encephalitis, which has a more severe course and prognosis, leaving many sequelae and can cause death.\n3. Fungal meningitis\nCompared to bacterial or viral meningitis, fungal meningitis is less common. Healthy people rarely get this disease. Fungal diseases are common only in patients with weakened immune systems or disorders, such as AIDS, cancer, etc.\n4. Meningitis caused by parasites\nParasitic meningitis is a rare disease. The disease is caused by parasites that live on animals. Patients can become infected when eating food made from animals such as snails, snakes, fish, poultry (or their eggs) contaminated with parasites, etc. The risk is even higher if the food is contaminated. raw or undercooked. This disease is not transmitted from person to person.\n5. Amoebic meningitis\nChronic meningitis has symptoms similar to acute meningitis, but the disease is often long-lasting and insidious, so symptoms may not be obvious, and it may take several weeks for symptoms to appear. The cause of chronic disease is usually tuberculosis or fungus.\n6. Non-infectious meningitis\nNoninfectious meningitis is caused by diseases such as lupus erythematosus or cancer. If you have had a head injury, brain surgery, or take certain medications, you are also at risk for this condition. Non-infectious diseases are not contagious.\n7. Chronic meningitis\nChronic meningitis has similar symptoms to acute meningitis, but it takes several weeks for symptoms to appear. You will get sick if your body is infected with fungi or mycobacteria (the causative agent of tuberculosis). These organisms enter the tissue and fluid surrounding the brain to cause disease.",
