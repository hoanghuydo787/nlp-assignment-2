    "subsection_content": "Most meningitis patients will recover completely with proper treatment. However, sometimes the disease can lead to serious, life-threatening complications. Complications occur when the infection spreads to the nerves, brain, or other areas of the body. People who often experience meningitis complications are very young children or people with weak immune systems, but it can also occur in completely healthy people.\nHearing loss: Meningitis involves the nerves that control hearing, causing permanent hearing loss.; Encephalitis: Infection caused by meningitis has the potential to spread to the brain, leading to a complication called encephalitis. This is an infection of the brain, causing a series of symptoms such as fatigue, difficulty sleeping, impaired cognitive function and vision loss.; Epilepsy: When the brain is infected, it will lead to dysfunction of the nerves in the brain area - the cause of epilepsy manifested by  convulsions.; Sepsis: Sepsis is an infection that spreads in the blood. This is a serious complication of meningitis, often accompanied by rapid circulatory failure, meaning the body does not receive enough blood and oxygen, leading to organ failure and even death.; Stroke: Although this complication is uncommon, the inflammatory response of meningitis can lead to the formation of blood clots, causing a stroke.; Death: If meningitis progresses quickly, it will cause a very serious infection, leading to a dangerous condition called encephalocele, in which the brainstem (lower part of the brain) is compressed into the spinal canal. At this time, the patient may stop breathing and die if not treated promptly.\nChildren with meningitis may have their memory and concentration affected",
