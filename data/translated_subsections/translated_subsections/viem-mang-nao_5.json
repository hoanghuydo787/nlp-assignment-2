To have a diagnosis to determine whether a patient has the disease or not and what is the cause of the disease, it is necessary to do tests, especially cerebrospinal fluid tests. Cerebrospinal fluid test results also provide information for doctors in choosing medication for patients.\nOther tests may also be ordered to diagnose the disease, including:\nBlood cultures determine bacteria in the blood: Some types of bacteria such as N. meningitidis and S. pneumonia can cause sepsis and meningitis. A blood culture test will help determine whether or not the blood contains this type of bacteria; Complete blood count: helps check the number of red and white blood cells in the blood. White blood cells play a role in fighting infection. If the patient has meningitis, the white blood cell count is often elevated.; Chest X-ray: helps detect pneumonia, tuberculosis or fungal infections. The disease can occur after pneumonia.; Head CT scan: shows problems such as brain abscess or cranial pressure. Bacteria can spread from the sinuses to the meninges.\n>>>Reference: Causes and symptoms of meningitis",
