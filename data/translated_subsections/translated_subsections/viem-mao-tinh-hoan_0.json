    "subsection_content": "Epididymitis is a clinical syndrome that causes pain and swelling. The duration of illness usually lasts no more than 6 weeks. The disease is often caused by infection and the consequences of sexually transmitted diseases, usually occurring between the ages of 14 and 35 years old. The patient will have typical clinical symptoms of severe pain in the testicles. (first)\nThe epididymis is an essential component of the male reproductive system, with the function of storing and providing nutrients for sperm inside before being transported to the vas deferens. The epididymis is 5 - 6cm in size, formed by about 12 export ducts. (2)\nThe epididymis is an organ with an elongated, curled tubular structure located on the upper part of the testicles. The epididymis is divided into 3 parts: head, body and tail. In particular, the testicular tail is the part connected to the vas deferens, where mature sperm are transported to the ejaculation tube.\nSperm in the testicles is dilute because there is a large amount of fluid mixed inside the sperm. When transferred into the epididymis through the tip of the epididymis, sperm will absorb nutrients from the epididymal mucosa. This is called the process of improving sperm quality.\nThere are two types of epididymitis: acute epididymitis and chronic epididymitis. Based on the duration of the disease to be able to distinguish between acute and chronic, the duration of acute epididymitis is 6 weeks. If after 6 weeks, the patient still has no symptoms, there is a high possibility of chronic epididymitis.\nEpididymitis is a disease that, although not too dangerous at an acute level, still causes discomfort and significantly reduces the patient's quality of life because of pain in the epididymis and testicles. However, if acute orchitis is not treated promptly and develops into chronic orchitis, it will be dangerous to the patient's health and fertility.\nTherefore, as soon as patients detect unusual pain in the testicles, epididymis or other clinical signs, they need to go to the hospital for examination immediately to receive timely treatment.",
