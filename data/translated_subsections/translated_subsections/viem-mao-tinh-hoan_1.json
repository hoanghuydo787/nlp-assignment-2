    "subsection_content": "Basically, orchitis and epididymitis have the same pathogenesis, which is an inflammation and swelling that causes pain in the scrotal area. In particular, epididymitis is an inflammation of the coiled tube on the top of the testicles. Meanwhile, orchitis is an inflammatory condition that can occur anywhere in the testicles, including the epididymal duct.\nIt can be understood that epididymitis is a disease within orchitis. These two diseases can occur at the same time, when the scope of infection of the testicle spreads up to the epididymal duct.\nBecause the pathogenesis of orchitis and epididymitis is not different, the treatment for acute cases is the same, which is antibiotics, inflammation reduction, pain relief, and bed rest.",
