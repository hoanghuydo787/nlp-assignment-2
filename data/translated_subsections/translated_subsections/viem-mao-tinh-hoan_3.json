    "subsection_content": "Epididymitis is mainly caused by urinary or genital infection, and the causes of infection are very diverse. In addition, cases of non-infectious epididymitis are also quite common. Non-infectious orchitis may result from sudden trauma.\n1. Epididymitis due to infection\nInfectious epididymitis is the most common cause in cases. Infection is a condition in which harmful bacteria or viruses enter the body and damage the mucous membranes of parts of the body, including the epididymis.\nAmong them, sexually transmitted diseases STDs are the leading cause of infection in humans. The reason is because the testicles and epididymis are located close to the male genitals. When infection occurs, the epididymis is located in the proximal area, with the highest possibility of exposure to harmful microorganisms. Therefore, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are often the most common cause of epididymal inflammation due to infection.\nSpecifically, people who often get epididymitis due to infection are men under 35 years old. In particular,  E.coli bacteria, Chlamydia bacteria and bacteria that cause gonorrhea are the types of bacteria most commonly found in cases of infectious epididymitis.\nFor men 35 years of age and older, epididymitis may be the result of gram-negative enteritis. Subjects at high risk of getting the disease are men with a medical history or poor urinary health, patients who have a urinary catheter in place or have had a recent urological procedure.\nBesides, epididymitis caused by infection is also caused by other causes such as:\nAll sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) have a high risk of causing epididymitis; Urinary tract infection; Prostate infection; Mumps virus infection; Viral and tuberculosis infections. However, this case is quite rare\n2. Epididymitis is not caused by infection\nNon-infectious epididymitis often comes from reasons such as chemical irritation and secondary causes or local trauma. (3)\nSecondary causes are understood to be other urinary diseases leading to epididymitis. Some non-infectious causes of epididymitis include:\nObstruction of the urethra or urinary tract; Prostatic hypertrophy; People who have had a bladder drainage catheter installed; People with sudden injury to the groin area",
