    "subsection_content": "Epididymitis, whether acute or chronic, requires seeing a doctor as soon as symptoms of the disease are detected or the disease is suspected.\nEpididymitis is unlikely to go away on its own without treatment. More dangerously, if acute epididymitis lasts 6 weeks, it will become chronic. At this stage, the patient will have to undergo long-term treatment, more severe than intervention measures if the damage to the scrotal skin is serious.\nThis will first greatly affect the patient's spirit and quality of life. Next, the disease will also have a low cure rate. Furthermore, the disease will be a precursor to other urinary diseases, including infertility.\nTherefore, patients with epididymitis need to see a doctor as soon as clinical signs appear to be diagnosed and receive accurate treatment instructions from the doctor.",
