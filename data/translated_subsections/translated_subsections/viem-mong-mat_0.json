    "subsection_content": "Ciliary iridocyclitis is an inflammation of the anterior part of the uvea (iris), also known as anterior uveitis. The disease is most common in the form of uveitis. [first]\nSpecifically, the uvea is the layer between the retina and the white of the eye. The uvea is composed of the iris in front, the ciliary body in the middle, and the choroid in the back. The iris is located in the front part of the uvea, a pigmented membrane that determines human eye color. The cause of iritis is often unknown.\nIritis of the ciliary body is divided into 2 types:\nAcute (disease progression in less than 3 months); Chronic (illness lasting more than 3 months)\nThe treatment of iritis in general and iridocyclitis in particular needs to evaluate the inflammation location, duration, and accompanying symptoms. A thorough examination of eye indicators will help the doctor narrow down the cause of iridocyclitis.",
