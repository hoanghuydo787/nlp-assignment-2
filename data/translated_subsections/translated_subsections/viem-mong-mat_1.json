    "subsection_content": "Iritis generally accounts for 10% (3000) of the 30,000 annual cases of blindness seen in the United States [2]. Often, the cause of iridocyclitis cannot be determined. In some cases, iritis may be related to eye injury, genetic factors, or some other disease. Potential causes of iritis include:\nEye injury: mild trauma, non-penetrating trauma, chemical or temperature burns can also cause acute iritis.; Infection: some parts of the face infected with viruses such as ulcers, shingles caused by herpes virus... can cause iritis.; Other infectious diseases caused by viruses and bacteria may also be associated with uveitis. For example, toxoplasmosis is caused by eating raw or undercooked food, lung infection is caused by inhaling fungal spores, tuberculosis, syphilis...; Genetics: people with some autoimmune diseases have inherited genes that affect the immune system, making them susceptible to acute iritis. Some diseases that affect the gene that causes iritis include: ankylosing spondylitis, arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis.; Behcet's disease: chronic vascular damage, damage to many organs combined with mucositis. Recurrent disease of unknown cause, characterized by mouth and genital ulcers, eye inflammation and skin lesions. Patients with Behcet's disease often present with anterior uveitis or posterior uveitis.; Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: chronic iritis may develop in children with rheumatoid arthritis.; Sarcoidosis (full name Sarcoidosis): is an autoimmune disease that involves the development of inflammatory cells in areas of the body including the eyes. This is a multisystem disease of unknown origin, with characteristic signs of granulomatous inflammation. The disease affects the lungs, 50% of sarcoidosis patients affect the eyes.; Lupus erythematosus: is an autoimmune disease, characterized by the production of substances from antibodies against cell nuclei. Lupus erythematosus is often associated with scleritis, scleritis, lupus retinopathy, and chorioretinopathy. Iritis rarely occurs alone in people with lupus erythematosus, often associated with posterior uveitis.; Medications: some medications such as the antibiotic rifabutin and the antiviral drug cidofovir can be a rare cause of iritis. Stop using these medications if iritis occurs.\nTo effectively treat iritis, it is necessary to understand the immune-inflammatory cascade. There are 2 main causes of inflammatory response [3]:\nInnate immune system; Adaptive immune system.\nThe innate immune system uses macrophages, mast cells and neutrophils to destroy invading bacteria, it can immediately recognize some foreign bacteria, viruses and antigens to fight back without No history of previous antigen exposure is required.\nNormal eyes and eyes with iridocyclitis.\nMeanwhile, the adaptive immune system (including B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes and macrophages) can only respond to previously encountered antigens. Repeated exposure to an antigen leads to increased immune responses, enhancing long-term immune protection against foreign antigens.",
