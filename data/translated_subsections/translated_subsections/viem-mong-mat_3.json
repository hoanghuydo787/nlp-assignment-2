    "subsection_content": "Iritis, if not treated properly, can lead to the following complications:\nCataracts: long-term iritis can cause cataracts. Scratched iritis causes scarring, causing the iris to stick to the lens below the cornea, causing the pupil to have an abnormal shape and react slowly to light.; Glaucoma: recurrent iritis leads to glaucoma and possible loss of vision.; Calcium in the eye: causes corneal degeneration and reduces vision; Retinal detachment: iritis causes fluid to develop in the retina, which can blur or reduce central and macular vision.\nSome cases of iridocyclitis tend to recur. Early treatment can shorten treatment time and reduce complications.",
