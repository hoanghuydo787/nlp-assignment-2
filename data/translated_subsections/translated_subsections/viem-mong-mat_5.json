Normally, iritis will be treated as follows:\nEye drops to reduce inflammation.; Mydriatic eye drops help reduce pain caused by iritis. Mydriatic eye drops also protect you from symptoms that affect the function of your pupils.\nIf the symptoms of the disease do not improve and become more severe, the ophthalmologist will prescribe another oral anti-inflammatory medication. Depending on the patient's condition, the doctor will prescribe an appropriate treatment regimen.\nPatients treated with corticosteroids are usually scheduled for a follow-up visit after 1 week. During the second visit, the number of anterior chamber cells must decrease by half compared to the previous visit. If the number of inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber does not decrease, suspect the patient is not using the drops properly or has iridocyclitis caused by another infectious disease. Therefore, during medical examination and treatment at home, patients need to follow the doctor's instructions exactly.\nMaster Doctor Pham Huy Vu Tung is examining a patient's eyes.",
