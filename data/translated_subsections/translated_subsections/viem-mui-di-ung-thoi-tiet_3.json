Clinical diagnosis\nDiagnosis of allergic rhinitis is usually made clinically based on characteristic symptoms and good response to treatment with antihistamines or nasal corticosteroids. According to Dr. Thuy Hang, diagnosing the disease will be easier if the patient has seasonal symptoms, or clearly identifies a trigger or has more than one irritant, including allergens. and stimulants.\nTherefore, patients need:\nRecall where and what you were doing before rhinitis symptoms began. For example, you spent time walking in the garden or playing with your pet. Note the time of year when symptoms of allergic rhinitis often appear.
