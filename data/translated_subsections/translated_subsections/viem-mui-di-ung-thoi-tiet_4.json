    "subsection_content": "Seasonal allergic rhinitis can be treated with the following methods:\n1. Medicine to treat seasonal allergic rhinitis\nAccording to Dr. Thuy Hang, drug treatment options usually include H1 antihistamines, nasal corticosteroids and leukotriene receptor antagonists. These three drugs are not only specific for seasonal allergic rhinitis but also for perennial allergic rhinitis.(3)\nOral antihistamines usually work quickly, so whenever symptoms appear, the patient can take them immediately.\n*Dr. Thuy Hang noted that the effect of antihistamines on symptoms, especially nasal congestion, is quite modest, so treatment results will be better if combined with decongestants. However, patients need to use combination drugs as prescribed by the doctor because they can cause some side effects such as drug-induced rhinitis or reduced effectiveness when treatment reaches the 3rd day. Patients should only use these drugs. This medication is for short periods of time and should not be used for a long time to avoid the risk of drug resistance.\nIntranasal corticosteroids: Considered the most effective medication for seasonal allergic rhinitis. Not only for nasal symptoms but also for eye allergy symptoms, intranasal glucocorticoids are as effective as oral antihistamines. Leukotriene receptor antagonists: The effects of leukotriene receptor antagonists on symptoms of allergic rhinitis are similar or slightly less than those of oral antihistamines. Injectable: This is also a subcutaneous immunotherapy that helps treat seasonal allergic rhinitis. However, Dr. Thuy Hang recommends that this therapy has the risk of causing systemic reactions, occurring in 0.1% of injections. In rare cases, it can lead to life-threatening anaphylactic shock.; Intranasal corticosteroids: Considered the most effective medication for seasonal allergic rhinitis.

Notes when treating seasonal allergic rhinitis at home\nIn addition to medical treatment as prescribed by the doctor, patients can combine some of the following home remedies for seasonal allergic rhinitis to improve symptoms.\nRinsing the nose with physiological saline: This method helps remove allergens from the nose, especially useful for treating symptoms of runny nose, sneezing, dry nose and stuffy nose. Rinsing the nose with salt water also helps clean the nasal mucosa. Patients can use it before using spray medication for better effectiveness.
