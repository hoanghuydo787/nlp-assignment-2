Chronic rhinitis due to allergies\nIn allergic rhinitis, symptoms often occur as a result of the body's reaction to an allergen. The most common allergens include seasonal pollen, perennial indoor allergens, such as dust mites, pet dander, and some types of mold. Other allergens may include certain workplace irritants such as chalk dust and coal dust.\nIn addition, in young children, food allergies can also cause symptoms of chronic rhinitis including sneezing, runny nose, stuffy nose, and itchy nose and throat. In this case, nasal mucus is often clear and thin.\n2. Chronic non-allergic rhinitis\nChronic non-allergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis is associated with changes in the nervous system that controls blood vessels in the nose. Overactive nerves in the nose will irritate the nasal mucosa causing symptoms of congestion, runny nose and postnasal drip. Therefore, the patient will be more sensitive to various factors including changes in humidity or exposure to chemicals.(3)",
