    "subsection_content": "The diagnosis of chronic rhinitis is largely based on clinical symptoms. An ENT doctor may order a sinus X-ray or CT scan to see if the patient has a sinus infection. In addition, the doctor may also prescribe additional skin allergy testing and blood tests to determine whether certain allergens are the cause of allergic rhinitis.(1)\nAccording to MSc. Nguyen Trung Nguyen, if a patient only has symptoms at certain times of the year, it is likely that the patient has allergic rhinitis. Besides, if the allergen is animal fur or indoor dust and the patient has symptoms year-round, it will be determined to have chronic allergic rhinitis.\nPeople with non-allergic rhinitis will not respond to allergy treatments and allergy testing will come back negative. Unlike allergic rhinitis, non-allergic rhinitis does not involve the immune system and rarely causes itching in the nose, eyes or throat like allergies do.\nIn a small number of cases of chronic rhinitis, especially those with intellectual disabilities, vegetative states or long-term comas, and young children who are not well cared for, their noses may contain fly larvae inside the nose. . This disease is common in livestock such as sheep, goats, and cows, but sometimes also occurs in humans. When flies lay eggs around the nostrils, the eggs will hatch into larvae. They move throughout the nasal cavity and sinuses feeding on mucus and debris. At this time, the patient will feel ticklish, have an itchy nose and sneeze a lot. Sneezing is the body's reflex to push foreign objects out of the airway.\nDifferential diagnosis\n1. Foreign body\nThe doctor needs to evaluate for foreign objects in the nose if the patient is a child and has symptoms of chronic nasal congestion on one side frequently, with or without foul-smelling secretions and pus. Foreign objects can be a bean, a grain of rice, a piece of a toy or a small battery lodged deep in the nose and cannot always be detected with the naked eye.\n2. Nasal cavity cancer\nNasal cancer is very rare, accounting for 3% of all head and neck cancers, with an incidence of 1 case per 100,000 people. If an elderly person has symptoms of blockage on one side of the nose and gradual onset of bleeding, nasal cancer should be suspected.\n3. Abnormalities in the anatomy of the nose and pharynx\nCertain anatomic abnormalities of the nose and pharynx can cause chronic symptoms of nasal obstruction without other obvious symptoms.\nAbnormalities include:\nConcha bullosa (airy turbinates): The turbinates are a structure formed from bones inside the nose, helping to control the flow of air into the nose, while also cleaning and warming the air before entering the lungs. If one of the nasal turbinates has air sacs that cause enlargement, it will lead to symptoms of blockage on one or both sides of the nose.; Concha bullosa (airy turbinates): The turbinates are a structure formed from bones inside the nose, helping to control the flow of air into the nose, while also cleaning and warming the air before entering the lungs. If one of the nasal turbinates has air sacs that cause enlargement, it will lead to symptoms of blockage on one or both sides of the nose.\nDeviated nasal septum: Deviated nasal septum narrows the airways and can cause nasal symptoms such as stuffy nose, sore nose, runny nose.; Deviated nasal septum: Deviated nasal septum narrows the airways and can cause nasal symptoms such as stuffy nose, sore nose, and runny nose.\nAdenoid tissue hypertrophy: A condition in which adenoid tissue in the nasal dome grows beyond normal, causing symptoms of rhinosinusitis such as stuffy nose, runny nose.; Adenoid tissue hypertrophy: A condition in which the adenoid tissue in the nasal dome grows beyond normal, causing symptoms of rhinosinusitis such as stuffy nose and runny nose.\nDeviated nasal septum also causes chronic rhinitis",
