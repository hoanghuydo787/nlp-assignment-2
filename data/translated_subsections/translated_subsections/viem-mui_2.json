    "subsection_content": "Rhinitis is divided into two main types: allergic rhinitis and non-allergic rhinitis.\n1. Allergic rhinitis\nAllergic rhinitis is the most common form of rhinitis\nAllergic rhinitis occurs when the body's immune system detects and responds to agents (called allergens) from the environment. These agents are harmless to most people (such as dust, mold, pollen, animal dander, perfume, etc.), but if the patient is allergic to them, the body will react as if they were harmful.\nWhen exposed to allergens, the patient's immune system will produce antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE). This releases chemicals involved in the inflammatory response, including histamine, leading to the uncomfortable symptoms of allergic rhinitis.\n2. Non-allergic rhinitis\nUnlike allergic rhinitis, non-allergic rhinitis is not triggered by allergens and does not involve an immune system response. It is divided into many smaller types depending on the cause of the disease, the most common are:\n3. Viral rhinitis\nThis type of rhinitis occurs due to invasion and attack from viruses, such as cold viruses or flu viruses. Inflammation stimulates mucus production, causing sneezing, runny nose and many other symptoms.\n4. Vasomotor rhinitis\nVasomotor rhinitis is a condition in which the blood vessels in the nose become overly sensitive due to an imbalance in the nervous system that controls the nasal mucosa. When blood vessels are too sensitive, certain environmental factors can cause them to dilate, leading to increased mucus secretion and congestion.\nIrritants can include chemical irritants, perfumes, cigarette smoke, changes in temperature, humidity, drinking too much alcohol, spicy foods, stress, etc.\n5. Atrophic rhinitis\nAtrophic rhinitis is a chronic disease that occurs when the nasal mucosa atrophies and hardens, causing the nasal cavity to expand, become dry and crusty. The proliferation of microorganisms also causes unpleasant odors, but often the patient does not smell it because the sense of smell is also reduced or lost due to mucosal atrophy.\n6. Drug-induced rhinitis\nDrug-induced rhinitis often occurs when there is overuse of over-the-counter decongestants (nasal sprays or drops). At this time, instead of reducing nasal and sinus symptoms, the decongestant will irritate the nasal mucosa and lead to rhinitis.",
