Because the symptoms of some types of rhinitis are relatively similar, to determine whether the disease is related to allergies or not, the doctor may ask the patient to conduct an allergy test with a blood test or skin test. .\nA CT scan can also be used to confirm the diagnosis and examine changes in the nasal cavity. A CT scan or nasal endoscopy can also rule out sinusitis.\nIn the case of drug-induced rhinitis, the doctor will ask the patient about the use of decongestants as well as other medications.",
