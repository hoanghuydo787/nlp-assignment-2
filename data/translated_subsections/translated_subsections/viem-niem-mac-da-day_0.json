    "subsection_content": "Gastritis is an inflammation, irritation, and erosion of the stomach lining (stomach) that occurs because the protective layer (mucosa) is damaged and weakened. The main cause is bacterial infection, painkiller abuse or some other related factors. The disease can occur suddenly or appear gradually over time. Most of the time, this condition can improve quickly with appropriate treatment. However, in some cases, inflammation can also develop into ulcers and increase the risk of stomach cancer.\n1. Acute gastric mucosal inflammation\nThis is a condition in which the stomach lining suddenly becomes inflamed or swollen, causing severe pain and discomfort. The disease can appear due to injury, stress, consumption of stimulants, NSAIDs, steroids, spicy foods, or under the influence of bacteria or viruses. However, most pain only appears temporarily and lasts for short periods at a certain time.(1)\n2. Chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa\nThis is a persistent but low-level inflammation and damage to the stomach lining. At this time, the stomach lining gradually becomes thinner because cells are destroyed by the immune response mechanism, including Lymphocytes. When the chronic condition lasts continuously for many years, inflammation will progress to the stage of mucosal atrophy, metaplasia and dysplasia with an increased risk of stomach cancer.",
