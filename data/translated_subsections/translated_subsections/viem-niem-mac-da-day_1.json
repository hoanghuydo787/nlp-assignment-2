    "subsection_content": "Gastric mucosal inflammation occurs because the protective barrier of the stomach wall is weakened or damaged by digestive juices. Specifically, some main causes include: (2)\n1. Bacterial infection\nHelicobacter pylori (H.p) infection is one of the most common infections in the world, affecting about 50-70% of the population. However, only a small number of cases develop gastritis or other digestive disorders. Diseases stemming from this group of causes can be genetic or influenced by living and eating habits.\n2. Regularly use pain relievers\nPain relievers or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) can cause acute and chronic gastritis. Caused by excessive or frequent use will reduce the protective ability of the mucosal layer.\n3. Age\nOlder people often face a higher risk of gastric mucosal inflammation than younger people. The reason is that at this stage, the possibility of being attacked by Helicobacter Pylori and autoimmune disorders also increases. From there, the erosion process also becomes faster.\n4. Alcohol abuse\nAlcohol can irritate and corrode the stomach lining, making the organ vulnerable to digestive juices. Therefore, abuse of this type of stimulant is one of the common causes of acute gastritis.\n5. Stress\nPsychological instability can also cause inflammation of the stomach lining. In particular, severe stress after injury, infection, surgery... can easily cause the disease to progress quickly and become complicated.\n6. Cancer treatment\nMany cancer patients have to regularly face gastritis. The cause mostly comes from the chemotherapy or radiotherapy drugs being used.\n7. Autoimmune gastritis\nThis is a condition in which the body attacks the cells in the stomach lining. This reaction accidentally causes the stomach's protective barrier to be eroded. This condition often appears commonly in people suffering from other autoimmune disorders such as Hashimoto's, type 1 diabetes... In addition, Vitamin B12 deficiency in the body can also be the cause of gastritis. autoimmune.",
