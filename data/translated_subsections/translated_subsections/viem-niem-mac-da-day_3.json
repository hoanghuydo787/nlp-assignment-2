    "subsection_content": "Gastric mucosal inflammation can be improved quickly if detected and treated promptly. In the opposite case, the patient is at risk of facing many dangerous complications. Specifically includes:\n1. Peptic ulcer disease\nLong-term inflammation of the stomach lining can cause ulcers to appear, causing pain in the epigastric area. This is also the cause of the body's reduced ability to absorb Vitamin B12, leading to anemia.\n2. Stomach bleeding\nStomach ulcers have the risk of puncturing blood vessels, leading to dangerous bleeding. In the long term, the body will face severe anemia due to its inability to produce healthy red blood cells.\n3. Gastric perforation\nWhen the mucosa is damaged, the ulcers will become severe and spread deeply through the stomach wall, causing gastric perforation. This can cause fluid to overflow into the abdomen and spread bacteria, causing peritonitis. In addition, sepsis also has a high risk of appearing and spreading, even leading to death.\n4. Pyloric stenosis\nThis is a condition in which fibrotic tissue develops, causing a narrowing of the intestinal lumen just below the stomach. From there, the movement of food through the digestive tract is hindered.\n5. Stomach cancer\nIf not treated promptly, mucositis can cause stomach cancer cells to grow out of control. This is considered the most dangerous complication, posing a direct threat to the patient's life.",
