When the amount of this natural bacteria changes after an injury or certain condition, it can cause endometritis.\nIn addition, women are at risk of infection after miscarriage or childbirth, especially after labor and cesarean section. Medical procedures that involve the uterus also increase the risk of endometritis, including:\nHysteroscopy.; Cervical dilation, uterine curettage, uterine control.; Insert an intrauterine device (IUD).\nEndometritis can occur simultaneously, at the same time as other pelvic diseases such as cervicitis.
