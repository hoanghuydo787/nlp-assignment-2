    "subsection_content": "“Can you get pregnant with endometritis?” is a common question of many women when diagnosed with this disease. Dr. Manh Tung said, whether endometritis can lead to pregnancy or not depends on many factors. However, pregnancy is possible in most cases after treatment, except:\nIf women do not subjectively treat it early, the disease will progress seriously, causing widespread inflammation and the risk of dangerous complications, including endometrial cancer and secondary infertility.\nIn case the condition does not respond to medical treatment, the doctor is forced to prescribe surgical treatment to avoid the condition from getting worse and endangering life. Surgical treatment with uterine curettage helps treat the disease effectively, but can also cause women to lose the ability to get pregnant naturally.",
