    "subsection_content": "Depending on each specific case, chronic bronchitis symptoms, frequency and severity may vary. Typically, chronic bronchitis includes characteristic symptoms such as:\nPersistent cough; Gob; Difficulty breathing, wheezing.\nSpecifically, mucus is often green, yellow, or white. Over time, this amount of mucus will gradually increase due to mucus production in the lungs and accumulate in the bronchial tubes, restricting airflow. This causes difficulty breathing, which can be accompanied by wheezing in people with chronic bronchitis. This symptom will become more serious if not treated promptly.\nIn addition, there are other signs of chronic bronchitis such as: fatigue, chills, fever, chest tightness, sinus congestion or bad breath. Due to lack of oxygen in the blood, the skin and lips of later-stage patients are often pale and pale. Some cases can also lead to peripheral edema, swelling in the legs and ankles. (2)",
