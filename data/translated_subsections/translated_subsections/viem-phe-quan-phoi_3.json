    "subsection_content": "Symptoms of bronchopneumonia are similar to other respiratory diseases. Therefore, many patients are still subjective, thinking they just have the flu or a normal cold.\nHowever, if the above signs of the disease become more and more serious, you should go to the hospital for an accurate examination. At this time, doctors may perform some imaging methods or tests to see if you have bronchopneumonia.\nTechniques commonly applied in diagnosing bronchopneumonia include:\n1. Take X-rays\nA chest X-ray can show inflammation or air buildup around the lungs (pneumothorax). (4)\n2. Chest CT scan\nAnother imaging diagnostic method that is also often indicated in diagnosing and \"catching\" bronchopneumonia is CT scan. Through CT scan images of the patient's lungs, doctors can evaluate in detail the damaged lung tissues.\nDiagnostic imaging indications such as X-ray, CT... can help diagnose bronchopneumonia\n3. Blood test\nBronchopneumonia can be detected through blood tests. Accordingly, after testing the patient's blood, the doctor will see if the total number of white blood cells increases or decreases abnormally, thereby concluding whether the patient has a bacterial infection or not.\n4. Bronchoscopy\nBronchoscopy helps check the airways as well as the condition of the lungs as well as other respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, chronic pneumonia, bronchial warts, etc.\n5. Sputum culture\nThis testing method can help detect whether a patient's sputum is infected or not, thereby determining bronchopneumonia.\n6. Pulse oximetry\nThis is a simple, non-invasive testing technique that measures the percentage of oxygen in the blood stream. If the pulse oximetry result is lower, it means the lower your oxygen level, the more damaged your lungs are.\n7. Arterial blood gases\nIf pulse oximetry helps calculate the amount of oxygen flowing in the blood, arterial blood gas can assist in determining the oxygen concentration in a patient's blood.",
