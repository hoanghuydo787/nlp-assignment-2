    "subsection_content": "Do not be subjective with bronchopneumonia because delay in diagnosis and treatment can lead to dangerous complications, such as:\n1. Respiratory failure\nWith bronchopneumonia, the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide is impaired, causing respiratory failure and difficulty breathing. The patient may have to use a ventilator to breathe.\n2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome\nMore serious than respiratory failure is acute respiratory failure. This complication can threaten the patient's life if not treated.\n3. Sepsis\nSepsis, also known as blood infection, is a complication of bronchopneumonia due to inflammation and infection that causes an immune response, causing damage to organs and tissues in the body.\nIf people with bronchitis have sepsis, it can lead to multiple organ failure and a high risk of death.\n4. Lung abscess\nWhen bronchopneumonia becomes severe, it can cause pockets of pus-filled fluid to overflow into the lungs, called lung abscesses.\n5. Other complications\nBronchopneumonia can also lead to kidney failure, heart failure, irregular heartbeat, etc.",
