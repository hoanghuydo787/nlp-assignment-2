    "subsection_content": "The cause of this pneumonia is the invasion of Metapneumovirus  (Human Metapneumovirus- hMPV).\nMetapneumovirus is a new virus belonging to the Paramyxovirus family discovered in 2001 by scientists in the Netherlands, with many similar epidemiological characteristics to RSV, the respiratory syncytial virus that often causes illness in winter and spring in Vietnam. .\nMetapneumovirus is transmitted from person to person mainly by direct contact with droplets containing the disease-causing virus in the air released by the patient from the body when communicating, coughing, sneezing, etc. In rare cases, patients become infected by contact with surfaces containing disease-causing viruses such as door handles, toys, personal items, etc.\nThis strain of virus can cause acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in all ages. When infected with the virus, the patient develops upper respiratory symptoms such as frequent coughing, difficulty breathing, and fever. The disease then progresses with signs of coughing a lot, feeling short of breath, wheezing, and in some more severe cases there are signs of lung damage on X-ray, pneumonia or bronchiolitis.\nAccording to medical experts, Metapneumovirus is less common and usually does not cause severe symptoms. However, in the North of our country, during the transition period of winter and early spring, the weather changes erratically, with high humidity in the air creating conditions for viruses and bacteria that cause respiratory diseases such as RSV, pneumococcus, and influenza. , Hib, Metapneumovirus... thrive, thereby increasing the number of cases. (2)\nWhen co-infected with Metapneumovirus with other bacteria and viruses, the risk of the disease progressing seriously and causing complications increases. In addition, the increase in the number of severe cases due to Metapneumovirus is caused by \"immune debt\" after social distancing and reduced contact during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
