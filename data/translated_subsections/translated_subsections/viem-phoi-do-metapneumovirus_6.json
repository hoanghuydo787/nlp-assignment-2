    "subsection_content": "Pneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus, if not treated properly, can prolong the disease leading to bacterial co-infection, causing many dangerous complications such as:\nSepsis: occurs when bacteria enter the bloodstream from the lungs, spreading to other organs. This condition can cause organ failure if not detected and treated early.; Respiratory failure: often occurs when the patient has severe pneumonia. The patient needs mechanical ventilation support until the lungs heal.; Pleural effusion: occurs when fluid accumulates inside the space between the tissue lining the lungs and the chest cavity, causing difficulty breathing. When experiencing this complication, the patient may need emergency aspiration or drainage.; Lung abscess: occurs when pus forms in a cavity of the lung. Depending on the severity of complications, patients with lung abscesses may be treated with antibiotics, surgery, or drainage with a needle or long tube.\nFor more information about care and health issues, you can contact the Department of Pediatrics, Tam Anh General Hospital at:\nMost cases of pneumonia caused by Metapneumovirus are mild. However, we should not be subjective because the disease can get worse and leave many serious health consequences if not treated properly.",
