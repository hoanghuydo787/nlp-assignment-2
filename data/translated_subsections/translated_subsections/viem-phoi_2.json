    "subsection_content": "3.1. Bacterial pneumonia\nBacteria are the cause of most cases of community-acquired pneumonia in adults. Bacterial pneumonia is often transmitted through droplets (when healthy people inhale or swallow droplets filled with bacteria after an infected person coughs or sneezes). People with weakened immune systems and people with chronic underlying diseases are more susceptible to bacterial pneumonia than normal people.\nPneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria\n3.2. Pneumonia caused by viral infection\nCurrently, the most dangerous viral pneumonia is the SARS-CoV-2 virus. As of September 4, 2021, pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has attacked the world, infecting 220 million people, of whom over 4.56 million died. In addition, pneumonia can be caused by many other viruses that cause colds and flu. (3)\nPatients with severe pneumonia caused by Corona virus attack\n3.3. Fungal pneumonia\nThis type of pneumonia is caused by inhaling fungal spores and is common in people with chronic health problems or weakened immune systems. Fungal pneumonia develops very quickly, when inhaled fungal spores stick to the lungs. People who smoke and live in dusty, moldy environments are susceptible to fungal pneumonia.\n3.4. Chemical pneumonia\nChemical pneumonia is also known as aspiration pneumonia. This is a very rare, but highly dangerous pneumonia. Chemical pneumonia occurs in many different degrees. The severity of the condition will depend on: type of chemical, duration of exposure, patient's condition, first aid measures taken... In addition, chemicals that cause pneumonia can also harm many people. other agencies.\n3.5. Hospital pneumonia\nPneumonia that occurs 48 hours after admission to the hospital without the patient having had symptoms of pneumonia before. Hospital-acquired pneumonia is often caused by bacteria such as P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp, Enterobacteriacae, Haemophillus spp, S. aureus, Streptococcus spp.\n3.6. Community-acquired pneumonia\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia refers to all types of pneumonia that are not hospital-acquired pneumonia. The causes of community-acquired pneumonia are very diverse, the most common are bacterial and viral pneumonia.",
