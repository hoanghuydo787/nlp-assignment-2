    "subsection_content": "4.1. Children\nChildren under 5 years old, especially those under 2 months old, are the age group at highest risk of contracting and dying from pneumonia. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), each year about 150 million episodes of pneumonia occur in children in developing countries, of which about 11 million are hospitalized. Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of death in children under 5 years old. This organization also estimates that every day about 4,300 children die from pneumonia worldwide. In Vietnam alone, each year about 2.9 million children get pneumonia and about 4,000 children die from pneumonia.\n4.2. Pregnant women\nDuring pregnancy, women's immune system weakens, making them vulnerable to viruses and bacteria. Therefore, pregnant women are susceptible to pneumonia. Pneumonia during pregnancy can seriously affect the health of the pregnant woman and the fetus. The disease will increase the risk of pregnancy complications, premature birth, and can cause miscarriage. In particular, normal people with mild pneumonia can be treated at home, and the disease can be cured in about 2 to 3 weeks. For pregnant women, if suspected of having pneumonia, they should immediately seek medical attention and receive treatment as prescribed by a doctor to avoid affecting the fetus.\n4.3. Elder\nOlder people have weak health and poor adaptability, so during the rainy and sunny seasons, they are susceptible to respiratory diseases, including pneumonia. Elderly people with pneumonia if not treated promptly will lead to many complications, typically respiratory failure.\n4.4. Other risk factors\nHospital patients are at higher risk of pneumonia if you are in a hospital intensive care unit, especially if you are on a breathing machine (ventilator).\nPeople with chronic illnesses are more likely to get pneumonia if they have asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or heart disease.\nSmoking damages the body's natural defense system against bacteria and viruses that cause pneumonia.\nWeakened or suppressed immune systems such as those with HIV/AIDS, who have had an organ transplant, or who receive chemotherapy or long-term steroids are at risk of developing pneumonia.(4)",
