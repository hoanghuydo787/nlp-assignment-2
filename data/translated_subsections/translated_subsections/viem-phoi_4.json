The doctor will base on the medical condition and prescribe laboratory tests for the patient to perform tests to diagnose and find the cause of pneumonia.\n5.1. Clinical examination\nThe doctor will ask your medical history to look for signs of cough, difficulty breathing, fever and other accompanying symptoms.
