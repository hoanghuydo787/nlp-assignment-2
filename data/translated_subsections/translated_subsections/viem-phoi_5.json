    "subsection_content": "Even with treatment, some people with pneumonia, especially those in high-risk groups, may experience complications, including:\n6.1. Sepsis\nBacteria that enter the bloodstream from the lungs can spread infection to other organs, potentially causing organ failure.\n6.2. Respiratory failure\nIf your pneumonia is severe or you have chronic lung diseases, you may have difficulty breathing and need oxygen. You may need to be hospitalized and use a ventilator (ventilator) until your lungs heal.\n6.3. Pleural effusion\nPneumonia can cause fluid to build up in the thin space between the layers of tissue lining the lungs and the chest cavity (pleura). If the amount of fluid in the pleural space increases and causes difficulty breathing, you may need to have the fluid drained or drained.\n6.4. Lung abscess\nAn abscess occurs if pus forms in a cavity in the lung. Abscesses are usually treated with antibiotics. Sometimes, surgery or drainage with a needle or long tube placed into the abscess is necessary to remove the pus.",
