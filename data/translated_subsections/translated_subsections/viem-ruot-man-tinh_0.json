The pathogenesis of chronic enteritis is still unknown. However, interactions between environmental factors, the body's immune factors, the patient's microbiome, and genetics play an important role. In recent years, people have noted abnormalities in the intestinal microflora in Crohn's disease, with an increase in some pathogenic bacteria strains such as E.Coli, proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and a decrease in Firmicutes and Bacteroides strains.
