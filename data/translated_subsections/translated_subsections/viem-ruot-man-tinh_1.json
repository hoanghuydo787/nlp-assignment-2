The most common age for Crohn's disease is between 20 and 30 years old, and the second age group is usually after 60 years old.\nSmoking increases the risk of Crohn's disease and increases complications of strictures, fistulas, and the need for surgery. A diet high in fiber and fruit reduces the risk of Crohn's disease, while eating a lot of animal fat or unsaturated fatty acids increases the risk of Crohn's disease. Vitamin D deficiency is common in Crohn's disease.(1)\nCurrently, the incidence of IBD is tending to increase in the Asian population, the overall incidence varies from 1 to 16/100,000 people. In Asia, 36% of cases were diagnosed after complications of intestinal stricture or perforation compared to only 5% in Australia.",
