Up to 40% of CROHN patients have perianal manifestations such as excess skin folds, prolapsed hemorrhoids, and anal fistula. 35% may have fistulas between the digestive tract and organs in the body (bladder and vaginal fistulas) or leak into the skin, abdomen, or retroperitoneal space.(3)\nIn children, the disease often causes slow growth and delayed puberty.
