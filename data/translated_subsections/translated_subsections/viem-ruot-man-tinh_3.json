The doctor needs to combine clinical examination, colonoscopy, computed tomography or MRI and histological results from endoscopic biopsy. In addition, increased inflammatory markers in the blood such as CRP and calprotectin in the blood are also a sign that helps point to the disease. It is necessary to differentiate chronic colitis from acute inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal tuberculosis or irritable bowel syndrome.",
