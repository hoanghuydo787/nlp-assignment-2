    "subsection_content": "Treatment of IBD is challenging and complex. IBD is a progressive, relapsing disease. Particularly for Crohn's disease, more than 80% of cases require hospitalization. More than 50% of cases require intestinal resection surgery within the first 10 years of disease detection.\nCurrently, there is still no evidence of clinical cure. The risk of colon cancer also increases after 8-10 years of disease. This risk is 6 times greater than that of people without IBD.\nRegarding treatment, it is necessary to identify risk factors, evaluate clinical and endoscopic transcripts to group mild or severe forms to help guide treatment and patient prognosis. High-risk patients are diagnosed at a young age (<30 years old), are current smokers, have increased CRP and/or increased fecal Calprotectin.\nCalprotectin >100 ug/gr indicates the possibility of endoscopic recurrence with a sensitivity of 89%; >160 ug/gr predicts recurrence when patients are in clinical regression while on anti-TNF treatment with a sensitivity of 91.7% and specificity of 83%; ≥350 ug/gr helps predict relapse in stable Crohn's disease patients who have stopped anti-TNF.\nOn the other hand, deep or long ulcers on endoscopy, presence of perianal pathology, extra-gastrointestinal manifestations such as lesions in the skin, joints, iris, history of bowel surgery, corticosteroid dependence or corticosteroid resistance are factors. poor prognostic factor for the disease. Smoking increases disease activity and increases the relapse rate after stopping anti-TNF. Therefore, stopping smoking is very important.\nNSAIDs have been associated with disease onset and should be avoided in patients with IBD. Anxiety, stress, and depression affect quality of life and hinder treatment compliance. Therefore, physicians need to fully assess anxiety and neuropsychiatric disorders in the care and management of this patient group.\nTreatment of chronic enteritis, specifically:\nIn mild cases, doctors may only be able to use topical corticosteroids or Sulfasalazine to control symptoms.; Moderate and severe cases require individualized treatment. In young patients with extensive lesions, deep ulcers, corticosteroid dependence or corticosteroid resistance, early treatment with biological drugs combined with immunomodulators (Azathiopurine, methotrexate) is needed.\nCurrently, in Vietnam, anti-TNF (including two drugs Adalimumab and Infliximab) is used quite commonly in severe cases. When using biological drugs, it is necessary to pay attention to the risk of outbreaks of infection, latent tuberculosis and viral hepatitis.

It is necessary to ensure reasonable nutritional needs, correct micronutrient deficiencies and improve digestive symptoms. Intravenous nutrition is not recommended, total nutrition is indicated in cases of intestinal obstruction, short bowel syndrome or after surgery. Limit hard-to-absorb fibers, coffee, and alcohol.
