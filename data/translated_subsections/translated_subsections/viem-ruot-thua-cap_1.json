    "subsection_content": "Acute appendicitis often occurs due to a blockage of the appendix, increasing internal pressure and circulatory stagnation. At this time, bacteria begin to multiply and accumulate pus, thereby further damaging the intestinal wall, leading to pain and irritation. If the inflammation does not improve, part of the intestinal wall may become necrotic, leading to the formation of a hole, at which point pus and fecal fluid flow into the abdomen. This is a medical emergency, requiring urgent treatment intervention.(1)\nBesides the cause of obstruction due to fecal stones, infection can also occur due to a number of other factors such as:\nParasites (Roundworms burrow into the intestines).; Foreign bodies in the intestines, typically fruit seeds; Regional lymphatic hyperplasia, more common in people with disorders that lead to intestinal inflammation, such as: Diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.; Tumors in the appendix (this is very rare).\nBacteria multiply in the inflamed appendix",
