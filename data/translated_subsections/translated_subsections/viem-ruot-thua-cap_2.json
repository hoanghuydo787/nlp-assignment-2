    "subsection_content": "Symptoms of acute appendicitis often appear quickly and suddenly, starting with abdominal pain in the right iliac fossa, initially in the area above the umbilicus or around the umbilicus and then gradually localized in the right iliac fossa. The appendix can become necrotic or rupture within 24 - 72 hours, so timely treatment is required to avoid danger to life. Some recognizable signs include: (3)\nNausea and vomiting (especially in children).; Digestive disorders such as: anorexia, constipation, diarrhea...; Patients may feel tired and have a fever; Dry lips, dirty tongue.\n1. Symptoms of acute appendicitis during pregnancy\nIn the first 6 months of pregnancy, symptoms of acute appendicitis are not much different from normal women, typically:\nNausea.; Vomiting.; Cramp.\nIf nausea, vomiting and cramps persist, the person should seek emergency medical attention. In addition, the uterus can also push the appendix several centimeters into the upper abdomen, especially in the last 3 months. In this case, the pain from appendicitis often occurs in the upper right side of the abdomen and behind the back, instead of just appearing in the usual location (lower right side of the abdomen).\nDuring the last 3 months of pregnancy, acute appendicitis is often difficult to diagnose because of reduced abdominal wall sensitivity and effects on female hormones. It is especially important to note that appendicitis progresses very quickly in pregnant women, leading to necrosis, so correct diagnosis and early intervention are essential to protect the lives of the mother and fetus.\n2. Symptoms of acute appendicitis in children and adolescents\nChildren are more likely to get acute appendicitis, especially between the ages of 10 and 16. Young children experiencing this condition often have difficulty describing specific symptoms. Therefore, parents should monitor closely to easily recognize through the following signs:\nAbdominal pain, bending the right leg to the abdomen.; Fever.; Diarrhea, vomiting.; Tossing and turning and crying; Abdominal bloating\nAcute appendicitis in children is often confused with gastroenteritis. Misdiagnosis can increase the risk of necrosis and rupture of the appendix.\nAbdominal cramps with acute appendicitis",
