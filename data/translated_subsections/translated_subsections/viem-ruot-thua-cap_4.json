    "subsection_content": "Acute appendicitis is an emergency condition that can lead to death if not treated promptly. Some dangerous complications that need to be warned include:\n1. Perforation of the appendix\nWhen the appendix is ​​blocked, the fluid and mucus inside cannot escape, but instead accumulate, increasing pressure inside the organ. This leads to swelling and stimulates harmful bacteria to multiply. From here, the blood supply to the appendix is ​​inhibited. In the long term, reduced blood flow and untreated wounds will lead to cell death, tissue becoming spongy or holes forming. This condition is called a ruptured or perforated appendix.\nThe most worrying consequence is the leakage of bacteria and pus out of the organ and into surrounding tissues, leading to peritonitis. This is a very serious condition, causing pain to the patient and requiring urgent medical intervention. In addition to peritonitis, abscesses and gangrene are also dangerous complications.\nSymptoms of appendicitis perforation have the risk of getting worse over time. Severity also varies between cases. However, all patients need professional medical care for reasonable and effective treatment solutions.\n2. Peritonitis\nPeritonitis is not common, but if it occurs, it is a medical emergency because of the danger it causes. This is an infection that spreads from the appendix to the lining of the abdominal cavity. A typical symptom is pain, the level of pain becomes more severe as the infection spreads.\nNormally, a perforated appendix will cause pain to the peritoneum closest to the appendix, then spread further. Symptoms become worse when the patient bends the hip, coughs, or is subjected to pressure or touching. Some other accompanying signs include:\nFever, body temperature of 38 degrees C / 100.4 degrees F or higher; Chills.; Diarrhea or decreased intestinal motility (ileus).; Low blood pressure.; Heart beating fast.; Low urine output.; Sepsis.; Abscess around the appendix\nThis is the most common complication that occurs due to a perforated appendix. Specifically, an abscess is a collection of pus that forms in a tissue, space, or organ in the body. People experiencing this condition may have abdominal pain and high fever, but because they are quite common symptoms, it is difficult to diagnose accurately with a regular medical examination. Accordingly, abdominal ultrasound or CT scan is commonly prescribed to determine whether an abscess has formed.\nIf the abscess is small, the patient will be injected with antibiotics intravenously to reduce its size. Surgery to remove the appendix was also performed a few weeks later. During this time, the doctor will closely monitor the condition.\nIf the abscess is larger or has many different pockets of pus, the doctor will perform drainage and inject intravenous antibiotics. If the condition improves, the drain will be reinserted until the abscess is cleared. Surgery to remove the appendix continued a few weeks later. In the case of a large, multi-compartment abscess, surgical drainage needs to be performed quickly. Surgical excision can also be performed at the same time if it is safe for the patient.",
