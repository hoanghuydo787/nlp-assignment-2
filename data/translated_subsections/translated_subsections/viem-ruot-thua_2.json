    "subsection_content": "Typical signs of acute appendicitis are abdominal pain, nausea and fever. When swelling and inflammation become more severe, the adjacent abdominal wall will be irritated, leading to pain localization in the right lower quadrant. This symptom is often not noticed in children under 3 years old.\nSpecifically, the initial sign is a dull pain around the navel, which after a few hours will move to the right lower quadrant. The abdominal wall has now become very sensitive to light pressure. If the appendix is ​​located behind the cecum, palpation in the right lower quadrant will not cause pain. Similarly, if the appendix is ​​completely located in the pelvis, the patient will not notice any stiffness in the abdomen at all, only feeling pain at McBurney's point when coughing. In such cases, digital rectal examination will often reveal damage to the rectal sac.(2)",
