    "subsection_content": "Types of appendicitis are classified as follows:(3)\n1. Based on the cause of blockage\nInfectious appendicitis: Obstruction of the lumen of the appendix due to infection; Fibrosing appendicitis: Scar tissue from previous surgery leads to blockage.; Appendicitis due to waste: Hard stool blocks the exit of the appendix; Neoplastic appendicitis: Carcinoid, adenocarcinoma or mucinous tumor are the cause of increased fluid secretion leading to obstruction of the appendix, causing inflammation.; Parasitic appendicitis: Obstruction of the appendix due to parasite invasion, causing inflammation; Appendicitis with stones: Obstruction of the intestinal lumen due to cell hyperplasia, leading to inflammation.\n2. Based on the degree of perforation\nPerforated appendicitis: The wall of the appendix has been damaged by pressure and inflammation, causing contents to leak into the peritoneal cavity. The incidence of the disease often tends to increase with age and is related to the infiltration of the following bacteria: Escherichia coli, streptococcus, Bacteroides fragilis, Pseudomonas.; Perforated appendicitis: The wall of the appendix has been damaged by pressure and inflammation, causing contents to leak into the peritoneal cavity. The incidence of the disease often tends to increase with age and is related to infiltration by the following bacteria: Escherichia coli, streptococcus, Bacteroides fragilis, Pseudomonas.\nNon-perforated appendicitis: Inflammation occurs only inside the appendix, there is no leakage.; Non-perforated appendicitis: Inflammation occurs only inside the appendix, without leakage.\n3. Based on the time of progression of symptoms\nAcute appendicitis: Symptoms of inflammation have occurred and have lasted less than 48 hours.; Chronic appendicitis: Symptoms have persisted for days, weeks, or have recurred multiple times.",
