    "subsection_content": "According to Dr. Huong, anyone can get otitis media, but the disease is more common in children aged 6-36 months because the structure of the eustachian tube is shorter and more horizontal than that of adults, so the ability to drain fluid is poorer. .\nThe eustachian tube is the part that connects the middle ear to the roof of the nose. If the eustachian tube is blocked, mucus will stagnate in the middle ear, creating a favorable environment for bacteria to cause inflammation and infection.\nChildren at risk of otitis media include:\nChildren use pacifiers and drink bottles; Children living in air polluted environments or frequently experiencing changes in altitude or climate change; Your child has colds, sinusitis, flu, or recurring ear infections.; Children with birth defects in the nasopharynx; Children have weak immunity.; Foreign objects or water entering the ear are not cleaned.",
