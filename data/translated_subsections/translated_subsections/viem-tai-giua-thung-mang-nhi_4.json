    "subsection_content": "According to Dr. Huong, the method of diagnosing chronic otitis media with atrial perforation is usually based on clinical and paraclinical assessment and differential diagnosis is also very necessary.\n1. Paraclinical assessments\nOtoscopy: See thick, rotten ear pus, prolonged ear discharge, possibly cholesteatoma. The eardrum can be collapsed, bulging, perforated, the edge of the hole is rough, there may be inflammatory tissue in the eardrum, the bottom of the eardrum is dirty.; Ear culture: This method helps identify pathogenic bacteria and make antibiograms.; CT-scan, MRI of temporal ear: helps determine diagnosis, extent of pathology in the middle ear and surrounding structures, resorption of ossicles or temporal bones, intracranial complications...; Audiometry: This method helps evaluate the patient's hearing ability.(3)\n2. Differential diagnosis\nDr. Huong said that differential diagnoses to differentiate chronic otitis media with atrial perforation and other conditions with many similar symptoms that can easily be confused with chronic otitis media with atrial perforation include:\nBoils or inflammation of the external ear canal: when pulling the ear lobe and pressing the ear jar, there is pain, endoscopy shows inflammation of the external ear canal.; Inflammation of the lymph nodes or connective tissue behind the ear: This disease has no history of ear discharge, normal hearing.; Post-tuberculosis otitis media: Need to ask about history and take chest X-ray...; Otitis media caused by spirochetes and syphilis: Need to ask medical history and do specialized tests to diagnose.\nThe child had an endoscopy to check for ear diseases at Tam Anh General Hospital.",
