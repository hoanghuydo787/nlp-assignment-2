    "subsection_content": "Doctors can diagnose otitis media with effusion using the following methods:\n1. Otoscopy\nThis method uses an otoscope or endoscope to detect changes in the eardrum such as amber or opaque yellow color, increased blood vessels of the hammer head; The eardrum has shrinkage; stretch membrane has the shape of a bag; abnormally transparent eardrum; The tympanic cavity contains fluid, has a slightly watery level or air bubbles appear in the ear fluid; blue eardrum, especially in otitis media with mucus secretion.(4)\n2. Tympanometry\nMay be done to confirm the presence of middle ear fluid (i.e., by showing an immobile eardrum). This is the most reliable objective test to diagnose otitis media with effusion at any age. In addition, this method also helps screen and monitor treatment progress.\n3. Audiometry\nAudiometry is applied to children over 4 years old and adults, helping to assess the severity of the disease. This method can also be used to monitor the progress and effectiveness of treatment. The average hearing loss for mild otitis media with effusion is 23dB, for moderate it is 29dB and for severe it is 34dB.\nCurrently, Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City is using the Danish Interacoustic audiological function tester and the Danish Interacoustic cochlear sound measuring hearing loss diagnostic machine in medical examination and treatment. These are the two leading modern machines in the world today for accurate diagnosis, thereby greatly supporting doctors in providing effective, targeted treatment for otitis media with effusion and other diseases. Ear diseases in general.\nIn addition, Dr. Huong recommends that adults and adolescents need a nose and throat examination to rule out malignant tumors. There should be special suspicion for nasopharyngeal malignancy in cases of unilateral otitis media with effusion. If malignancy is suspected, imaging tests and pathologic biopsy should be performed next.\nOtitis media with effusion can be diagnosed using otoscopy",
