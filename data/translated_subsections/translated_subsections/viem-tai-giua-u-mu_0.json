    "subsection_content": "Purulent otitis media is a condition in which the middle ear is filled with fluid, then the ear fluid becomes infected, causing pus in the ear. The culprit causing ear infections may be bacterial infection from the nose and throat. This condition is more common in children because the short and horizontal structure of the Eustachian tube makes it easier for fluid in the nasopharynx to pass through the Eustachian tube into the middle ear.\nAccording to Nguyen Thi Huong, M.D., Department of Otolaryngology, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, purulent otitis media is divided into two conditions: acute purulent otitis media and chronic purulent otitis media based on duration of the disease.\n1. Acute purulent otitis media\nAcute suppurative otitis media is an inflammation of the middle ear with fluid. These fluids are infected with bacteria from the nasopharynx, leading to acute purulent otitis media.\nAccording to research, more than 80% of children will have an episode of acute otitis media at least once in their lives and by age 3. Statistics show that up to 40% of children will have at least three episodes of acute otitis media.\n2. Chronic purulent otitis media\nChronic purulent otitis media is chronic serous otitis media with benign fluid in the ear and then infected fluid lasting more than 3 months.\nThis disease occurs in both adults and children, but children are more susceptible.",
