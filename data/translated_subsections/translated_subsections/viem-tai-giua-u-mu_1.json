Causes of acute purulent otitis media\nThe cause of acute suppurative otitis media is mainly viral and bacterial infections. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common bacteria causing acute otitis media in infants. In children under 14 years of age, infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, untyped Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis are the most common causes.; The cause of acute suppurative otitis media is mainly viral and bacterial infections.
