    "subsection_content": "Physical examination, medical history, and otoscopy can help detect purulent otitis media.\n1. Diagnosis of acute purulent otitis media\nDiagnosis of acute otitis media is based clinically on the presence of acute pain (within 48 hours).\nPatients have symptoms of ear pain, fever, loss of appetite, vomiting, and ear discharge. Insomnia at night, tired days and nodding off.\nThe doctor examined the eardrum and found that the eardrum was bulging and normal anatomical landmarks were missing. Otoscopy and/or tympanometry shows an immobile eardrum.\nIn acute purulent otitis media, bacterial culture testing is usually not performed.\n2. Diagnosis of chronic purulent otitis media\nDiagnosis of chronic purulent otitis media is based on clinical evidence with the following tests and imaging:\nCulture of ear pus; CT or MRI scan: If cholesteatoma or other complications are suspected such as in patients with fever or patients with dizziness or ear pain. These techniques can detect structural abnormalities inside the ear or inside the skull, such as brain abscess, meningoencephalitis, labyrinthitis, etc.; Ear biopsy: If the patient has persistent or recurrent granulation tissue, an ear biopsy is necessary to rule out dangerous diseases.",
