Treatment of acute purulent otitis media\nUse medicine\nTreatment of acute purulent otitis media often uses broad-spectrum oral antibiotics.\nIf acute purulent otitis media does not respond to first-line antibiotics, the patient needs to have a culture test and an antibiotic test done through a tympanic puncture.\nAfter cleaning the ear canal, the doctor may proceed to suction the ear fluid.\nSurgery\nSurgery may be indicated when there are complications, such as for brain abscess drainage and mastoid drainage. VII nerve decompression surgery is performed when there are complications of facial paralysis...\n2. Treatment of chronic purulent otitis media\nUse of topical ear drops: Ciprofloxacin topical ear drops is a popular drug in the treatment of chronic purulent otitis media with perforated eardrum. The recommended dose is 2 times/day and treatment lasts for 14 days as prescribed by your doctor. Systemic antibiotics: For severe acute inflammation, patients need to be treated with systemic antibiotics. Using amoxicillin combined with oral clavulanic acid is the first choice. Additionally, patients may be treated for these severe exacerbations with a third-generation cephalosporin, which is then adjusted based on pus culture results and response to treatment.; Topical ear drops: Ciprofloxacin topical ear drops are a popular drug in the treatment of chronic purulent otitis media with perforated eardrum.

Disrupted ossicular chains can also be reconstructed through surgery. Osteoarthritis can be postponed until a second surgery. Open or endoscopic surgery is performed to reconstruct the ossicular chain 6-12 months after tympanic membrane repair surgery.\nSurgery is needed if purulent otitis media causes serious complications",
