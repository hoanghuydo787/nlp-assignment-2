    "subsection_content": "Ear infections are caused by bacteria or viruses in the middle ear. Infection also often occurs due to colds, flu or allergies that cause blockage of the posterior nasal passages (adenoiditis), throat and eustachian tubes.\nEustachian tube: Is a very narrow ear canal that connects the middle ear and nasopharynx. The eustachian tube is responsible for regulating air pressure and refreshing the air in the ear, while also draining normal secretions from the middle ear. When the eustachian tube is swollen, it can become clogged, causing fluid to build up in the middle ear, causing infection. In children, the eustachian tubes are not yet developed, so they are often narrower and more horizontal, making drainage difficult, leading to middle ear infections.; VA (Adenoids): Is a small lymphoid tissue located at the back of the nose, which plays a role in functioning as an immune system. Because the adenoids are located near the opening of the eustachian tubes, when the adenoids become inflamed and swollen, they can block the eustachian tubes, leading to middle ear infections. Otitis media caused by adenoiditis occurs more often in children than in adults.",
