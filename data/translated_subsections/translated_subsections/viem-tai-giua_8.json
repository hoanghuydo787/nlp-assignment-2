    "subsection_content": "According to Dr. Hang, most ear infections do not cause long-term complications. However, if ear infections are not treated completely and recur many times, they can lead to serious complications, affecting the patient's hearing and long-term health. Some of the most common complications include:\nHearing loss: Usually mild hearing loss may appear and disappear on its own as the ear infection clears. But repeated ear infections, or severe ear infections that develop pus in the middle ear, can lead to severe hearing loss, damage to the eardrum, and permanent hearing loss.; Speech or developmental delays: If infants and toddlers have temporary or permanent hearing loss, it can cause delays in speech, social communication, and developmental skills.; Perforated eardrum: Most perforated eardrums heal within 72 hours, but many cases require surgical intervention.; Encephalitis or meningitis: If the infection is not treated or does not respond well to treatment, it can spread to nearby tissues causing a mastoid infection called mastoiditis. Mastoiditis can lead to bone damage and the formation of pus-filled cysts. Severe middle ear infections can also spread to other tissues in the skull, including the brain or the membranes surrounding the brain causing meningitis.(3)\nOtitis media can cause complications of encephalitis - meningitis.",
