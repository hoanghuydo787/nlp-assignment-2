    "subsection_content": "Otitis externa has an incidence of about 10% and can present in acute, chronic and malignant (necrotizing) forms.\n1. Acute otitis externa\nThis is an inflammation of the outer ear that lasts less than 3 weeks. Many cases of acute otitis externa heal on their own within 10 days.\n2. Chronic otitis externa\nSymptoms of otitis externa lasting more than 3 months, or more than 4 episodes of otitis externa per year, are called chronic otitis externa.\nChronic otitis externa can be caused by acute otitis externa that is not fully and properly treated. Another common cause is skin disease in the ear canal such as atopic dermatitis or psoriasis.\nOver 50% of patients with chronic otitis externa suffer from both ears. Typical symptoms of the disease are itching, ear pain and conductive hearing loss due to blockage in the ear.\nSymptoms of chronic otitis externa can be seen as dry, scaly, moist red skin or shine in the ear canal. Patients may experience itching, which affects the ear canal and causes scratches. This may be the cause of acute otitis externa. Chronic otitis externa can cause progressive fibrosis of the ear canal.\n3. Malignant otitis externa (necrosis)\nMalignant otitis externa is an infection that destroys the external auditory canal and surrounding soft tissues, causing meningitis and osteomyelitis of the lateral skull base. This condition arises mainly in elderly men with diabetes or immunodeficiency.\nThe incidence of malignant otitis externa is not precisely known. Rare cases have been described in severely immunocompromised children, such as children with acute leukemia or children who have undergone bone marrow transplantation.\nEarly diagnosis is essential because malignant otitis externa is difficult to treat and can be fatal. Therefore, patients need to be examined for timely treatment.",
