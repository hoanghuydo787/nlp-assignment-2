    "subsection_content": "For mild cases of external otitis, treatment requires cleaning the ear canal and using topical ear drops. In more severe cases, oral medication is needed. When otitis externa becomes complicated, surgery may be needed.\n1. Instructions for cleaning the ear canal\nEar canal cleaning needs to be done in a hospital, by an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist. In localities where there is no ENT specialist, it can be performed by a Pediatrician or General Practitioner.\nNon-traumatic cleaning of the ear canal includes removal of earwax and secretions. Secretions may contain toxins, such as Pseudomonas exotoxin A. This toxin prolongs the inflammatory process and limits or prevents the effectiveness of topical medications.\nThe Ear, Nose and Throat doctor will conduct an endoscopy or microscope to observe, and use a suction tube or tools to clean the ear canal. Once the eardrum is intact, the ear canal can be carefully flushed with appropriate antiseptic solutions.\nDoctor Nguyen Thi Huong recommends that patients should not clean their ears at home, because it can damage the ear, allowing bacteria to enter, causing more severe inflammation.\n2. Treatment of acute otitis externa\nTreatment of uncomplicated acute otitis externa includes ear canal cleaning, antiseptic treatment, topical antibacterial treatment, and pain control.\nMedications commonly used to treat outer ear infections include ear washes, antibiotics, and topical anti-inflammatory drugs. You can take paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve pain.(1)\nYour doctor may prescribe oral antibiotic treatment for more severe ear infections, edema of the ear canal, widespread disease, poorly controlled diabetes or immunodeficiency, or spot does not respond.\nParenteral antibiotic therapy should be considered in limited cases, if malignant otitis is suspected, systemic manifestations are present or when signs of sepsis are seen.\nAcute bacterial outer ear infections usually improve after a few days of treatment. If symptoms do not improve, the patient should see an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist for appropriate treatment.\n3. Treatment of external ear canal fungus\nIn case of fungal infection, the doctor will remove all fungal tissue, clean the ear canal, and use ear drops with antifungal effects (ciclopirox, nystatin, clotrimazole or miconazole).\nWhen the eardrum is perforated and topical cleaning treatments are not effective, your doctor may use systemic antifungal medications, such as fluconazole or itraconazole.\n4. Treatment of external ear canal boils\nBoils are infections of the outer ear, forming abscesses of hair follicles in the cartilage of the external auditory canal. The cause of this type of inflammation is mainly Staphylococcus aureus.\nFor mild cases, the patient will be treated with topical antibiotic ear drops, along with pain relievers. If more serious, the patient will receive additional treatment with oral antibiotics and boil injections if necessary.\n5. Treatment of chronic otitis externa\nThe goal of treatment is to return the skin of the ear canal to its original normal state and allow for routine earwax cleaning. Patients should keep the ear canal dry and avoid shampoo or soap falling into the ear, causing irritation and inflammation of the ear canal.\nTreatment of underlying diseases, such as skin diseases or autoimmune disorders, is essential in patients with skin diseases.\nWhen a patient has an acute inflammatory episode, the doctor may prescribe systemic medications or topical antibacterial or antifungal medications, depending on the case, to completely treat and instruct the patient on proper ear care.\nOral corticosteroids may be effective in cases where the disease has not responded to other forms of treatment. Otoplasty to widen the ear canal is only indicated if the ear canal is narrow.\n6. Treatment of malignant otitis externa\nResearch on the treatment of malignant otitis externa is incomplete. However, parenteral or oral antibiotics can be selected according to culture and antibiogram results. Dosage is recommended for at least 4-6 weeks to allow the affected bone tissue to revascularize.\nIf antibiogram results are not available, the patient may be started on antibiotic treatment depending on the severity of the disease.\nIn addition, local treatment can be done by placing an antibiotic-impregnated ear meche in the ear canal. If the condition persists or does not respond to medical treatment, necrotic tissue and bone will be surgically removed. The reason is that these necrotic tissues and bones reduce the ability of antibiotics to penetrate the involved tissue.\nIn addition, optimal blood sugar control is mandatory in treatment. Concomitant hyperbaric oxygen therapy may increase cure rates, but there are no randomized controlled trials on this topic.\nDuring treatment, doctors may perform regular paraclinical and imaging examinations to assess response to treatment and early detect recurrence (if any).\nOsteomyelitis in malignant otitis externa is associated with a mortality rate of 10-21%. The mortality rate increases if two or more of the following factors are present: age >70, diabetes, facial nerve paralysis, or CT scan results showing necrotizing osteitis (bone erosion, soft tissue swelling). ).\nOtoscopy should be examined 48-72 hours after treatment to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment\n7. Monitoring and secondary prevention\nIn the treatment of otitis externa, the doctor will check after 48-72 hours of treatment. If there is no response, your doctor will adjust your treatment.\nRisk factors should be avoided to prevent further episodes of infection. In particular, the ear canal must be kept dry and should be dried with a hair dryer if water gets in.",
