    "subsection_content": "The mastoid bone belongs to the temporal bone of the skull. Mastoiditis is a bacterial infection of the mastoid air cells that surround the inner and middle ear. Mastoid air cells protect the delicate structures of the ear, regulate ear pressure, and can protect the temporal bone during injury. When mastoid cells become infected or inflamed, usually due to untreated otitis media, mastoiditis results.\nDr. Phuc Anh said, because there are many important structures located in and around the mastoid bone, if infected, bacteria can spread outside the mastoid bone and cause serious complications.\nOtitis mastoiditis is divided into two types including:\n1. Acute otitis media\nIs an infection that occurs within 5-7 days caused by bacteria, the most common being Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus. This is the most common complication of acute otitis media, with an average rate of about 0.24%.\nAlthough rare, children under 2 years old are at highest risk. If not treated promptly, children are susceptible to serious extracranial complications such as subperiosteal abscess, Bezold's abscess or intracranial complications such as facial nerve paralysis, labyrinthitis, subdural abscess …can be life-threatening.(3)\n2. Chronic mastoiditis\nThis is a condition in which the middle ear and mastoid bone are continuously infected, causing ear discharge that lasts for more than 3 months. This condition can also cause dangerous intracranial and extracranial complications, similar to those in acute mastoiditis.",
