    "subsection_content": "According to Dr. Phuc Anh, most cases of mastoiditis stem from progressive acute otitis media causing blockage of the Eustachian tube, leading to inflammation and infection of the mastoid bone. The Eustachian tube connects from the middle ear to the nose and throat, and is responsible for circulating fluid or air from the middle ear. If this tube is narrowed due to infection or dirt, it will create a favorable environment for pathogens to grow.(2)\nIn addition, pneumonia caused by streptococcus, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae are also risk factors for mastoiditis in addition to subjects susceptible to mastoiditis. Mentioned above.\nStreptococcus pyogenes is one of the common bacteria that causes mastoiditis.",
