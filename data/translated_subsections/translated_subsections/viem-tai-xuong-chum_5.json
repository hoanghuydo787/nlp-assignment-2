Symptoms commonly used for evaluation include cellulitis, otitis externa, lymphadenopathy, trauma, and tumors. It should be noted that tumors such as rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and myofibroblastoma that develop on one or both sides of the head have symptoms that are easily confused with mastoiditis. However, these tumors often affect the cranial nerves, causing neurological symptoms but rarely cause fever as in mastoiditis. This difference is an important factor that needs to be carefully considered.; Differential diagnosis: According to Dr. Phuc Anh, it is necessary to make a differential diagnosis by doing a thorough physical examination as well as taking medical history so as not to ignore signs that mimic common symptoms, leading to missed diagnosis and treatment. delayed treatment.
