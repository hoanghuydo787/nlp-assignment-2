Medical treatment\nAntibiotic therapy is the focus of medical treatment. Patients with no complications and no significant medical history can be treated with intravenous antibiotics. People with uncomplicated acute mastoiditis were considered patients without significant medical history.\nFigure 3:\nMedical treatment with antibiotics for uncomplicated cases of mastoiditis without complications\n2.

These are two types of bacteria that can cause complications in 50% of patients with mastoiditis. Patients also need to continuously monitor their health because their health condition can deteriorate quickly.",
