Common types of ear infections include:\n1. Otitis externa\nOtitis externa is an acute infection of the skin of the ear canal usually caused by bacteria and fungi. Pseudomonas bacteria are the most common cause of this type of ear infection.\nThe external ear includes the pinna and the external auditory canal, measured from the eardrum to the outside of the ear.\nOtitis externa is divided into types including:\n1.1 Acute diffuse otitis externa\nMay present as a localized boil or diffuse infection of the entire ear canal.\n1.2 Ear infections caused by swimming\nIt is a bacterial infection usually caused by water remaining in the external ear canal for a long time, creating a moist environment for bacteria to grow. This type of ear infection has the English term swimmer's ear, is the most common disease in children and is not contagious.(1)\n1.3 Fungus of the external auditory canal\nIt is a condition in which the outer ear becomes inflamed and infected due to a fungal infection. The most common fungal species that cause diseases of the outer ear are Aspergillus and Candida.\n2. Otitis media\nOtitis media is an infection in the middle ear. This type of ear infection is most common in preschool-age children.\nThe middle ear includes the mastoid bone and the tympanic cavity. It is part of the temporal bone, filled with air.\nThere are three types of otitis media, including:\n2.1 Acute otitis media (AOM)\nOnly occurs for a short period of time, usually no more than 4 weeks, and then goes away on its own.\n2.2 Serous otitis media (OME)\nThis condition occurs when fluid builds up in the middle ear without causing an infection. Serous otitis media usually does not cause fever or ear pain.(2)\n2.3 Chronic purulent otitis media (CSOM)\nCSOM is a consequence of acute otitis media without complete treatment. This condition includes otitis media and is characterized by persistent secretions from the middle ear through a perforated eardrum.\n2.4 Malignant otitis externa\nThis is a serious osteomyelitis of the temporal bone (usually caused by Pseudomonas bacteria). This condition is relatively rare, occurring in the elderly, diabetics and immunocompromised people.\n3. Inner ear infection\nOtitis media is an infection of the inner ear. The cause may be due to infection with the flu virus, but it may also be due to an infection spreading from the middle ear inside.\nThe inner ear includes the cochlea, semicircular canals, and vestibule.\nInner ear infections are divided into two types:\n3.1 Labyrinthitis\nLabyrinthitis is an infection of the labyrinth of the ear. The labyrinth is a part of the inner ear that helps control hearing and balance. Labyrinthitis is often caused by a viral or bacterial infection.\n3.2 Vestibular neuritis\nVestibular neuritis is an infection of the vestibular nerve, often seen after influenza infection. The vestibular nerve is part of the inner ear, helping to transmit nerve signals from the vestibular organ to the brain.",
