    "subsection_content": "Doctor Truong Tri Tuong said that depending on the type of ear infection, doctors can recommend appropriate treatment methods including medical treatment and surgical treatment.\n1. Medical treatment\nThis method includes ear cleaning, using medications and can be combined with home treatment methods.\nMedications commonly used to treat ear infections include ear drops, topical ear medications, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory medications. In some cases, antifungal medication may be needed if there is evidence of a fungal infection.\nThe most commonly used medications for ear infections include acetic acid and topical corticosteroids, and antibiotic ear drops such as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, or neomycin/polymyxin. Antifungal drugs gentian, cresylate acetate, nystatin, clotrimazole...\n2. Be careful when using medicine to treat ear infections in children\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the following medications to treat ear infections in children.\nAnalgesic\nChildren under 6 months of age: Use only acetaminophen.; Children 6 months and older: Can give acetaminophen or ibuprofen.; Do not give children aspirin because it can cause Reye's syndrome. Reye syndrome is a very serious but rare disease that can damage the liver and brain.\nCough and cold medicine\nChildren under 4 years old: Parents need to use medicine as prescribed by the doctor. Do not use over-the-counter cough and cold medicine for children because it can cause dangerous side effects for children.; Children 4 years and older: Parents need to talk to their doctor about whether over-the-counter cough and cold medications are safe for children.\nParents should always consult a specialist about any medication used to treat ear infections in children. Only use antibiotics as prescribed by your doctor.\n3. Surgical treatment\nThis is an invasive treatment that involves surgery or procedures. Surgery is the last option when medical treatments are ineffective.\nSurgery is often applied to severe cases of ear infections, mainly to resolve complications such as mastoiditis, hearing loss, loss of balance, etc.\n4. Ear drum repair surgery\nThis surgical procedure repairs a perforated eardrum caused by infection and helps prevent future infections, improving hearing. Tympanoplasty is usually performed on patients who do not have an infection or cancer in the ear bones.\nThe surgical process will use grafts taken from the patient's own body, usually fascia, meniscus or ear cartilage to repair the eardrum. After 6-8 weeks of surgery, patients can improve their hearing ability.\n5. Open the tympanic membrane and place a drainage tube\nBilateral tympanostomy and drainage tubes are used for patients who frequently have fluid buildup in the middle ear.\nDuring surgery, the doctor will create a small hole and insert an artificial tube to drain the ear fluid out. The patient can leave the hospital the same day, and the eardrum can heal when the drainage tube falls out on its own, usually a few months after surgery.\n6. Drill the mastoid bone\nThe mastoid bone is the bone behind the ear that connects to the middle ear. The surgeon will make an incision behind the ear to access the mastoid bone. Then, the doctor drills and cleans the mastoid bone to help prevent chronic ear infections.\nDoctors from the Department of Ear, Nose and Throat, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, perform tympanic surgery to treat ear infections for patients.",
