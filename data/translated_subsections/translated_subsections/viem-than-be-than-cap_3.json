    "subsection_content": "Pyelonephritis is an acute infectious disease. If not accurately diagnosed and treated promptly, it will cause many dangerous complications such as: Sepsis, kidney failure, kidney necrosis, abscess of the kidney and surrounding area. kidney…\nKidney abscess: is the appearance of pus around the kidney due to infection of the soft tissues surrounding the kidney. If not treated promptly, the patient may experience dangerous complications; Sepsis: Is a condition in which bacteria spread into the blood, indicating a severe systemic infection, which can cause septic shock and multiple organ failure. Sepsis can be life-threatening if not treated properly and promptly.; Acute kidney failure: This is a dangerous complication of acute pyelonephritis, manifested by oliguria or anuria, blood tests with very high urea/creatinine levels. Acute kidney failure can cause complications such as acute hypertension or acute pulmonary edema which can be life-threatening. If not treated properly, acute kidney failure can progress to chronic kidney failure.; Renal papillary necrosis: Severe infection with prolonged pyelonephritis causes necrosis of the renal papilla, causing all or part of the renal papilla to die. The renal papilla is the opening of the collecting duct into the kidney and is where urine flows into the ureter. When necrosis, the renal papilla peels off and follows the urine, causing blockage in the ureter or urethra. If not resolved, it will cause pyelonephritis to become worse. From there, the patient is at risk of acute kidney failure and cramps; Antibiotic resistance: Partly due to the nature of multi-resistant bacteria, partly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics, not enough dose and not long enough.; Chronic pyelonephritis, chronic renal failure: Acute pyelonephritis has antibiotic resistance and frequent re-inflammation. If not properly monitored and treated, it will lead to chronic pyelonephritis and chronic kidney failure. At this time, treatment will be more difficult and expensive for the patient.",
