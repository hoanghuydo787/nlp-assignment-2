    "subsection_content": "Lupus nephritis is kidney damage in lupus (lupus glomerulonephritis) due to the mechanism of immune complexes circulating in the circulation to deposit in the glomerulus. It is found that there is a relationship between the concentration of anti-DNA antibodies in the serum of patients with glomerular disease, as well as the level of immune complex deposition in the glomeruli of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. (first)\nSystemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease. In people with autoimmune diseases, instead of attacking substances that harm the body, the immune system attacks healthy tissues and organs, including the kidneys.\n​\nThis condition can lead to kidney inflammation, blood in the urine, protein in the urine, high blood pressure, impaired kidney function, and even kidney failure. About 60% of people with systemic lupus erythematosus develop kidney complications. Lupus nephritis develops early and progresses very quickly.",
