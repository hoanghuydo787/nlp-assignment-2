Many genes have yet to be identified that are associated with this condition. Normally, the immune system is the barrier that protects the body from infection. However, when problems arise, the immune system cannot distinguish between harmful and healthy substances.

Characteristics of lupus nephritis include:\nAntigens specifically target nucleosomes.; Autoantibodies with high affinity form intravascular immune complexes (autoantibodies are small in size, only about 200bp); Autoantibodies of certain isotypes trigger complement activation.",
