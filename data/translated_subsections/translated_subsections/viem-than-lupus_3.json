    "subsection_content": "WHO has classified histopathological lesions in systemic lupus erythematosus into 6 classes, specifically:\nClass I: Normal glomeruli: No clinical manifestations appear. Urine and kidney function test results are normal.; Class II: Mesangial lupus glomerulonephritis. At that time, kidney damage was more obvious with symptoms including hematuria, possibly accompanied by low proteinuria. Some rarer cases include nephrotic syndrome; Class III: Local and segmental proliferative lupus glomerulonephritis. About 15-20% of patients have impaired kidney function and about 1⁄3 have nephrotic syndrome; Class IV: Diffuse proliferative lupus glomerulonephritis. More than 50% of important blood vessels in the kidney are damaged. Patients with nephrotic syndrome often have impaired kidney function.; Class V : Membranous lupus glomerulonephritis. Nephrotic syndrome is the most common clinical sign. Patients may then be prescribed dialysis or kidney transplant.; Class VI: Glomerulosclerosis ( advanced glomerulonephritis) is a common condition in cases of nephritis several years ago. Clinical manifestations include kidney failure, high blood pressure and nephrotic syndrome. More than 90% of important blood vessels in the kidneys lose their ability to function. functional ability.",
