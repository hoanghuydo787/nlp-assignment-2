    "subsection_content": "The diagnosis process will begin with a medical history, physical examination and assessment of symptoms. After that, the patient may be prescribed necessary tests or diagnostic imaging, specifically:\n1. Blood and urine tests\nBlood tests: Assess waste levels such as creatinine, urea.; 24-hour urine collection: Measures the kidney's ability to filter waste and determines protein concentration in the urine.; Urine test: Check kidney function, measure protein concentration, white blood cells and red blood cells.; Iothalamate clearance test: This test is performed by injecting radioactive Iothalamate into the patient's blood. The doctor will then test how quickly the substance is filtered from the blood and excreted into the urine.\n2. Kidney biopsy\nA biopsy is the most accurate method for diagnosing lupus kidney disease. This method uses a long needle inserted through the back (hip) and into the kidney under ultrasound guidance, then takes a sample of kidney tissue to analyze signs of damage. The biopsy results will help doctors determine the stage of the disease, thereby providing appropriate treatment.\n3. Ultrasound\nThis diagnostic method will use sound waves to create detailed images of the patient's kidneys. From there, doctors can detect abnormalities in the kidneys, but they are of little value in the early stages and are only of reference value for lupus kidney disease.",
