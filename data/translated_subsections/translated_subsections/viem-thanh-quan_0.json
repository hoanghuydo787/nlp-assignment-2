    "subsection_content": "Laryngitis is inflammation of the larynx due to overuse, irritation or infection.\nInside the larynx are the vocal cords – two folds of mucous membrane – that cover muscle and cartilage. Normally, the vocal cords open and close rhythmically, creating sound through their movement and vibration.\nLaryngitis makes the throat easily irritated\n“When the larynx is inflamed, the vocal cords easily fall into a state of irritation. Causes swelling in the vocal cords, distorting sound when air passes through. As a result, the voice becomes changed and weakened. In some cases, people with laryngitis may lose their voice,\" said Dr. Tran Thi Thuy Hang, Head of the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City.\nLaryngitis can be short-term (acute) or long-lasting (chronic). Most cases of laryngitis are caused by a temporary viral infection and are not serious. However, persistent hoarseness is sometimes seen as signaling a more serious underlying medical condition.
