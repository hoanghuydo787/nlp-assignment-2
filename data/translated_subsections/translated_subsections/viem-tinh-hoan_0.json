    "subsection_content": "Orchitis is a condition in which a person's testicles are inflamed on one or both sides. The most common is unilateral orchitis caused by a urinary tract infection. The disease can be transmitted from person to person through blood. Therefore, people who have unsafe sex are more likely to get orchitis than other groups of people. (first)\nTesticles are an organ located in the male gonads, whose main role is to produce sperm and secrete testosterone, the male sex hormone. The testicles are covered by  a thin bag of skin, called the scrotum, underneath and behind the penis. The testicles function under the influence of the testicular plexus, which contains nerves from the renal plexus and the aorta.\nThe average size of a normal testicle is 4 - 5.1cm. In case the testicles are larger than 5.1cm, it means that the person is likely to suffer from diseases related to the testicles, including orchitis.\nCommon orchitis is orchitis caused by urinary infection, and some cases are caused by epididymitis that spreads bacteria to the testicles. The disease occurs most often in young, sexually active men because this is the factor that makes men most susceptible to urinary tract infections.\nThere are two types of orchitis: acute and chronic. For acute orchitis, although the disease can cause pain and inconvenient symptoms, it can be completely treated with simple internal medicine methods, using oral medication.\nHowever, patients should not be subjective about orchitis. In case the patient does not treat the disease or treats orchitis incorrectly, the disease will gradually develop into chronic orchitis. The disease poses countless risks of other urinary complications, directly affecting the patient's health and fertility.",
