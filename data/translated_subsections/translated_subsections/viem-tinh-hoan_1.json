    "subsection_content": "The causes of orchitis are very diverse, but the most common are urinary tract infections, the consequences of mumps and unprotected sex.\n1. Mumps & autoimmune diseases\nOrchitis is mostly caused by bacteria. Among them, mumps bacteria, belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family that causes mumps, is the most common bacteria that causes orchitis. (2)\nThe rate of men getting orchitis after 4-7 days of mumps is quite high, for every 3 people with mumps, 1 person will have orchitis afterward. This means that subjects including post-pubescent children and people who are not vaccinated against mumps are more likely to get orchitis than others.\nSee more: Common symptoms of orchitis caused by mumps\nIn addition, other autoimmune diseases can also cause orchitis in men including:\nChicken pot; Cytomegalovirus infection, cytomegalovirus infection; HFMD\n2. Sexually transmitted diseases STDs & unsafe sexual activities\nOrchitis caused by STDs and sexually transmitted diseases is also a common cause in cases.\nFirst, orchitis is a disease that can be transmitted from person to person by blood. Unsafe sex carries a high risk of transmitting viruses through blood. Therefore, in case of unprotected sex with someone who has orchitis, you will also have a high chance of getting orchitis.\nIn addition, other sexually transmitted STDs also lead to orchitis. The explanation is because the testicles are the closest organs and are directly in contact with bacteria that cause disease in humans. Therefore, when men have STDs, they need to pay attention to their risk of orchitis.\nSexually transmitted diseases that can cause orchitis include:\nGonorrhea; Syphilis; Epididymitis\n3. Urinary tract infection\nOrchitis can be a consequence of other urinary tract infections. In particular, infections that are not treated early will increase the risk of orchitis in patients, because then disease-causing bacteria will develop and spread to other nearby parts and organs.\nUrinary tract infections that can lead to orchitis include:\nInfection with E.coli, staphylococcus and streptococcus bacteria; Prostatitis; Infections caused by placing catheters or medical instruments in the penis",
