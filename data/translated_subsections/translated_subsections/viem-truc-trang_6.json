    "subsection_content": "The main goals of treating proctitis are to reduce inflammation, control pain, and eliminate infection if present. The sooner proctitis is treated, the higher the chance of complete recovery.\nSpecific treatment depends on the cause of the disease.\n1. Treatment of proctitis caused by infection\nIn this case, the patient may need medications to treat infections such as antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, etc.\n2. Treatment of proctitis caused by radiation therapy\nIf the severity is mild, the patient may not need treatment. In cases where radiation proctitis causes pain and heavy bleeding, doctors may recommend measures such as medication to control inflammation and bleeding; Use stool softeners to make it easier for patients to defecate; Finally, treatment destroys the damaged tissue by removing the bleeding tissue. Rectal endoscopy and Argon hemostasis are the optimal treatment\n3. Treatment of proctitis caused by inflammatory bowel disease\nIf proctitis is related to Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, the person will need to focus on reducing inflammation. Treatment may require anti-inflammatory drugs, immune system suppressants, oral medications, injections, rectal suppositories or enemas. Probiotic injection into the rectum - colon is a supportive treatment method mentioned quite a lot in current medical literature.\n4. Surgical treatment\nIf medical treatment does not help your proctitis go away or the disease frequently recurs, it is likely that you will need additional surgery to remove part of the problematic organ of the digestive tract to end the disease. .\nIn addition to medical methods, patients can reduce symptoms of proctitis through lifestyle changes such as:\nChange your diet: eat bland, eat easily digestible foods; Do not eat spicy, sour or greasy foods; Cut back on dairy products or switch to nut milk products if lactose intolerant; Drink plenty of water but avoid drinking coffee, tea or drinks containing caffeine; You should not drink alcohol\nDuring treatment of proctitis, it is necessary to monitor the disease carefully. Patients not only need to take the full medication as prescribed, but should also abstain from sexual activities to avoid causing irritation. After 1-2 weeks, the patient should return for a check-up to check how much the inflammation has improved. If your symptoms get worse, don't hesitate and see a doctor as soon as possible to avoid more serious illness that can cause complications.",
