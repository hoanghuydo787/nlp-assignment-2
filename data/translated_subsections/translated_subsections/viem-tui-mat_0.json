    "subsection_content": "Cholecystitis is a condition in which the gallbladder becomes inflamed due to bacteria, often occurring in patients with bile duct obstruction. Accordingly, the main task of this organ is to contain digestive fluid (bile). Bile will be released into the small intestine, serving the process of breaking down fat. However, if the bile duct is blocked, bile will become trapped, irritating the gallbladder and causing inflammation. In addition, some other causes may include: abnormal problems in the bile ducts, tumors, infections...\nReferring to the gallbladder, this is a small, pear-shaped organ located on the right side of the abdomen, below the liver, containing bile that is secreted into the small intestine. Inflammation that occurs if not treated promptly can lead to many serious complications, even gallbladder perforation, which is life-threatening.(1)\n1. Acute cholecystitis due to stones\nThis condition accounts for about 90% of cholecystitis cases. Specifically, the flow of bile is blocked, causing bile to stagnate, causing the gallbladder to swell and become painful. The gallbladder is initially sterile but is often susceptible to bacterial infection, mainly E. coli, Klebsiella, Bacteroides, Staphylococus…. Long-term inflammation can cause bile to seep out of the gallbladder wall and spread to surrounding organs and structures, causing symptoms such as peritoneal tenderness or abdominal wall stiffness.\n2. Chronic cholecystitis\nThis condition occurs due to repeated acute cholecystitis, with the main cause also being stones. Accordingly, chronic inflammation may have no main symptoms, and may also present as a more serious acute case. Some complications may occur such as: gangrene, perforation or fistula formation.\n3. Non-calculous cholecystitis\nThis is an inflammatory condition where stones are not found in the bile ducts, accounting for 5 - 10% of all cases and directly related to high mortality rates. Acalculous cholecystitis often occurs in people who are seriously ill, such as men after non-traumatic surgery. Accordingly, this condition is related to many other causes, including: vasculitis, chemotherapy, trauma, burns...\nSymptoms are similar to inflammation caused by stones. However, the likelihood of jaundice is often higher. Depending on each case, the doctor may prescribe ultrasound or computed tomography to determine the abnormal size and mobility of the gallbladder.",
