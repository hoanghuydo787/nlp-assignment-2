After that, the patient may also be prescribed a number of necessary tests, including: (3)\nComplete blood count (CBC) test: This test helps measure the number of white blood cells, if there is an infection, this number will increase.; Complete blood count (CBC) test: This test helps measure the number of white blood cells. If there is an infection, this number will increase.\nLiver function test: This test will help determine the liver's ability to function; Liver function test: This test will help determine the liver's ability to function.\nUltrasound: With this test, images of internal organs inside the body are displayed on a computer screen using high-frequency sound waves. From there, the doctor can check the condition of the liver, gallbladder and blood flow through different vessels.; Ultrasound: With this test, images of internal organs inside the body are displayed on a computer screen using high-frequency sound waves. From there, the doctor can check the condition of the liver, gallbladder and blood flow through different vessels.\nAbdominal X-ray: This test creates detailed images of internal tissues, bones and organs using beams of electromagnetic energy.; Abdominal X-ray: This test creates detailed images of internal tissues, bones, and organs using beams of electromagnetic energy.\nCT scan: This is a test that uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the body, including: bones, muscles, fat, organs... Compared to X-rays, CT scans are more detailed. ; CT scan: This is a test that uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the body, including: bones, muscles, fat, organs... Compared to X-rays, CT scans are more detailed.\nHIDA scan (cholangiography or hepatobiliary scintigraphy): This scan will help check for any abnormal movements (spasms) in the gallbladder as well as blocked bile ducts. With this method, the doctor will inject a radioactive chemical into the vein. The amount of radiation will be very small and harmless, will move into the liver and flow to the gallbladder. At this point, a special scanner will track the chemical as it moves through the organs.

Accordingly, the doctor will use X-rays and a long, flexible endoscope with a light and camera at one end. The tube is inserted into the person's mouth and throat, down the food pipe (esophagus), through the stomach and into the first part of the small intestine (duodenum), finally reaching the bile duct.
