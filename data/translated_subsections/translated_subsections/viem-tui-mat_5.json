Medical treatment\nFor cholecystitis, patients are often prescribed hospitalization for effective monitoring and control. Some methods that can be applied to improve symptoms include:\nStop eating and drinking at first: At first, the person may not be allowed to eat or drink to reduce stress on the inflamed gallbladder.; Stop eating and drinking at first: At first, the person may not be allowed to eat or drink to reduce stress on the inflamed gallbladder.\nFluid infusion: Fluids can be infused into the body through a vein in the arm, helping to replenish water, electrolytes and nutrients for the patient during the fasting period.; Fluid infusion: Fluids can be infused into the body through a vein in the arm, helping to replenish water, electrolytes and nutrients for the patient during the fasting period.\nTake antibiotics to fight infection: If your gallbladder is infected, your doctor may advise you to take antibiotics; Take antibiotics to fight infection: If your gallbladder is infected, your doctor may advise you to take antibiotics.\nPain relievers: Pain relievers may be prescribed to help control pain until inflammation subsides.; Pain relievers: Pain relievers may be prescribed to help control pain until inflammation subsides.\nStone removal procedure: The patient may have to undergo a procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). During this procedure, the doctor will use dye to clarify the image of the bile ducts on the computer, then some tools can be used to remove the stones, preventing bile duct blockage. This procedure is performed when patients with cholecystitis have common bile duct stones.; Stone removal procedure: The patient may have to undergo a procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

This procedure is performed when patients with cholecystitis have common bile duct stones.\nGallbladder drainage: In some cases, such as when gallbladder removal surgery cannot be performed, gallbladder drainage is a procedure that may be performed to eliminate the infection. This procedure will be performed through the skin on the abdomen or by passing the scope through the mouth.; Gallbladder drainage: In some cases, such as when gallbladder removal surgery cannot be performed, gallbladder drainage is a procedure that may be performed to eliminate the infection. This procedure will be performed through the skin on the abdomen or by passing the scope through the mouth.\nWith the above methods, inflammation symptoms are likely to improve within about 2-3 days. However, cholecystitis can still recur. Most cases of inflammation eventually require surgical removal.\n2. Surgical treatment\nWith an inflamed gallbladder, if medical methods do not bring any improvement at all, the doctor may prescribe surgical removal. This is a minimally invasive procedure, with a few small incisions in the abdomen. In some cases, the doctor will make a long incision but this is relatively rare.\nThe timing of surgery depends on the severity of your symptoms and your overall risk of problems during and after treatment. After the gallbladder is removed, bile flows directly from the liver into the small intestine, instead of being stored in the gallbladder as usual. Even without a gallbladder, the patient's body can still digest food.",
