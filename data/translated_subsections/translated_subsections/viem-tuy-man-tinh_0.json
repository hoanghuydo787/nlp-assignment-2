    "subsection_content": "Chronic pancreatitis is a disease caused by prolonged inflammation leading to gradual fibrosis of the pancreatic parenchyma. The pancreas is no longer able to produce digestive enzymes. This condition leads to the loss of the ability to digest and absorb fats (called exocrine pancreatic insufficiency). At the same time, long-term fibrosis of the pancreatic parenchyma leads to impaired production of the hormone insulin (endocrine pancreatic insufficiency). At that time, the patient will have impaired or lost pancreatic function.",
