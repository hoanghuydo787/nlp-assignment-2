    "subsection_content": "1. Abdominal pain\nThe patient has pain in the area above the navel that spreads to the right, left and back. The pain appears infrequently, lasting a few days or longer. After that, the symptoms disappear for a long time, sometimes even several months. Abdominal pain due to chronic pancreatitis often appears after fatty meals and drinking a lot of alcohol.\nAt first, the pain was only dull, tight and burning in the area above the navel, then progressed to cramping pain. The pain increases intensely, with many pain attacks one after another. Pain symptoms can last for many hours. Usually, patients have to sit down to relax their abdominal muscles and relieve pain.(1)\n2. Malnutrition\nBecause of a lot of pain and pain related to eating, especially fatty foods, patients tend to hesitate to supplement food. In addition, because the pancreas can no longer secrete digestive enzymes, it limits the absorption of nutrients. If this condition persists for a long time, the patient will lose weight, even when they still have a good appetite and a normal diet.\n3. Digest steatorrhea\nThe stools of people with chronic pancreatitis often have fatty mucus, pale stool color, unpleasant odor and are liquid and difficult to expel, and the stool easily sticks to the toilet wall. The cause of steatorrhea is a lack of pancreatic enzymes to digest fat.\n4. Jaundice\nPatients with chronic pancreatitis often have jaundice due to pancreatic fibrosis strangulating the common bile duct passing through the head of the pancreas. At first, there may only be dilation of the common bile duct without jaundice. After severe obstruction, it can cause yellowing of the whites of the eyes, jaundice, and dark urine like strong tea.\nSymptoms of digestive disorders such as nausea and vomiting appear when there is pain, but are less obvious. When patients undergo clinical examination, other than pain, they rarely detect any specific signs.",
