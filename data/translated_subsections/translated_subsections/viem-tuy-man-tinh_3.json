    "subsection_content": "Early diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis helps treat and prevent dangerous complications to the patient's health. Commonly prescribed methods for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis include: (2)\n1. Clinical diagnosis\nA common symptom is abdominal pain in the epigastric region spreading to the back. Pain with many levels. This symptom often increases when eating.; Digestive disorders: Loose stools appear in large quantities; Malnutrition: Patients lose weight rapidly. In the late stages, patients may have limb edema and membrane effusion due to malabsorption syndrome; Diabetes: Occurs when the pancreas is more than 85% fibrotic; When the pancreas is inflamed, it shows signs of invasion and pushes on neighboring organs, leading to symptoms such as vomiting and nausea, portal hypertension syndrome and obstructive jaundice.; Abdominal examination: The doctor can feel the tumor above the navel. The tumor may be due to the appearance of pseudocysts and an enlarged pancreas.\n2. Paraclinical testing\nConduct an investigation of the dysfunction of the exocrine pancreas. Some cases also have endocrine dysfunction; Biochemical tests to evaluate the exocrine function of the pancreas include: Secretin stimulation test (secretin_cholecystokinin test). C13 breath test (cholesteryl_(C13) octanoate breath test). Fecal elastase test (faecal elastase test).; Secretin stimulation test (secretin_cholecystokinin test).; C13 breath test (cholesteryl_(C13) octanoate breath test).; Fecal elastase test (faecal elastase test).; Blood test: Results help doctors evaluate nutritional status; Serum proteins are often reduced, especially serum albumin; The test investigates the leakage of enzymes into the blood caused by inflamed pancreatic tissue, examining the ability to produce enzymes. When the pancreas is heavily fibrotic, amylase and lipase do not increase. Tests: blood lipid disorders appear, affecting blood sugar; Stool test: Results help doctors evaluate the level of mucus and fat in the stool.\n3. Imaging diagnosis\nPatients may be prescribed X-ray, ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. Thereby, doctors can evaluate the condition of the pancreatic structure, pancreatic duct and surrounding tissues to diagnose chronic pancreatitis.",
