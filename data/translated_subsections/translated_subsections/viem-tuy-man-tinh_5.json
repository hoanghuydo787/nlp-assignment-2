Medical treatment\nPatients need to change their lifestyle: Absolutely do not use alcohol or beer, do not smoke, reduce foods high in fat and starch, especially when there is increased blood fat. Symptoms of steatorrhea will be treated with pancreatic enzyme preparations selected based on high lipase activity. The dose is usually about 25,000- 50,000 lipase units in capsules, taken with meals. Concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole 20 - 60 mg/day) helps reduce lipase inactivation due to acid, thereby improving symptoms of steatorrhea.\nPain secondary to idiopathic chronic pancreatitis can be relieved in some cases by the use of pancreatic enzymes or analgesics. If diabetes is present, the patient needs to be treated in the usual way using insulin.(3)\n2. Surgical treatment\nSurgical methods in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis include:\nSurgery to eliminate pancreatic duct obstruction: This method is performed to drain pseudocysts, relieve pain, and treat complications due to chronic pancreatitis.; Surgery to eliminate pancreatic duct obstruction: This method is performed to drain pseudocysts, reduce pain, and treat complications due to chronic pancreatitis.\nPancreatic duct drainage surgery: This method is indicated to dilate the pancreatic duct or cut the pancreatic tail to connect the pancreas - jejunum to reduce pain for the patient.; Pancreatic duct drainage surgery: This method is indicated to dilate the pancreatic duct or cut the pancreatic tail to connect the pancreas - jejunum to reduce pain for the patient.\nPancreatectomy: Partial or total pancreatectomy is considered the final treatment method for patients with severe chronic pancreatitis.
