    "subsection_content": "The treatment of pancreatitis will be based on two types of inflammation: acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis.(6)\n1. Treatment of acute pancreatitis\nDr. Trung said that in the management of acute pancreatitis due to any cause, pain relief and fluid replacement are the two most important fundamental principles. Next is to address the cause (if any) such as reducing blood fat (triglycerides), gallstone intervention, trauma... Antibiotic treatment if there is evidence of infection. And especially consider feeding patients early within 24-72 hours after admission depending on the severity of pancreatitis as well as the ability to tolerate food by mouth or through a gastric tube.\n1.1 Pain relief, fluid replacement\nPain relief: Patients receive active pain relief with painkillers; Fluid replacement: Depending on the severity and accompanying pathology, the patient may be given Ringer lactate solution or Sodium chloride 0.9%. Note, patients need to closely monitor urine output, vital signs, and blood tests such as red blood cell volume and blood urea concentration to determine the exact amount of fluid needed, avoiding too much or not enough fluid.\n1.2 Feed early\nDepending on the severity and tolerability, patients with acute pancreatitis are recommended to be fed early within 24-72 hours after admission. If the patient cannot tolerate oral intake, feeding can be done through a nasogastric tube. In cases where early feeding is contraindicated, such as paralytic ileus, intestinal obstruction, etc., intravenous feeding can be used instead.\nDr. Trung said that \"early feeding helps prevent dangerous complications such as multi-organ failure and acute necrotizing pancreatitis, which would not be possible if the patient received enteral feeding too late.\"\n1.3 Antibiotics\nOveruse of antibiotics in acute pancreatitis without evidence of infection sometimes delays fluid resuscitation and treatment of the primary cause in acute pancreatitis emergency. All recommendations for the treatment of acute pancreatitis do not agree on the use of antibiotics for the purpose of preventing infection.\n2. Treatment of chronic pancreatitis\nPatients with chronic pancreatitis often have symptoms and/or complications such as chronic abdominal pain, malnutrition, steatorrhea due to pancreatic enzyme deficiency, diabetes due to endocrine pancreatic enzyme disorders, and even pancreatic cancer.\nTherefore, treatment of chronic pancreatitis focuses mainly on improving symptoms, helping to prevent disease progression as well as promptly detect and treat complications of pancreatic cancer.\nTreat the cause such as stopping alcohol, smoking, gallstones, hypertriglyceridemia... to prevent recurrence of pancreatitis.; Pain relief if patients with chronic pancreatitis have a lot of pain. You can use medicine or endoscopy to remove pancreatic stones, or even surgically intervene with pancreatic stones if necessary to reduce pain.; Supportive treatment of pancreatic enzymes in patients with evidence of exocrine pancreatic enzyme deficiency.; Treat with insulin if the patient has diabetic complications, and periodically monitor to detect pancreatic cancer early.",
