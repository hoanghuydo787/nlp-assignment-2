(first)\nIllustration of the thyroid gland\nInflammation can occur in three stages:\nStage of thyrotoxicosis (hyperthyroidism): Thyrotoxicosis is a condition in which the thyroid gland becomes inflamed and secretes excessive hormones.; Hypothyroidism/hypothyroidism stage: After a period of secreting too much hormone, the thyroid gland will not have enough hormones to release. This leads to thyroid hormone deficiency or hypothyroidism.; Euthyroid/recovery phase: Immediately after the toxic phase, the thyroid may temporarily stabilize before entering the hypothyroid phase, or may completely return to normal as the thyroid recovers from inflammation .",
