    "subsection_content": "Based on the cause, symptoms and duration of the disease, thyroiditis is divided into the following types: (2)\nAcute thyroiditis\nAcute thyroiditis is an acute inflammation of the thyroid gland caused by pyogenic bacteria. This is a relatively rare type of thyroid inflammation caused by bacteria or infectious organisms.\nSubacute thyroiditis\nSubacute granulomatous thyroiditis\nSubacute granulomatous thyroiditis is also known as de Quervain thyroiditis. This painful condition is most likely caused by a virus, often secondary to mumps, measles, or influenza.\nSubacute lymphocytic thyroiditis\nSubacute lymphocytic thyroiditis is painless, also known as silent thyroiditis. The disease can occur in both men and women, but is more common in women. If the thyroid gland is inflamed without painful symptoms in postpartum women, it is called postpartum thyroiditis.\nFor this condition, the patient's thyroid function usually stabilizes 12 - 18 months after the first symptoms appear. However, there are still cases where the disease leads to complications of hypothyroidism, forcing the patient to require long-term treatment.\nChronic thyroiditis\nHashimoto's disease\nImmune system disorders cause Hashimoto's disease\nHashimoto's disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease caused by a disorder of the immune system (3). In this disease, the immune system produces antibodies that attack thyroid cells. The destruction process takes place silently, making it impossible for most patients to detect in the early stages. This is the most common type of thyroid inflammation, with the incidence rate in women being 7-8 times higher than in men, usually occurring in the 30-50 age group.\nRiedel thyroiditis\nRiedel thyroiditis is also known as chronic sclerosing invasive thyroiditis. This is an extremely rare form of inflammation, mainly occurring in middle-aged or older women. In this case, the dense fibrous tissue causes the thyroid gland to harden and gradually lose its function.\nThe disease can be accompanied by fibrosis in other areas of the body such as mediastinal fibrosis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, retrobulbar fibrosis...",
