    "subsection_content": "Symptoms of thyroiditis depend on the type of inflammation and the stage of the disease.\nAcute inflammation\nPatients have fever, chills, headache, fatigue; The front neck area is painful and swollen. Severe pain can spread to the ear or lower jaw, causing difficulty swallowing and speaking; Abscesses may form in the thyroid area.\nSubacute inflammation\nSubacute granulomatous thyroiditis\nAcute phase: Symptoms of the acute phase can last from 4 to 8 weeks. First, patients often have symptoms such as muscle pain, mild fever, malaise and sore throat. After that, the thyroid gland begins to hurt, usually on one side, then spreads to the area under the jaw or to the ear, causing difficulty breathing and swallowing. Patients may also experience symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as weight loss, rapid heartbeat, excessive sweating, fear of hot weather, etc.; Euthyroid phase: Transient 1-2 weeks; Hypothyroidism stage: Usually lasts for weeks, months or may be permanent. At this time, the thyroid gland is usually painless and firm. Patients may experience some symptoms of hypothyroidism such as fatigue, constipation, dry skin, difficulty concentrating...; Immediately after the hypothyroidism stage, the patient enters the next stage which is the recovery stage. The thyroid gland shrinks, the pain no longer exists, and the thyroid condition gradually returns to normal.\nSubacute lymphocytic thyroiditis\nHyperthyroidism stage: The goiter is diffusely large and painless. Patients experience symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as nervousness, palpitations, increased sweating, weight loss despite eating normally, even eating more than before...; Euthyroid phase: This is the stage where the thyroid gland has gradually released all its hormones. Goiter shrinks.; Hypothyroidism stage: After the euthyroid stage, about 25 - 40% of patients move to the hypothyroid stage. The thyroid gland becomes firm and shrinks, the patient may experience symptoms of hypothyroidism such as slow pulse, poor cold tolerance, dry skin...\nChronic inflammation\nHashimoto's thyroiditis\nGoiter: Goiter is moderately large, painless. The tumor can compress the neck area, causing a feeling of suffocation and choking. Systemic symptoms: Most patients have no symptoms in the early stages. In the late stages, patients often experience symptoms of hypothyroidism such as fear of cold, constipation, slow pulse...\nRiedel thyroiditis\nGoiter:  The neck enlarges over many years, painlessly, gradually causing compression, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing. The thyroid gland is large, hard as wood, the tumor invades the surrounding area, and can be combined with retroperitoneal, mediastinal, and retrobulbar fibrosis; Systemic symptoms: No obvious manifestations. Some patients may have progressive symptoms of hypothyroidism.",
