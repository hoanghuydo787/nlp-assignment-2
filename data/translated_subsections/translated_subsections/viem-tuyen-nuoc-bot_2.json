    "subsection_content": "The most common inflammation of the salivary glands is caused by viruses (Mumps virus, HIV, Coxsackievirus, Parainfluenza types 1 and 2, Herpes virus, influenza A virus...). In addition, inflammation of the salivary glands can occur due to bacteria or fungi. The bacteria that commonly causes salivary gland inflammation is Staphylococcus aureus, other bacteria include streptococcus bacteria, Coliform bacteria\nSalivary gland infections often begin with reduced saliva flow or blockage in the gland. Blockage can create conditions for germs to enter and multiply, causing local inflammation. When inflamed, the salivary glands tend to secrete less saliva or cause secretions to accumulate in the ducts. This continues to increase the concentration of bacteria or viruses in saliva.(2)\nSalivary gland obstruction can be caused by factors such as: Salivary gland stones; salivary duct is kinked; tumor; Abnormal formation of salivary glands, scarring and narrowing of the glandular ducts.\nMeanwhile, the condition of reduced salivary glands often comes from the following factors: Age, usually from 50-60 years old; people who have just undergone surgery; intraoral radiotherapy; have Sjögren's disease; suffer from dry mouth and dehydration; suffering from eating disorders, malnutrition, weak immunity; taking antihistamines, diuretics, beta blockers, sedatives, antidepressants, antipsychotics and other medications for other psychiatric treatments; CKD; Breathing through your mouth when sleeping, stress, oral thrush, diabetes...\nSalivary gland inflammation is most commonly caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus.",
