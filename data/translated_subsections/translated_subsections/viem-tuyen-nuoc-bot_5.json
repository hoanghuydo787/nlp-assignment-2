To differentiate between some possible causes of enlarged salivary glands, your doctor may use other tests including:\nBiopsy: Performed by taking a sample of salivary gland tissue and examining it under a microscope. Endoscopy: Performed by inserting an endoscope with a very small camera into the salivary ducts to observe. X-ray: Indicated in cases where the doctor cannot make a diagnosis during a physical examination. X-rays may be performed after using contrast that can be seen on the X-rays that have been injected into the salivary glands and ducts. Computed tomography (CT), ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Indicated in cases of suspected infection to identify inflammation. Culturing pus from a salivary duct: If your doctor is able to squeeze pus from an inflamed salivary duct, the bacteria will be cultured in the laboratory. Blood test: To detect increased amylase in blood and urine, decreased white blood cells, decreased neutrophils if inflammation is caused by a virus, or increased neutrophils for bacterial causes.; Biopsy: Performed by taking a sample of salivary gland tissue and examining it under a microscope.; Endoscopy: Performed by inserting an endoscope with a very small camera into the salivary ducts to observe.; X-ray: Indicated in cases where the doctor cannot make a diagnosis during a physical examination.
