Because in these subjects, the infection can become severe and has the risk of causing complications that adversely affect health as mentioned above.\nAccording to Dr. Thuy Hang, for the treatment of salivary gland inflammation in general, it should be done on the principles of pain relief, anti-inflammation, and anti-infection. Accordingly, treatment recommendations according to each specific level of inflammation are as follows:\nIf the infection is caused by bacteria: Use antibiotics to treat the bacteria. Note that when using antibiotics, you need to have a specialist's prescription and take the full dose. Do not arbitrarily stop taking the medication midway to avoid antibiotic resistance, making future treatment difficult. (3 ) If the infection is viral: monitor or use antiviral medication if necessary. If there is an abscess or collection of pus: An incision is needed to drain the pus. In cases where inflammation due to obstruction is caused by salivary gland stones, gentle massage of the obstructed area can be used to remove the stones. In case of obstruction due to kinks in the salivary glands: Surgery can be performed to repair or remove kinks or narrowed ducts that affect the flow of saliva. If the salivary gland infection originates from an autoimmune condition: The patient needs treatment to stabilize the immune system and improve resistance, such as increasing nutrition after surgery or treating diabetes.; If the infection is caused by bacteria: Use antibiotics to treat the bacteria.

If salivary stones are blocking the glands and contributing to infection, the person may need endoscopy to remove the stones so the infection does not recur. In cases of large salivary stones, open surgery to remove the salivary glands will be performed.\nIn addition, Dr. Thuy Hang gives additional instructions on how to treat salivary gland inflammation at home for mild infections.\nDrink a lot of water.
