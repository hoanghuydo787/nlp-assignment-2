    "subsection_content": "For acute prostatitis, your doctor will initially ask some questions regarding your medical history and conduct a physical examination, to determine the underlying cause. Some diagnostic methods that can then be performed include:\nRectal prostate examination: During this procedure, the doctor will wear gloves and gently insert a lubricated finger into the rectum to feel the prostate located in front. If this area is inflamed due to bacteria, easily recognizable signs are swelling, tenderness, and pain. During the examination, the doctor may also massage the prostate to force a small amount of fluid into the urethra. In addition, the fluid can also be taken for testing to check for signs of infection (stained, examined, or cultured to look for pathogenic bacteria); Blood test: Blood test is done to determine bacteria in the blood (if high fever is present).; Urine sediment analysis: This method will help doctors detect blood, white blood cells or bacteria in urine.; Fresh examination of urethral fluid: This method is performed to identify some types of bacteria, fungi, protozoa... that commonly cause diseases in the genital and urinary organs.; Urodynamic testing: The goal is to identify some problems related to the bladder.; Cystoscopy: The doctor performs a cystoscopy to examine the inside of the urethra and bladder to identify specific lesions that cannot be seen through external examination.",
