    "subsection_content": "1. Chronic prostatitis caused by bacteria\nChronic bacterial prostatitis is caused by the development of acute bacterial prostatitis. (4)\nAfter bacteria enter the human prostate through the genital tract, urethra or changes in the immune system. Bacteria will begin to attack the prostate wall, causing swelling and inflammation. Because symptomatic prostatitis is unlikely to go away on its own.\nThe disease will develop into chronic prostatitis if the patient does not receive timely treatment, prolonging the duration of the disease. In addition, chronic bacterial prostatitis can also be caused by repeated acute illness. Continuous, repeated damage will weaken the prostate's function.\nChronic prostatitis can originate from cystitis, urinary catheter inflammation or infection from other nearby organs.\nCauses of chronic prostatitis include:\nBacterial infections such as E.coli, cholera proteus, mycoplasma fungus, etc. Normally, bacteria will enter the prostate through the urinary tract. This is an organ with many bacteria that are harmful to human health.; Immune system reactions or sudden changes in the immune system can cause infections in humans. From there, it leads to urinary tract infections, prostatitis and chronic prostatitis; Damage caused by surgery, specifically post-operative or endoscopic infection. This is a complication that occurs in patients undergoing surgery or endoscopy, although there are very rare cases of complications after surgery. Infection is the most common complication in the above cases. And urinary tract infection is one of the complications after surgery. This causes reverse infection and chronic prostatitis.\n2. Chronic prostatitis with chronic pelvic pain syndrome\nChronic prostatitis with pelvic pain syndrome is considered a type of prostatitis of unknown cause. Because the direct cause of pelvic pain syndrome has not yet been determined.\nAnd because the cause cannot be identified, chronic prostatitis with pelvic pain syndrome is also more difficult to treat.\nCauses of chronic pelvic pain may be related to the following health conditions:\nPsychological stress; Neurological disorders; Immune disorders; Urinary tract infections; Complications of lower abdominal surgery; Endocrine disorders",
