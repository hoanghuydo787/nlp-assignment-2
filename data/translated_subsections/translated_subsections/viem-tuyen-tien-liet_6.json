In particular, the doctor will examine the prostate with a finger through the rectum to evaluate the characteristics of prostatitis or Detection of potentially malignant lesions and paraclinical tests.\n1. Urine test\nUrine analysis looks for bacteria, blood, and other factors that are at risk for prostatitis or are caused by prostatitis.\n2. Urine culture\nUrine culture in the laboratory helps find the type of bacteria that has attacked the prostate and predict the appropriate antibiotic to treat.\n3. Rectal examination\nThis examination is performed by a specialist to evaluate the size, density, and elasticity of the prostate. In some cases, the doctor may aspirate pus from the prostate for culture and antibiotic testing.\n4. Urethral fluid culture\nSimilar to urine culture, urethral fluid culture in the laboratory also helps identify bacterial strains and develop appropriate treatment regimens.\n5. Cystoscopy\nCystoscopy helps doctors examine the lower urinary tract to screen, diagnose, monitor the situation and evaluate treatment results. Or the abscess can be ablated and destroyed if the prostatitis is abscessed.\n6. Transrectal ultrasound\nThis is one of the popular imaging diagnostic methods, helping to determine prostate size, condition of parenchymal tissues, tumors, inflammation... In addition to helping determine the risk of prostatitis, ultrasound can also help determine the risk of prostatitis. can help detect the early signs of cancer in this part.\n7. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nMagnetic resonance imaging allows a comprehensive examination of the prostate, in order to assess the risk of infection for appropriate intervention.; In some cases, the doctor may prescribe the patient to perform urodynamics, blood tests to find prostate-specific antigen (PSA), etc. to serve the diagnosis of prostatitis.",
