    "subsection_content": "Symptoms of sphenoid sinusitis are diverse, similar to the symptoms of typical sinus infections. However, the commonly reported symptoms of patients with sphenoid sinusitis are:\n1. Headache\nSphenoid sinusitis often presents with atypical headaches of varying intensity and location. In particular, the patient does not respond to pain medication and the pain gets worse when moving the head.\nHeadaches can be located in the parietal, forehead, temporal, periorbital and occipital regions. The most common are headaches in the retroorbital and occipital areas, accounting for 72%.\nThese different locations are due to the sensory innervation of the sphenoid sinus, which is innervated by the trigeminal nerve and afferent fibers from the sphenopalatine ganglion.\n2. Visual disorders\nLocal visual disturbances such as double vision, progressive unilateral vision loss and reduced visual field on the damaged side. Ophthalmic symptoms are present in approximately 21% of patients with isolated sphenoid sinusitis.\n3. Rhinitis\nNasal manifestations of the disease include postnasal drip and nosebleeds.\n4. Earache\nEar pain, drowsiness, and meningitis-like symptoms may also occur. However, sphenoid sinusitis can be completely asymptomatic until complications appear.(1)",
