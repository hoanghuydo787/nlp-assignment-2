These types of infections often develop as a result of a pre-existing sinus condition, starting from a viral infection, such as the common cold or flu.\nSphenoid sinusitis can also be triggered by allergens or a fungal infection that develops into a sinus infection, spreading into the sphenoidal cavities.\nIf left untreated, the irritated tissues in the sinuses can provide an ideal environment for bacteria to grow.",
