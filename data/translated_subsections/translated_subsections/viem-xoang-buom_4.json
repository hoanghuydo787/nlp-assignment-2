    "subsection_content": "With respect to the skull base, the sphenoid sinus structure is located centrally, at the junction of the anterior and middle cranial fossae, surrounded by important vascular and neural structures.\nAlthough relatively rare, complications of inflammation and infection from sphenoid sinusitis result from the direct spread of the disease to surrounding tissues. Or it results from thrombophlebitis spreading through valveless veins connecting the paranasal sinuses to the orbit, cavernous sinus, and intracranial cavity.\nThe spread of inflammation and/or infection from the sphenoid sinus to the orbit and cavernous sinus causes 5 complications including:\nOrbital cellulitis;; Subdural abscess;; Orbital abscess;; Cavernous sinus thrombosis.\nIn cavernous sinus thrombosis, infected aneurysms account for only about 2-5% of all intracranial aneurysms. Intracranial aneurysms can also be caused by fungal infections, causing “mycotic” or true fungal aneurysms, although the causative agent is usually bacterial.\nIntracranial and vascular complications of sphenoid sinusitis are rare, accounting for less than 1% of cases, but have a high incidence.\nAccording to the International Classification of Diseases, intracranial complications include:\nEpidural abscess;; Brain abscess;; Meningitis;; Cavernous sinusitis, other intracranial venous sinusitis, or osteomyelitis.\nMost intracranial complications are completely reversible with effective treatment. However, the risk of death can still occur in cases of intracranial complications due to bacterial sinusitis.",
