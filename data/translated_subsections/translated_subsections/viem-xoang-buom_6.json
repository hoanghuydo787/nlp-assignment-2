    "subsection_content": "If initial assessment via CT-scan shows complete opacification of the sphenoid bone with clinical manifestations, the patient can be treated medically. The most common medical method of treating sphenoid sinusitis is using saline, antibiotics, and topical corticosteroids. Surgical intervention in cases where medical treatment is ineffective.\n1. Medical treatment\nSphenoid sinusitis is typically treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to fight infection by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is often at the root of the condition. Many patients also use over-the-counter medications, nasal sprays, and decongestants to help relieve symptoms of sphenoid sinusitis, such as headaches, postnasal drip, and sinus pressure.\nSome symptoms of sphenoid sinusitis, such as postnasal drip and sinus congestion, can be treated with a nasal nebulizer. Nasal nebulizers help deliver prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, and saline solutions deep into the sinuses to treat, improve symptoms, and reduce pain and irritation.\nBecause sphenoid sinusitis has the potential to develop serious neurological symptoms and physical complications, it is important to be diagnosed early and begin treatment immediately.\nWhen detected early, most patients with sphenoid sinusitis respond well to treatment. However, if the infection does not improve or becomes severe, it may be necessary to switch to surgical treatment to prevent dangerous complications.\n2. Surgery\nThere are several approaches to treating sphenoid sinusitis. The most popular among them are transnasal endoscopy, transseptal endoscopy and transethmoid endoscopy.(2)\nIn cases of isolated pathology of the sphenoid sinus, the first two methods are considered the most optimal, since this method does not require opening of other sinus structures.\nThere is a rare group of patients with isolated sphenoid sinusitis who have a high rate of recurrence, even when surgical interventions have been successful. For this group of patients, it is necessary to expand the sphenoid bone and remove all fungal tissue, polyps or mucus.\nSurgery to treat sphenoid sinusitis at Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City",
