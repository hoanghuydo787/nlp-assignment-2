    "subsection_content": "The sinuses function to filter pollutants, microorganisms, dust and other antigens. The sinuses drain into the nasal cavity through small channels called sinus openings. The anterior ethmoidal, maxillary, and frontal sinuses drain into the medial fissure, creating an area of ​​obstruction known as the ostium complex.\nThe posterior ethmoid sinus and sphenoid sinus drain into the superior fissure. Tiny hairs called “cilia” line the mucous membranes of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx, and work together to circulate mucus and filter debris, then guide it to nasopharynx and pharynx.\nRhinosinusitis occurs when the sinuses and nasal passages cannot effectively clear these antigens, leading to inflammation.\nSinusitis is often caused by 3 main factors:\nSinus ostium obstruction: Often has an anatomical cause such as a tumor or deviated septum;; Dysfunction of cilia: Such as Kartagener syndrome;; Thick sinus secretions: Cystic fibrosis.\nThe most common cause of temporary blockage of these drainage areas is local edema due to upper respiratory tract infection (URI) or nasal allergies. Both of these conditions lead to rhinosinusitis.\nWhen this happens, bacteria can survive, reach, and multiply in the paranasal sinuses. Serious complications can occur when a sinus infection spreads to surrounding structures, such as the brain and orbit, through veins that do not have valves.\nAdults have 4 pairs of sinuses that develop and are related to each other: maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinus, frontal sinus and sphenoid sinus.(1)\nNewborns only have ethmoid and maxillary sinuses. The ethmoid sinus is separated from the eye socket by only a thin layer of bone. Therefore, orbital infections in young children often arise from the ethmoid sinus. The frontal sinuses do not appear to develop until the child is 5-6 years old and do not fully develop until after puberty. Intracranial complications often arise from the frontal sinuses and therefore occur more frequently in older children or adults. The sphenoid sinus begins to ventilate when a child is 5 years old but does not fully develop until 20-30 years of age.",
