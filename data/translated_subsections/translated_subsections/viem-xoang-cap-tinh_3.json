    "subsection_content": "Acute rhinosinusitis needs to be distinguished from chronic sinusitis to ensure that antibiotics are not overused.\nAccording to M.D. Truong Tan Phat, Department of Otolaryngology, Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, the usual diagnostic criteria for rhinosinusitis in adults is that the patient has at least two main symptoms or one symptom. main accompanied by two or more secondary symptoms.\nThe criteria in children are similar and focus more on signs of runny nose (not stuffy nose).\n1. Diagnostic test for acute sinusitis\nTo diagnose acute sinusitis, your doctor may order tests including:\nBlood tests\nThere is some evidence that elevated ESR and CRP levels in the blood may be related to bacterial infections.\nPurulent fluid culture\nEndoscopic aspirate culture ≥10 CFU/mL is considered the gold standard. However, this test is rarely used due to poor correlation with endoscopic aspirate. Endoscopic aspiration may be useful in refractory cases or in patients allergic to many antibiotics.\n2. Diagnostic imaging\nImaging for acute sinusitis is not necessary unless there is clinical suspicion for a complication or an alternative diagnosis.\nX-ray\nX-rays are usually not helpful in detecting inflammation. Although they can show airborne fluid levels, they do not help distinguish between viral and bacterial causes.\nSinus CT scan\nIf complications are suspected or in the differential diagnosis, or if the patient has recurrent acute infections, a sinus CT scan is recommended. This technique is used to evaluate bone, soft tissue, teeth, or other anatomical abnormalities or the presence of chronic sinusitis.\nSinus CT can show air-fluid levels, opacities, and inflammation. Sinus mucosa thickness over 5 mm is a sign of inflammation. It can also effectively evaluate bone erosion or destruction. However, these findings are not helpful in distinguishing between viral and bacterial causes.\nMRI scan\nThis technique provides more detail than sinus CT. It helps evaluate soft tissue or clarify a tumor. Therefore, MRI may be useful to determine the extent of complications in cases of intracranial extension of sinusitis.\nDiagnosis of sinus diseases using a modern CT scanner at Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City\n3. Differential diagnosis\nIt is most important to differentiate between viral and bacterial acute rhinosinusitis. Allergic rhinitis is also a common condition that needs to be clarified. Fungal infections can also cause rhinosinusitis.\nInvasive fungal sinusitis is a serious infection more common in immunocompromised patients, with a high risk of death.\nOther less common diagnoses to consider in the differential diagnosis include:\nNasal foreign body;; Tonsil;; Structural abnormalities: deviated septum, sinus tumors;; Disorders affecting biliary function: primary biliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis;; Referred pain: tooth infection or abscess;; Acute respiratory failure.",
