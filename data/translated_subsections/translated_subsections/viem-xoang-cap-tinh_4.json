    "subsection_content": "Complications of acute sinusitis are rare, occurring in about 1/1000 cases. Sinus infections can spread to the eye socket, bones, or intracranial cavity. These complications can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality.\nComplications include:\nCellulitis;; Orbital cellulitis;; Subperiosteal abscess;; Orbital abscess;; Cavernous sinus thrombosis;\nIntracranial complications may also occur. Intracranial complications include:\nSubdural hematoma;; Epidural hematoma;; Meningitis or empyema;; Pott's swelling is a subperiosteal abscess of the frontal bone, often associated with osteomyelitis. Both complications often arise from frontal sinus infection, which spreads hematogenously through the valveless venous system.\nAcute fungal sinusitis can occur in noninvasive and invasive forms. The invasive form can spread to surrounding structures. Early identification of this complication is important to avoid potentially serious consequences.",
