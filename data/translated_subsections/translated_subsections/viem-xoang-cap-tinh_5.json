Topical supportive therapies may also be helpful in the treatment of acute sinusitis.(2)\n1. Medical treatment with antibiotics\nIn the antibiotic treatment of acute sinusitis, there are slight differences between the different expert committee guidelines.\nAmerican Academy of Otolaryngology\nThe American Academy of Otolaryngology's updated 2015 adult sinusitis guidelines recommend amoxicillin with or without clavulanate in adults as first-line therapy. Treatment lasts 5-10 days in most adults. Consideration should be given if symptoms do not subside within 7 days or worsen at any time.\nInfectious Diseases Society of America\nThe Infectious Diseases Society of America guideline on acute bacterial rhinosinusitis recommends amoxicillin with clavulanate in adults as first-line therapy. Treatment lasts for 10-14 days in children and 5-7 days in adults. If symptoms do not decrease after 3-5 days or worsen after 48-72 hours of treatment, re-evaluate.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics Clinic Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Acute Bacterial Sinusitis in Children 18 Years and Older recommends amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as first-line therapy. The duration of treatment is unclear, but treatment can be continued for up to 7 days after symptoms resolve. If symptoms do not decrease or worsen after 72 hours of treatment, the regimen should be reconsidered.\n2. Local treatment support measures\nNasal spray\nThese are the most common recommendations in treatment guidelines for acute sinusitis. Steroid nasal sprays can help reduce mucosal swelling and congestion, making the patient more comfortable. Additionally, rinsing your nose with saline can also help reduce congestion.\nAntihistamines\nThe use of antihistamines is not recommended unless there is a clear allergic component because they have the potential to thicken nasal secretions.\nSurgery\nIf acute invasive fungal sinusitis is suspected, the patient can undergo surgical intervention for thorough treatment, avoiding the fungus from multiplying and causing dangerous complications.(4)\nEndoscopic sinus surgery is minimally invasive, limits bleeding and heals quickly at Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City",
