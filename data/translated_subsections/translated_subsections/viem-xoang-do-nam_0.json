Fungi that grow on the sinus lining will cause infection and blockage of the sinuses.

Fungi that grow on the sinus lining will cause infection and blockage of the sinuses. Fungal sinusitis will most likely develop into chronic sinusitis.(1)\nMycetoma: Usually caused by Aspergillus fungus and is most common in the maxillary sinus. The fungus accumulates in the sinuses and forms clumps or masses that gradually increase in size and can block the sinuses. In this form, patients often have a stuffy nose, but the symptoms are nonspecific and may have accompanying nasal polyps.; Mycetoma: Usually caused by Aspergillus fungus and is most common in the maxillary sinus.

In this form, patients often have a stuffy nose, but the symptoms are nonspecific and may have accompanying nasal polyps.\nSinusitis caused by saprophytic fungi: Fungi grow on the mucus layers in the nose, detected when the pus contains scales containing fungi. Usually causes no or few symptoms. When removing the pus and removing the scabs, the fungus is also removed.; Sinusitis caused by saprophytic fungi: Fungi grow on the mucus layers in the nose, detected when the pus contains scales containing fungi.

Sinusitis caused by invasive fungi\nAcute (Fulminant) Invasive Fungal Sinusitis: Is the most aggressive form of invasive fungal sinusitis. Common in immunocompromised people such as cancer patients, chemotherapy patients or after organ transplants, sometimes in healthy people. Infection occurs rapidly when fungi from the paranasal sinuses destroy blood vessels, causing necrosis, bone erosion, and spread to the eyes or brain, causing blindness or death. Further infections such as cavernous sinus, carotid artery, etc. can also occur.(2); Acute (Fulminant) Invasive Fungal Sinusitis: Is the most aggressive form of invasive fungal sinusitis.

People with diabetes are at high risk of developing this form of the disease, or sometimes it occurs in people with a history of chronic sinusitis.; Chronic Invasive Fungal Sinusitis: This condition is similar to acute invasive fungal sinusitis but is chronic, usually lasting more than 12 weeks. People with diabetes are at increased risk of developing this form of the disease, or sometimes it occurs in people with a history of chronic sinusitis.\nGranulomatous invasive fungal sinusitis (GIFS): This is a rare type of fungal sinusitis often accompanied by unilateral proptosis, which occurs when the body has an immune response to the fungus, i.e. the system The immune system attacks the nasal mucosa and destroys nasal tissue. It is usually caused by Aspergillus flavus.; Granulomatous invasive fungal sinusitis (GIFS): This is a rare type of fungal sinusitis often accompanied by unilateral proptosis, which occurs when the body has an immune response to the fungus, i.e. the system The immune system attacks the nasal mucosa and destroys nasal tissue.
