    "subsection_content": "The sinus system in the human body includes: maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinus, frontal sinus and sphenoid sinus. In particular, the maxillary sinuses are sinus cavities located on both sides of the cheekbones and around the eyes. The inside of the sinus cavity is covered by a layer of mucous membrane. When this mucosal layer is invaded by bacteria from the outside, causing inflammation, irritation, swelling, edema and pus, it will lead to maxillary sinusitis.(1)\nAccording to M.D. Huynh Thanh Kieu - Head of General Internal Medicine Department of Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, maxillary sinusitis is the most common type of sinusitis today. The disease often occurs when the surrounding environment and weather change. The question is, is maxillary sinusitis dangerous? If not treated promptly, acute maxillary sinusitis will turn into a chronic stage, accompanied by dangerous health complications.\nThe maxillary sinus is a location that is very susceptible to bacterial and fungal attacks, for example, there is fungal maxillary sinusitis.",
