    "subsection_content": "In addition to clinical symptoms, to diagnose and evaluate the condition of maxillary sinusitis, the doctor may prescribe methods such as: nasal endoscopy, nasal ultrasound, X-ray, CT scanner. sinuses, allergy tests...\n1. Take X-rays\nSinus X-ray is a fairly common method of diagnosing maxillary sinusitis. The results obtained from the scanning process will be a solid basis, helping doctors observe specific and detailed conditions inside the sinus cavities. This helps to identify the condition of the maxillary sinus, frontal sinus and nasal cavity.\n2. Nasal endoscopy\nNasal endoscopy is a technique that uses a probe combined with a camera system and light source to penetrate directly into the nooks and crannies of the nose. Thanks to magnifying glasses with different tilts, this technique will help doctors observe images inside the nasal turbinate in the most intuitive and detailed way. From there, we can provide the most accurate diagnosis of sinusitis.\nEarly diagnosis of maxillary sinusitis using nasal endoscopy will help treat maxillary sinusitis effectively.\n3. Culture nasal and sinus fluid samples\nThis is a rarely performed method, because accurate bacterial culture requires a sample obtained by sinus endoscopy or through the sinus; Bacteria culture of purulent fluid flowing through the nose is considered insufficient. This method of bacterial culture is usually only performed when antibiotic treatment is ineffective, or in immunocompromised patients and some hospital-acquired infections cause sinusitis.",
