If not treated promptly and properly, maxillary sinusitis can cause dangerous complications, negatively affect the patient's health and even threaten the patient's life. Below are some typical complications of maxillary sinusitis on organs:\nRespiratory tract: The three respiratory organs, ear, nose, and throat, are interconnected. If not treated promptly, the sinus infection has the risk of spreading and affecting the remaining organs. Some respiratory complications caused by sinusitis include: chronic pharyngitis, otitis media, lower respiratory tract inflammation and laryngitis.; Respiratory tract: The three respiratory organs, ear, nose, and throat, are interconnected. If not treated promptly, the sinus infection has the risk of spreading and affecting the remaining organs. Some respiratory complications caused by sinusitis include: chronic pharyngitis, otitis media, lower respiratory tract inflammation and laryngitis.\nEyes: Because the maxillary sinuses are sinus cavities located near the eye sockets, when this sinus area becomes infected, it will affect the patient's vision. Specifically, harmful agents in the sinus cavity will follow the blood vessels to the eye and cause inflammation such as: periorbital connective tissue inflammation, optic neuritis, lacrimal sac abscess and abscess. eyelid.; Eyes: Because the maxillary sinuses are sinus cavities located near the eye sockets, when this sinus area becomes infected, it will affect the patient's vision. Specifically, harmful agents in the sinus cavity will follow the blood vessels to the eye and cause inflammation such as: periorbital connective tissue inflammation, optic neuritis, lacrimal sac abscess and abscess. eyelid.\nBones: When maxillary sinusitis becomes severe, it will negatively affect blood circulation in locations around the maxillary sinus. Normally, patients will feel pain and numbness in the eye socket bone near the maxillary sinus. The pain will then spread to the temporal bone, frontal bone and crown of the head.; Bones: When maxillary sinusitis becomes severe, it will negatively affect blood circulation in locations around the maxillary sinus. Normally, patients will feel pain and numbness in the eye socket bone near the maxillary sinus. The pain will then spread to the temporal bone, frontal bone and crown of the head.\nIntracranial: If not treated promptly and properly, bacteria arising from the inflammatory process in the maxillary sinus will attack the skull and cause complications such as: meningitis, meningeal abscess, inflammation of the skull. brain, bone thrombophlebitis. Although this is a rare complication, the danger is very high.; Intracranial: If not treated promptly and properly, bacteria arising from the inflammatory process in the maxillary sinus will attack the skull and cause complications such as: meningitis, meningeal abscess, inflammation of the skull. brain, bone thrombophlebitis. Although this is a rare complication, the danger is very high.\nIs maxillary sinusitis dangerous?\nWhether or not maxillary sinusitis causes many complications that negatively affect health and daily life is a common question of many people. According to MSc. Huynh Thanh Kieu, when maxillary sinusitis develops in the early stages, it usually only has mild, simple symptoms and is not too dangerous. However, if the disease is not recognized properly and there is a delay in diagnosis and treatment, it can turn into a chronic stage, leading to many dangerous complications that even threaten the patient's life. Therefore, patients should not be subjective to avoid negative effects on their health.\nWhen you have symptoms of maxillary sinusitis, you should quickly go to the hospital for diagnosis and active treatment.",
