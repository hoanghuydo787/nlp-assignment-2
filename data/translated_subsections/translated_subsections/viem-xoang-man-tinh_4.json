    "subsection_content": "Chronic sinusitis is diagnosed when at least two of the following four symptoms are present and occur for more than 12 weeks: including cloudy nasal discharge, facial pain, nasal congestion, and decreased sense of smell.\nChronic sinusitis is less common than acute sinusitis. Acute sinusitis can last up to 4 weeks. However, chronic sinusitis lasts 12 weeks or longer. Therefore, other causes also need to be investigated such as gastroesophageal reflux, anatomical variations or structural problems of the nasal cavity. History of immunodeficiency and history of fungal infections are also factors to be considered next.\nIn diagnosing chronic sinusitis, paraclinical tests are often ordered including.\nCT scan or nasal endoscopy: To determine the presence of inflammation. CT is more sensitive but also more expensive than nasal endoscopy. Nasal endoscopy has lower sensitivity and is not of sufficient use in identifying chronic sinusitis.; Bacterial cultures: May be useful during treatment, assisting in providing appropriate antibiotic therapy. If culture fluid is taken, the doctor will perform it through endoscopy to get the most accurate results.",
