    "subsection_content": "According to Dr. Nguyen Thi Huong, sinusitis treatment will focus on adjusting trigger factors, reducing the inflammatory process and eliminating infection. Depending on the patient's condition, the doctor will prescribe medical or surgical treatment.\n1. Medical treatment of chronic sinusitis without nasal polyps\nReduce triggers: Allergy tests can help identify triggers that patients should avoid.; Steroid nasal spray: Should be used with or without saline nasal irrigation. Treatment should only last at least 8-12 weeks according to your doctor's instructions.; Rinsing the nose with saline: Although it is inferior to nasal steroid spray, however, rinsing the nose with saline can help support treatment. Nasal rinsing with large volumes of saline is said to be more effective than nasal sprays.; Antihistamines: Your doctor may prescribe antihistamines if allergic rhinitis is suspected.; Decongestants: May be used for symptom relief.; Antibiotics: Can be used for an appropriate period of time. Oral anti-inflammatory drugs: Can be used, but should not be used regularly.\nNasal corticosteroids should only be used for 8-12 weeks according to your doctor's instructions.\n2. Medical treatment of chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps\nNasal sprays: Chronic sinusitis with polyps is treated with nasal sprays containing corticosteroids.; Oral anti-inflammatory drugs: If severe or unresponsive to treatment after 12 weeks, your doctor may consider a short course of oral steroids.; Leukotriene antagonists: May be considered for treatment.(4)\n3. Surgical treatment\nEndoscopic sinus surgery may be considered for patients who do not respond to medical treatment.\nThe goal of this surgery is to remove abnormal structures, restore drainage and mucus clearance, and widen and clear the sinus openings.\nIf the patient has underlying diseases such as immunodeficiency diseases, diabetes, etc., treatment of the underlying disease is given priority first.(3)\nEndoscopic sinus surgery helps treat chronic sinusitis effectively at Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City\n4. Supports treatment of chronic sinusitis at home\nIn addition to treatment prescribed by the doctor, patients can use measures to help improve sinusitis symptoms at home such as:\nEssential oil steaming: Essential oil steaming therapy is useful for sinusitis patients. However, for patients with sinusitis caused by allergic rhinitis, caution should be exercised when using the therapy. When steaming essential oils, you also need to pay attention to cleaning and changing the water every day to avoid the risk of infection and mold.; Warm compresses: Warm compresses help reduce sinus pain, clear the airways and help dissolve mucus, making it easier to drain.; Yoga: Some yoga therapies are also helpful in supporting the treatment of chronic sinusitis. Bhramari pranayama is a breathing exercise that has been proven effective in supporting the treatment of sinusitis, and patients can apply it.",
