Allergic sinusitis or allergic rhinosinusitis can be a consequence of allergic rhinitis. Due to the adjacent and continuous nature between the nasal mucosa and facial sinuses, when allergic rhinitis is not treated effectively, it can lead to edema of the sinus mucosa, blocking the sinus opening. As a result, sinus fluid retention will occur, causing infection leading to accompanying sinusitis.\nAllergic sinusitis is divided into the following types:\nSeasonal allergic rhinitis (can be cyclical)\nThis condition is also known as seasonal allergic rhinosinusitis. The disease often occurs at certain times of the year.\nYear-round allergic rhinitis (non-cyclical)\nThis is a nasal allergy that occurs year-round, whenever irritants are encountered that lead to inflammation.",
