Although allergic rhinosinusitis is not particularly serious, if the symptoms of the disease persist for a long time, it will cause fatigue, discomfort, immunodeficiency, and affect living, sleep, and learning.( 2)\nSymptoms of allergic rhinosinusitis often include:\nHave an itchy nose;; Continuous sneezing;; Clear runny nose;; Expecting clear phlegm;; Stuffy nose;; May be accompanied by itchy eyes, watery eyes, itchy throat and cough.; When the disease progresses to sinusitis, symptoms may include headache, facial pain and decreased sense of smell.\nMSc.BSc.CKI Ho Van Huu said that symptoms of allergic rhinitis are divided into 2 groups:\n1. Symptoms of the disease are cyclical\nSymptoms of the disease often appear at the beginning of the hot or cold season. Itchy nose, itchy eyes, watery eyes, red eyes, constant sneezing, runny nose and clear mucus are common symptoms.\nIn addition, other symptoms that patients may also experience include burning in the conjunctiva, nasopharynx, feeling of drowsiness, fatigue and heavy head. Symptoms may last from a few days to a week and then resolve. In particular, right at that time, the disease recurs. The disease can last for many years, causing degeneration, edema of the nasal mucosa, hypertrophy of the nasal turbinate, nasal congestion...\n2. Symptoms of the disease are not cyclical\nThis is the most common condition with symptoms such as runny nose, sneezing, runny nose when waking up in the morning, gradually decreasing during the day but recurring when exposed to dust or cold environments. Initially, the nasal discharge is clear, but as time goes on, it becomes thicker and flows in waves. Symptoms are more severe, the patient may sneeze continuously for many hours, leading to secretions and fluid stagnation in the nasopharynx. This leads to the patient having to frequently spit, leading to damage to the nasopharyngeal mucosa. In addition, sinus secretions and fluid retention also lead to nasal congestion, causing patients to often breathe through their mouths, causing pharyngitis or laryngitis.\n“Recurrent or prolonged episodes of allergic rhinosinusitis can lead to hypertrophy and degeneration of the nasal mucosa, forming nasal polyps, causing patients to have a stuffy nose even when they do not have nasal allergies. \", MSc.BS.CKI Ho Van Huu added.\nItchy nose, sneezing, watery eyes, and runny nose are symptoms of allergic rhinosinusitis",
