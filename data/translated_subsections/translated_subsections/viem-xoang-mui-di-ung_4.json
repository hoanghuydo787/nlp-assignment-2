    "subsection_content": "MSc.BSc.CKI Ho Van Huu said that choosing a treatment method for allergic rhinosinusitis will depend on the level of symptoms as well as whether the patient has accompanying sinusitis or not. Before using any medicine, patients need to see an ear, nose and throat specialist at a medical facility to clearly determine the condition they are experiencing. Patients should only use medication when prescribed by a doctor. They should absolutely not buy and use medication on their own to avoid prolonged and complicated illness. Self-medication can even lead to risks due to drug interactions or side effects.\n1. Medicines\nMedications to treat allergic sinusitis often include:\n1.1 Antihistamines\nHelps patients reduce unpleasant symptoms by preventing the secretion of Histamine during allergic reactions. They come in pill form, syrup form, spray form...\n1.2 Corticosteroids\nHelps reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis. The spray is often used in combination with antihistamines in the treatment of allergic rhinosinusitis and can be used long-term with few complications. Short-course oral corticosteroids are recommended for severe symptom onset or intolerance to the spray formulation.\n1.3 Leukotriene inhibitors\nThis medication works to block the action of leukotrienes - a chemical secreted by the immune system that causes symptoms of allergic rhinosinusitis.\n1.4 Decongestants\nAvailable in oral and spray formulations that help improve nasal congestion associated with allergic rhinitis by acting on adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa. Medicines should be used according to doctor's instructions.\n1.5 Cromolyn sodium nasal spray to treat allergic rhinitis\nThis medication helps stabilize mast cells in the body, preventing the production of substances that cause allergic reactions such as histamine. The medicine is most effective when used before exposure to allergens.\n1.6 Immunotherapy (also known as anti-allergy injections)\nThis therapy will be prescribed when medication does not bring positive results or causes too many side effects. In this method, the patient will be periodically injected with a small amount of the allergen into the body for 3-5 years or given medicine containing a small amount of the allergen under the tongue so that it dissolves in the mouth. This helps the body gradually get used to the allergens, thereby gradually reducing symptoms and the need for medication.\nPatients with allergies to cat dander, dust mites or pollen do particularly well with immunotherapy. Immunotherapy may also help prevent the development of asthma in children.\n2. Surgery\nThis method can be prescribed to improve symptoms when there is chronic allergic sinusitis with superinfection, accompanied by turbinate hypertrophy, nasal polyps that do not respond to drug treatment.\nIn addition to treatment methods, patients need to avoid contact with substances that can cause allergies (chemical odors, smoke, cigarettes) and be aware of their own allergies.\nSinus surgery can help treat chronic sinusitis",
