    "subsection_content": "Ethmoid sinusitis is a condition in which the mucosa lining the ethmoid sinuses becomes infected. When inflamed, the sinus cavities will swell, the fluid in the sinuses will stagnate and cannot escape, causing nasal congestion, facial pain, headaches due to lack of brain oxygen and many other symptoms.\nThe sinus is a cavity within the bone that is lined with mucus-secreting mucosa and has an opening (ostium) into the nose. The human body has four pairs of sinuses in four different bones, and the sinuses are named after the bones in which they are present.\nEthmoid sinus: Present inside the ethmoid bone, near the bridge of the nose on both sides; Frontal sinuses: They are seen above the orbit, on each side of the frontal bone.; Sphenoid sinus: Present inside the sphenoid bone, located behind the eye socket; Maxillary sinus: Located in the upper jaw and below the eye socket.\nAll sinuses function as a network with interconnected ducts. Normally, when the ethmoid sinus is inflamed, a similar infection will also occur in other sinuses because the sinuses are connected to each other. This is why frontal sinusitis, ethmoid sinusitis, or sphenoid sinusitis often have similar and nonspecific symptoms.",
