These factors often cause acute ethmoid sinusitis.\nIn addition, there are other risk factors for ethmoid sinusitis, so it is important to find the correct risk factors for ethmoid sinusitis to be able to choose effective treatment methods.\nAccording to MSc.BS.CKI Truong Tan Phat, other risk factors for ethmoid sinusitis include:\nAllergies: Allergens such as pollen, animal hair, chemical fumes from laundry detergent products;; Deviated nasal septum or other abnormalities in the structure of the nose and sinuses;; Nasal polyps;; Cystic fibrosis;; Sarcoidosis: This is a systemic autoimmune inflammatory condition that leads to the formation of tumors;; Wegener's granulomatosis: This is an inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the blood vessels;; Oral infections;; Immunodeficiency such as diabetes, HIV, cancer;; Prolonged smoking;; Hypertension;; Age.",
