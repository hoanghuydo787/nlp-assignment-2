Treatment with medication\nAfter the initial diagnosis, your doctor will prescribe medication to help reduce inflammation and swelling, and open the sinus openings for easy drainage.(3)\nMedications commonly used to treat ethmoid sinusitis include:\nAntibiotics;; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs;; Inhaled or oral corticosteroids;; Other over-the-counter decongestants.\n2. Surgery\nIf medical treatments fail, surgical excision of the sinuses may be indicated. Typically, surgery is recommended for the following cases of ethmoid sinusitis:\nEthmoid sinusitis has spread to the eye socket; Patients who do not respond to drug treatment; Patients with brain abscess complications due to sinusitis; Sinusitis can threaten the patient's life.\nThe goal of surgery is to remove the inflamed ethmoidal bone tissue and at the same time widen the blocked sinus opening. This can only be done by an ENT doctor with extensive experience in sinus surgery.\nEthmoid sinus surgery methods may include:\nFunctional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS)\nDone with the help of an endoscope (a lighted tube with a camera attached) and a microdebrider (a special instrument with a small rotating head). The endoscope and microdebrider are inserted through the nose under anesthesia to remove infected tissue and bone without damaging surrounding healthy tissue.\nTam Anh General Hospital applies endoscopic sinus surgery using the Microdebrider tissue planer and endoscopic septum correction. The method is performed based on lesions from endoscopic images and CT Scan films.\nIn particular, at Tam Anh General Hospital, each type of sinusitis will be treated with a separate, optimal surgical procedure to remove the disease. Patients will also receive active post-operative care to help heal and recover quickly, limiting the risk of post-operative complications and the risk of recurrence. After sinus surgery, patients can leave the hospital after 2-3 days.\nEndoscopic sinus surgery is minimally invasive, wounds heal quickly, and recovery is quick. Photo: Nguyen Phuong\nExternal sinus surgery\nThis procedure is performed by making a hole in the upper jaw of the mouth to access the ethmoid bone. This method is only preferred when other methods of accessing the ethmoid sinuses are difficult to perform.\nThings to note when having ethmoid sinus surgery:\nAfter careful evaluation and examination such as a computed tomography (CT) scan, the surgeon will choose the appropriate approach. It is important to understand the anatomy of the ethmoid bone before choosing a method for several reasons.\nMedical literature summarizes the nasal sinuses as connected cavities, but the ethmoid bone contains 3 to 5 cavities on each side that drain into the nasal cavity. Therefore, care must be taken to target the affected sinuses.\nThe ethmoidal plate of the ethmoid bone forms the base of the skull. The contact of the ethmoid bone with the brain makes it very vulnerable to injury.\nThe nasolacrimal duct also opens into the nose through a hole in the ethmoid bone; any damage to this duct will cause serious damage to tear drainage.",
