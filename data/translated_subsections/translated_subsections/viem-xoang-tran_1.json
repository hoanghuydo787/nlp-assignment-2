    "subsection_content": "Dr. Thuy Hang said, frontal sinusitis can develop when some germs overcome the body's natural defenses or when other factors cause inflammation. The most common causes of frontal sinusitis include:\n1. Viral infection\nUpper respiratory viral infection can lead to frontal sinusitis because it will block the sinus drainage, causing mucus to stagnate in the frontal sinus, leading to inflammation and pain.\nDr. Thuy Hang said that this is a common type of infection. Adults can get a few upper respiratory viral infections each year, and young children can get it more because their immune system is still young. immature.\n2. Bacterial infection\nBacterial infections last longer than viral infections. If the infection is caused by bacteria, the person may need treatment with antibiotics.\nThere are also many cases where after a viral infection, the patient continues to get a bacterial infection. Dr. Thuy Hang explained that such cases are often due to weakened immunity after a viral infection, as well as the sinuses becoming more sensitive and vulnerable, leading to easier access for bacteria. subsequent invasion and disease.\nIf the infection lasts more than 10 or 14 days, it is more likely to be bacterial or to have had a bacterial superinfection rather than a viral one.\n3. Allergy (allergic rhinitis)\nExposure to certain allergens, such as dust, pollen, and animal dander that cause sneezing and itching can lead to inflammation, edema, and mucus buildup in the sinuses. This buildup can clog the nasal sinuses, causing swelling and inflammation of the frontal sinuses.\nFrontal sinusitis with allergic rhinitis can often cause symptoms very similar to regular frontal sinusitis. However, treatment of allergic rhinitis is different from treatment of normal frontal sinusitis, so patients need to be accurately diagnosed and have appropriate treatment.\n4. Deviated nasal septum\nThe nasal septum is like a thin wall of mucosa and cartilage or bone that divides the nasal cavity in two. Normally, the nasal septum divides the nasal cavity into two equally sized nasal cavities.\nAccording to the American Association of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, about 80% of the population has a deviated nasal septum, but most do not affect the functioning of the nose. However, there are also cases where a deviated nasal septum causes difficulty breathing or blocks the sinuses and can cause a frontal sinus infection.\n5. Nasal polyps\nNasal polyps are soft, painless masses that develop in the nose or sinuses. In most cases, nasal polyps are harmless, but if they cause blockage of the sinuses, they can lead to a sinus infection.\nNasal polyps can develop due to:\nInfection recurs again and again; Allergy to environmental irritants such as dust, chemicals, fungi or drugs; Have chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma.",
