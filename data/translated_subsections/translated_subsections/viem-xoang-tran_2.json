    "subsection_content": "According to Dr. Thuy Hang, the symptoms of frontal sinusitis are similar to the symptoms of sinusitis in general, so it is difficult to distinguish between different types of sinusitis even when there are complications.\nCommon symptoms of frontal sinusitis include: (2)\nRunny nose; Feeling of “heaviness” or tightness behind the eyes; Headache; Tired; Sore throat; Muscle pain; Stuffy nose; Reduced sense of smell; Halitosis; Mild fever or high fever\nDr. Thuy Hang said that although frontal sinusitis often has the above symptoms, depending on the cause of the disease, the symptoms may be different. For example, if a person has symptoms of fatigue, fever, muscle aches and sore throat, it is more likely to be a sign of a viral infection than a bacterial infection. Or if symptoms last less than 10 days, the cause of acute frontal sinusitis may be viral. On the contrary, if the symptoms of frontal sinusitis last for more than a few months, the cause of frontal sinusitis may be a deviated nasal septum or nasal polyps.",
