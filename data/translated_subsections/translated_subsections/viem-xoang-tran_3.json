In addition, the Laboratory testing may also be ordered to confirm the diagnosis of frontal sinusitis.\n1.

However, these imaging tests are not recommended for uncomplicated cases of acute sinusitis.\n2. Nasal endoscopy\nThe doctor will use an endoscope with a camera inserted deep inside the nose to examine the condition of the nasal cavity and internal sinuses, thereby providing appropriate treatment.\n3. Lumbar puncture\nThis method of obtaining cerebrospinal fluid helps diagnose meningitis. However, lumbar puncture is only indicated when intracranial complications are suspected, after excluding brain abscess by diagnostic imaging methods.",
