    "subsection_content": "Is frontal sinusitis dangerous? According to Dr. Thuy Hang, frontal sinusitis can cause many dangerous complications, especially complications in the skull.\nComplications of frontal sinusitis include:\n1. Eye complications\nBecause the frontal sinus structure is close to the eye socket, the infection can easily spread into the eye socket, causing inflammation of the nerves and lacrimal sac. If inflammation is not well controlled, it can lead to visual impairment or permanent blindness.\n2. Cranial complications\nComplications of cranial frontal sinusitis include meningitis, brain abscess, epidural abscess, subdural abscess, cerebral edema, cavernous sinus vein thrombosis...\nThe frontal sinus is susceptible to external spread of infection in part because its venous drainage occurs through communicating veins that traverse the posterior wall and communicate with the veins supplying the meninges, cavernous sinuses, and cavernous sinuses. Dural.\nThrombophlebitis of the sinus submucosal venous network spreads through the non-valvular veins into the communicating veins of the frontal bone and then to the meningeal veins. These venous channels may be denser in the developing sinuses, so adolescents and young adults (especially males) are at increased risk for complications of acute frontal sinusitis.",
