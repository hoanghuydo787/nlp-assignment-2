    "subsection_content": "Doctor Thuy Hang answers some questions about frontal sinusitis as follows.\n1. Does frontal sinusitis cause insomnia?\nFrontal sinusitis in particular and sinusitis in general is a condition where the sinuses are blocked, causing inflammation. When inflammation occurs, unpleasant symptoms will appear, especially runny nose, stuffy nose, and cough. Nasal congestion will cause lack of oxygen to the brain and lungs, making it difficult for the patient to breathe and unable to sleep well. In addition, breathing through the mouth due to nasal congestion also causes the patient to have a dry mouth and throat, leading to coughing. Coughing also causes insomnia.\n2. Does frontal sinusitis cause headaches?\nFrontal sinusitis certainly causes headaches for the following two reasons. First, sinusitis often causes nasal congestion and difficulty breathing, leading to poor oxygen flow to the brain. Lack of oxygen to the brain will cause headaches. Second, frontal sinusitis will definitely cause pain in the forehead, especially if there are cranial complications, the headache symptoms will be more obvious.\n3. Where to get tested for frontal sinusitis and how much does it cost?\nComplicated frontal sinusitis can be very much related to the structures adjacent to the sinuses including the skull, ears, nose, nerves, eyes and related to infectious diseases... therefore, the patient should go to the hospital. A reputable medical facility has specialties in Ear, Nose and Throat, Neurology, Eyes, Infectious Diseases... for coordinated diagnosis and effective treatment.\nMedical examination and treatment costs depend on the services of each medical facility or treatment method. Therefore, if you want to know how much it costs to examine frontal sinusitis or how much it costs to treat frontal sinusitis, patients should contact a medical facility directly for specific advice.\nDepartment of Otorhinolaryngology, Tam Anh General Hospital is a unit that examines, diagnoses and treats in-depth diseases of the ear, nose and throat, including frontal sinusitis. With a team of skilled and experienced experts and leading doctors, supported by a system of modern diagnostic and surgical equipment such as: Microdebrider tissue planer from Medtronic (USA), XION endoscope from Germany, COBLATOR system of Smith Nephew (USA)... with close combination between ENT, Respiratory, Cardiology, Pediatrics... help comprehensive and highly effective treatment.\n“Frontal sinusitis has many potential risks of dangerous complications because the sinus structure is located close to the brain and brain nerves. Therefore, patients should not be subjective and let frontal sinusitis last for a long time. If after being treated with conventional methods for about 7 days but the symptoms do not improve, the patient should go to the hospital for examination for effective diagnosis and treatment. In particular, you should not self-treat with antibiotics not prescribed by a specialist. This can cause drug resistance, leading to the risk of antibiotic resistance when treating future infections,\" Dr. Thuy Hang emphasized.",
