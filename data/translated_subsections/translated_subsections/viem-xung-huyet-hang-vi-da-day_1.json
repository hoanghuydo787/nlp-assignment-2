    "subsection_content": "There are many causes of irritation leading to gastric antrum congestion. The disease can originate from one of the following reasons:\nHelicobacter pylori (HP) infection: HP bacteria is a type of bacteria that lives in the mucus layer on the surface of the stomach mucosa. Many people are infected with HP but do not know it because this infection usually does not cause many symptoms. Stomach infections caused by HP bacteria often occur at a young age in areas with high rates of HP infection.(5); Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection: HP bacteria is a type of bacteria that lives in the mucus layer on the surface of the stomach mucosa.
