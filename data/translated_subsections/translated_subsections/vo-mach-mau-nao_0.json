    "subsection_content": "Pairs of carotid and vertebral arteries carry blood, oxygen and nutrients to the brain to feed brain cells. Every minute, about 600-700 ml of blood flows through the carotid arteries and their branches to the brain, while about 100-200 ml of blood flows through the vertebral artery system.\nWhen the cerebral blood vessels are damaged, there is atherosclerosis, trauma, or microscopic damage to the arterial wall, abnormal flow appears at the division of the arteries, etc. The blood will form an aneurysm - that is, an abnormally enlarged area on the brain's blood vessels (like thinned rubber on the wall of a car intestine).\nThese aneurysms are at risk of rupture at any time (the risk of rupture is high or low depending on the pressure on the aneurysm and their location in the brain), and leads to cerebral aneurysm rupture. At this time, blood flow will stimulate brain activity, causing increased intracranial pressure. (first)\nNot only that, when a patient has a ruptured blood vessel in the brain, blood begins to spread and irritate the meninges, releasing harmful products and damaging brain cells. At the same time, there will be a vasoconstriction reflex at the rupture site, (spasm) causing ischemia in the brain area behind the rupture, leading to cerebral infarction. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is life-threatening with a 40% risk of death.\nRupture of blood vessels in the brain causes brain cells to die en masse\nPatients with ruptured blood vessels in the brain can lose consciousness, brain cells and brain tissue die en masse, leading to paralysis of limbs, speech disorders, disability, vegetative life... even can cause death.\nSome statistics show that women and especially those over 55 years old are 1.5 times more likely to have a ruptured cerebral blood vessel than men.",
