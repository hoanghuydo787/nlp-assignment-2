Previously, it was thought that ruptured cerebral aneurysms were hereditary. However, today, based on clinical cases and previously conducted research, it can be seen that aneurysm rupture occurs due to the impact of a number of factors such as: (3)\nHypertension: High blood pressure, especially when it increases suddenly, will affect the aneurysm sacs, causing them to burst. People who eat a lot of salt, have dyslipidemia, are often stressed and anxious, stay up late, don't get enough sleep, etc. are often at higher risk of ruptured brain aneurysms.; Due to cerebral aneurysm: In case of cerebral aneurysm, the aneurysm sac becomes larger, thinner, weaker, has poor elasticity and pressure resistance, so it bursts on its own, leading to rupture of the cerebral blood vessel, threatening the patient's life.; Congenital vascular malformations: Rupture of cerebral blood vessels may appear in children with congenital cerebral vascular malformations, which have abnormalities at the connection sites between cerebral veins and arteries.; Due to vascular disease: Patients using anticoagulants, drugs to treat brain tumors, etc. or other vascular diseases may be at higher risk of cerebral blood vessel rupture. In addition, people with a history of cerebrovascular amyloidosis or cerebral hemorrhage are also more susceptible to cerebral vascular rupture.; Other causes: Besides the above causes, there are many other factors that can increase the risk of cerebral vascular rupture including unhealthy eating habits, use of stimulants, and abnormal changes in blood vessels. weather,…",
