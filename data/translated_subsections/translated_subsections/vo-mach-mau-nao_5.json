    "subsection_content": "Rupture of a cerebral aneurysm is a neurological disease with a high risk of death. Therefore, the earlier the prognosis and emergency treatment, the more complications and mortality due to damaged brain cells will be minimized, helping to improve the effectiveness of treatment and increase the possibility of recovery.\nThe goal of treating a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is to repair the broken blood vessel and the resulting bleeding to save the patient's life and prevent and minimize possible complications. Currently, the two main methods for emergency treatment of patients with ruptured cerebral blood vessels are endovascular intervention and microsurgery. In addition, medical treatment is also needed in cases of cerebral vascular rupture to help patients stabilize their health condition, treat complications and minimize long-term complications.\nDrug treatment\nDrug treatment is often combined before and after surgical methods or endovascular intervention. The patient will be given painkillers to reduce headache symptoms caused by a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.\nIn addition, to limit serious bleeding as well as help control intracranial pressure, the doctor will give the patient medication to control blood pressure before performing surgery. If the patient has a history of epilepsy or is at risk of seizures, antiepileptic drugs may be needed.\nSurgery\nIn cases of ruptured blood vessels in the brain, surgery is needed as soon as possible. The best time is 24 hours before the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm and at the latest within 72 hours. The doctor will rely on the current state of cerebral vascular rupture and cerebral hemorrhage, the patient's age, health condition prognosis and recovery ability to prescribe the appropriate surgical method.\nSurgical methods to treat cerebral vascular rupture include:\nCraniotomy: This technique is performed by cutting the skull bone to create a small hole in the skull. Using a microsurgical microscope, determine the location of the broken blood vessel and use a titanium clip attached to the neck of the aneurysm, removing the aneurysm from the blood flow, helping the blood no longer flow into the aneurysm but can circulate in the aneurysm. normal vascular lumen. The titanium clip is fixed in the patient's brain for life and cannot be removed.\nIn particular, the most modern brain surgery technique today is the Modus V Synaptive robot application. Licensed for the first time in Vietnam, Tam Anh General Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City owns this most modern brain surgery robot, combined with nerve bundle MRI (DTI) technique, allowing doctors to see See images of nerve conduction bundles that correlate with the brain area that is hemorrhaging or damaged. Accordingly, from the simulated surgery using the Robot, the surgeon will avoid damaging nerve conduction bundles during surgery, preserve nerve fiber bundles and healthy brain tissue, and avoid neurological complications. during and after surgery.\nCerebral artery bypass: With cerebral artery bypass, the doctor takes a small vessel in the patient's body (usually from the lower leg or temporal artery) to bypass the ruptured artery, from That creates a new path for blood. A craniotomy to completely block the flow of the artery and the aneurysm and then a cerebral artery bypass will be performed in cases where the ruptured artery is severely damaged or the aneurysm is large and inaccessible.\nCerebral vascular intervention\nPatients with ruptured blood vessels in the brain can receive vascular intervention by:\nCoil button: The doctor will insert the catheter into the artery in the groin and into the blood vessels in the brain to the location of the broken blood vessel. Through it, platinum coils will be inserted to fill the aneurysm. As the aneurysm fills, the flow will gradually decrease and a blood clot will appear and seal the aneurysm.; Placing a cerebral vascular stent: Another technique for treating ruptured cerebral blood vessels is placing a stent in the blood vessel, creating a shelf in the vessel, occluding the aneurysm, and adjusting the flow in the cerebral vessel.\nIn addition, the doctor may give the patient injections of drugs that relax constricted blood vessels to prevent vasospasm. The rate of patients with vasospasm after cerebral vascular rupture is up to 70%. Therefore, to limit the patient's drowsiness, confusion, weakness, etc. when suffering from blood vessel spasm, the doctor will proactively inject blood vessel dilators early.\nDepending on the patient's health condition, the location of the ruptured blood vessel, the size of the ruptured aneurysm and the conditions of the medical facility, the doctor may consider choosing an appropriate treatment method for ruptured cerebral blood vessels.
