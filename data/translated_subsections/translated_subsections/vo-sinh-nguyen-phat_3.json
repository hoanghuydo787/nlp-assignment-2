Using medicine\nIn cases of primary infertility due to disease, doctors often prescribe medication or surgery depending on the condition. Medicines to treat primary infertility according to cause include:\nFertility drugs to stimulate ovulation for infertile women due to ovulation disorders; Medicines to treat problems affecting male fertility such as erectile dysfunction, hormone imbalance...; Antioxidants or special medications to improve sperm quality; Antibiotics treat inflammation, kill bacteria, and create conditions for healthy sperm to move more easily.\n3. Surgery\nDoctors will prescribe patients surgery in cases such as:\nMen: Surgery to treat obstruction of the vas deferens, surgery for varicose veins in the testicles...; Women: Surgery to solve uterine problems such as endometrial polyps, scar tissue in the uterus, uterine septum, etc.\n4. Assisted reproductive methods\nIn cases where medications, surgery, lifestyle changes, etc. have been applied but to no avail, doctors can encourage couples to seek assisted reproductive methods including:\nIn vitro fertilization IVF: With this method, instead of the sperm and egg combining in the female's fallopian tube, they will be combined in a test tube. After the embryo is successfully formed, it will be transferred back to the uterus for the embryo to implant and develop into a fetus.; Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI): A good quality sperm is selected to be injected directly into the ovum, helping to increase the likelihood of fertilization. After successful fertilization, the embryo will be cultured until the 3rd or 5th day and then transferred into the female's uterus to nest and develop into a fetus.; Assisting embryo hatching (AH): This is a method of thinning or opening the outer membrane of the embryo, increasing the embryo's ability to adhere to the uterine lining, thereby increasing the embryo's ability to implant.; Blastocyst stage embryo transfer (embryo day 5): Blastocyst stage embryo transfer (day 5 after egg retrieval), helps increase implantation ability, increase pregnancy rate and limit the risk of multiple pregnancy due to The number of embryos needed to be transferred is less than the number of embryos transferred on day 2 or 3.; In vitro oocyte maturation method: After oocyte retrieval, immature oocytes can be cultured directly in the IVF laboratory for about 24 - 48 hours to reach maturity. Only mature oocytes are capable of fertilizing sperm and developing into embryos.; Intrauterine insemination (IUI): This is a method of washing and selecting healthy sperm to inject directly into the woman's uterus to increase the possibility of conception.; Retrieve sperm by surgery in cases of male infertility.; Donate eggs, sperm, embryos...; Cryopreservation of embryos, sperm, ovum...\nReference: Can you have children if you are infertile?",
