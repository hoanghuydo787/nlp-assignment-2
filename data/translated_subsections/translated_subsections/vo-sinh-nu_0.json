    "subsection_content": "Female infertility is a condition in which a woman cannot get pregnant naturally after 1 year of regular sexual intercourse without using any contraceptive methods. One thing to note is that a woman's fertility gradually decreases over time, especially after age 35.\nMany large studies have confirmed that approximately 85% of women will conceive within 12 months. Based on the findings of this study, fertility is 25% in the first three months of unprotected intercourse and then this rate drops to 15% in the remaining nine months.\nTherefore, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) recommends that the examination should begin and that the couple should have sex without using contraception within 12 months or within 6 months for women over 35 years old.",
