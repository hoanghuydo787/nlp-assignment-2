    "subsection_content": "Female infertility can be divided into 2 groups, including primary infertility and secondary infertility, of which: (1)\nPrimary infertility is the case in which a woman has had intercourse with her husband without using safe methods within 12 months (or within 6 months for women over 35 years old), but has not yet become pregnant.; Secondary infertility is a case where a woman has had one pregnancy, but after that the couple had intercourse without using contraception but could not get pregnant again within 1 year.\nInfertility is a condition that can occur in any woman, the most common victims are girls with a history of hormonal disorders, cases of repeated gynecological infections, etc. In case of having had an abortion or abusing birth control pills... In one study, the most common factors leading to female infertility include:\nOvulation disorders account for 25%: Irregular ovulation or no ovulation is the cause of most cases of infertility. Ovarian problems may lead to ovulation disorders, or the problem may be related to the regulation of reproductive hormones in the hypothalamus or pituitary axis.; Endometriosis accounts for 15%: Endometriosis occurs when tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows in the uterus or in other places, possibly the abdominal cavity or ovaries. This tumor can cause swelling and bleeding, and the growth of endometriosis tissue can block the fallopian tubes, preventing fertilization, and scar tissue can cause muscle adhesion. It causes the patient to feel pain and have difficulty conceiving.; Pelvic inflammation accounts for 12%: Pelvic inflammation, infection of the uterus and fallopian tubes can be caused by some sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea, chlamydia infection... these diseases can damage the fallopian tubes, makes fertilization difficult; Fallopian tube blockage accounts for 11%: Blocked fallopian tubes prevent sperm and eggs from meeting or block the egg's path after it has been fertilized into the uterus, increasing the risk of ectopic pregnancy.; Other abnormalities in the fallopian tubes and uterus account for 11%: Some problems due to abnormalities in the fallopian tubes or uterus can hinder the egg's implantation process or increase the risk of miscarriage. Pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy such as uterine polyps, uterine fibroids, blocked fallopian tubes, deformed uterus, cervical stenosis or adhesions... can all be causes of infertility.; Hyperprolactinemia accounts for 7%: The pituitary gland can produce excess prolactin (hyperprolactinemia), which reduces estrogen production and can cause infertility.\nWomen who have had sex without using contraception for more than 1 year but are not pregnant need to see a doctor soon for advice.",
