    "subsection_content": "Infertility can happen to women of reproductive age, but there are a number of factors that can put you at higher risk of infertility, including:\nAge: There are two important factors in infertility treatment, of which the woman's age is one of them. As women get older, both the quality and quantity of their eggs begin to decline. After age 35, the rate of follicle ovulation increases rapidly, leading to fewer eggs and poorer quality. This condition makes it difficult to conceive, especially the risk of abnormal pregnancy increases in older women and the risk of miscarriage is also higher.; Smoking: Not only does it harm many organs in the body, smoking also increases the risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy, reducing ovarian reserve and egg quality. In addition, it also affects young children. If you are smoking or using similar products, you should stop before starting fertility treatment and becoming pregnant and afterward.; Body weight index (BMI): Being overweight or underweight can affect endocrine and metabolism and therefore affect the process of egg production and ovulation. In the case of overweight/obese women, exercising to lose weight can increase the frequency of ovulation (more regular menstruation) and thus improve the possibility of pregnancy. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome are often in this risk group. Another thing to note is that the rate of overweight and obesity is increasing day by day due to unreasonable diet and lifestyle. Changing lifestyle and losing weight is necessary before getting pregnant to help get pregnant easily, reduce pregnancy complications such as diabetes, high blood pressure, premature birth...; Sexually transmitted diseases: Sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhea can block the fallopian tubes, leading to infertility. Having unprotected sex or having multiple partners increases your risk of sexually transmitted infections and can cause fertility problems later in life. In particular, some diseases can be transmitted and cause illness to children as well as can cause birth defects (syphilis).",
