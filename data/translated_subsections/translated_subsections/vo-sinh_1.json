Primary infertility\nPrimary infertility is infertility in couples in which the wife has never been pregnant. When treating primary infertility, doctors need to rely on the cause in both the wife and the husband, then can provide appropriate intervention measures.\n2. Secondary infertility\nSecondary infertility is infertility in couples who have previously given birth (or been pregnant, including miscarriages). In cases of secondary infertility, the general psychology of couples is often relatively subjective in having more children. Because they think they've already given birth, the next time will be the same. In fact, many couples feel extremely confused and surprised when they discover their secondary infertility.",
