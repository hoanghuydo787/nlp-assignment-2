Causes in men\nProblems in the ejaculation process such as premature ejaculation, retrograde ejaculation, diseases such as cystic fibrosis, testicles not moving down into the scrotum or torsion of the cord.; Problems with sperm: Low sperm count, deformed sperm or abnormal sperm transfer... can all potentially cause infertility in men.; Suffering from male diseases: Prostatitis, balanitis, orchitis... are diseases that can easily lead to infertility in men.; Abnormalities in sperm production function: This is a common cause that can originate from testicular shrinkage, genetic defects, and diseases such as diabetes and mumps; Have had previous trauma or surgery to the testicles/groin area; Using a lot of alcohol: Alcohol abuse will reduce sperm quality and reduce libido. Toxins accumulated in alcohol will cause erectile dysfunction, directly affecting men's ability to have children.; Smoking: This is the leading cause of male infertility. Smoking causes sperm to weaken, deform or atrophy the testicles.; Frequently wearing tight clothes: This bad habit causes testicular temperature to increase, preventing spermatogenesis.; Unsafe sex: Rough sex, having sex many times continuously will damage the penis, hindering the reproductive process of men.; Excessive exposure to chemicals and toxins such as pesticides, radiation, marijuana... and steroids.; Damage caused by cancer and its treatment; In some cases of male infertility, the cause cannot be determined, which may be due to genetic causes.; Stress: Prolonged tension and stress will disrupt male hormones, making sex less fulfilling and increasing the risk of infertility.

Causes in women\nFemale infertility often stems from causes such as:\nAbnormal ovulation: Menstrual cycle does not ovulate due to the influence of the hypothalamic - pituitary - ovarian axis.; Fallopian tubes: Diseases that can cause damage to the fallopian tubes such as genital tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases, history of pelvic and fallopian tube surgery, endometriosis in the fallopian tubes , congenital abnormalities of the fallopian tubes or due to sterilization; Uterus: Poor mucus, anti-sperm antibodies, damage to the cervix due to surgical intervention (electrocautery, cone removal...), short cervix.; Caused by endometriosis; Unknown cause: About 10% of infertility cases in women cannot find a cause after examining and conducting many necessary tests for exploration and diagnosis.",
