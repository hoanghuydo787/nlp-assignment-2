If there are no sperm in the ejaculation, sperm is usually collected directly from the testicles or epididymis through sperm retrieval techniques.; Infection treatment: This is an antibiotic treatment, capable of treating reproductive tract infections. However, not all cases can restore fertility.; Treatment methods related to sexual problems: This method is applied to cases of erectile dysfunction or ejaculation disorders that can be improved with medication or doctor's consultation. fertility.; Hormone treatment and medication: Your doctor may recommend hormone replacement or medication in cases of male infertility caused by high or low levels of hormones; or problems related to how the body responds to those hormones.\n2. Treatment of female infertility\n1. Fertility drugs\nYour doctor will stimulate women to ovulate with fertility drugs. This medication is the main treatment for women with infertility due to ovulation disorders. Medicines that regulate or induce ovulation will be selected by the obstetrician for use during treatment.; However, these medications both have benefits and risks. Prescription medications used to treat ovulation problems include gonadotropins (such as Gonal-F, Follistim, Humegon, and Pregnyl), clomiphene citrate (Clomid, Serophene), etc. (4); These medications will help women get pregnant by stimulating the ovaries to release more eggs. Normally only one egg is released each month. Your doctor may use gonadotropins if a woman has unexplained infertility or when other treatments have not been effective in getting pregnant.; Metformin (Glucophage) is another medication that can help normal ovulation if you have insulin resistance or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\n2. Surgery\nSurgery helps restore fertility in women. Uterine problems such as endometrial polyps and uterine fibroids may be treated with laparoscopic surgery. The doctor will use a thin endoscope with a probe attached to move it through the cut near the navel to remove scar tissue, endometriosis, open blocked tubes or remove ovarian cysts (which are sacs filled with fluid may form in the ovaries).\n3. Assisted reproductive methods\n1. IUI\nDuring uterine insemination, healthy sperm (washed with a special solution) is placed directly into the uterus during the time the ovaries release one or more eggs for fertilization. Depending on the reason for infertility, the duration of this process can be coordinated with the normal ovulation cycle or used in addition to some fertility drugs.\n2. IVF\nIn vitro fertilization (IVF) (5) is a popular infertility treatment technique. In it, the male sperm and the female egg will be fertilized in the lab to form an embryo. After a period of outside culture (about 2 - 5 days), the embryo will be returned to the female's uterus to develop into a fetus.\n3. Inject sperm into the cytoplasm\nIn the laboratory, sperm from the male is injected directly into the female's egg. This technique is often indicated when men have low sperm count. Pregnancy rate is from 20 - 40% per cycle. Success will depend on many factors such as female fertility and sperm quality.",
