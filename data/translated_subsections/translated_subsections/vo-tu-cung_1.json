Clinically, this condition includes:\nComplete rupture: The uterus has ruptured all layers of mucosa, uterine muscle and peritoneum, causing the uterine cavity to connect with the abdomen. The fetus and placenta are pushed into the abdominal cavity.; Subperitoneal rupture: The uterus is damaged in the lining and uterine muscle, but the peritoneum is intact. In this case, the fetus and placenta are still in the uterus.; Complicated rupture: Similar to complete uterine rupture but accompanied by damage to nearby organs such as blood vessels, bladder, rectum, ureters...; Uterine rupture in pregnant mothers with old surgical scars: The old surgical wound is partially cracked, with little bleeding. Usually the diagnosis is only made when there is a cesarean section or when the uterus is checked after vaginal birth.",
