    "subsection_content": "If uterine rupture is not detected early and treated promptly, it will threaten the lives of both mother and fetus.\nIn pregnant women, this condition causes blood loss, which can cause shock due to blood loss. This condition will be well controlled when pregnant women give birth at a medical facility with a good obstetrics unit.\nBesides threatening the life of the pregnant mother, uterine rupture also threatens the life of the fetus. Statistics show that 6.2% of perinatal deaths are related to uterine rupture. For that reason, when it is suspected that a pregnant mother has this condition, the obstetrician will prescribe an emergency cesarean section to save the fetus and promptly stop the mother's bleeding. If not taken out of the mother's womb quickly, the fetus's life will be threatened. (3)\nThe risk of pregnant women having a hysterectomy is also very high when the uterus is completely or complicatedly ruptured. Statistics show that in about 14-33% of pregnant women, hysterectomy is indicated, which will affect the ability to get pregnant and become a mother in the future.\nIn addition, when the uterus has ruptured, there is a risk of damage to the bladder, rectum, hypogastric blood vessels, and ureters during emergency surgery.\nDepending on each case, the doctor will prescribe appropriate preservation or hysterectomy",
