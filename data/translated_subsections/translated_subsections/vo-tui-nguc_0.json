    "subsection_content": "Breast Implant Rupture is a condition in which the breast implant is cracked, torn and the gel flows slowly, very slowly and rarely comes out, located in the dissection cavity, without causing bleeding. After a breast implant ruptures, the silicone can be inside the capsule (when limited by the surrounding fibrous capsule) or outside the capsule (when the silicon freely escapes).\nIntracapsular rupture occurs when the breast implant shell ruptures but the fibrous capsule remains intact. Silicon does not escape. This makes it difficult to detect ruptured sacs during clinical examination or mammography.; Extracapsular rupture can change the contour of the breast. This condition can be detected during a clinical examination or mammography.",
