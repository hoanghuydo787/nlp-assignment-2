However, ruptured silicone breast implants do not cause breast cancer, nor do they cause fertility problems or connective tissue diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.\nWhen silicone implants rupture, it is often silent and may go unnoticed because the silicone tends to become trapped in the surrounding breast tissue. This is called subcapsular rupture or asymptomatic silent rupture.\nHowever, surrounding breast tissue may become irritated and swollen. Fibrodermal scar tissue may also form.",
