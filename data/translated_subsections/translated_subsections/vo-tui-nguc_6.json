    "subsection_content": "If you have silicone breast implants and suspect that the implant may have ruptured, talk to your plastic surgeon. Imaging tests, such as a breast MRI or breast ultrasound, can show whether an implant has ruptured.\n1. Mammography\nIt is very difficult to detect cracks in breast implants (especially cracks in silicone breast implants) on mammograms. Detection of cracks in silicone breast implants in the capsule is almost impossible to see with this method.\n2. Ultrasound\nUltrasound may show signs of extracapsular rupture as silicone escapes and enters the mammary tissue. Ultrasound has poor sensitivity and specificity.\n3. Breast MRI\nBreast MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is the most sensitive method in detecting breast implant rupture. Using MRI to examine breast implant rupture may not require contrast injection. With the use of multiplanar imaging, MRI can also differentiate between radial folds or fissures.\nIn addition, contrast-free MRI can also differentiate between silicone implants and saline implants.\nBreast implants do not last forever.",
