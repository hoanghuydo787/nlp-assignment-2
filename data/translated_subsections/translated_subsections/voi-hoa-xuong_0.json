    "subsection_content": "Bone calcification or bone calcification is the accumulation of Calcium in body tissue, often occurring during the bone formation process. This condition can be a pathology or a natural sign of aging depending on each specific case. Calcified bones are the result of the body protecting itself, or in other words, a natural response to injury, infection and other autoimmune disorders. (first)\nIn general, calcified bones are a common form of degeneration, greatly affecting mobility and daily activities. If treatment is not carried out early, the condition can progress with many other serious complications, even irreversible. Among them, the two most common forms of bone calcification include:\nCalcification of the cervical spine\nThe cervical spine is responsible for rotating, supinating, bending, bending and balancing the head. Bone calcification occurs here mainly due to incorrect lying or sitting posture or injury.\nCalcification of the lumbar spine\nThe lumbar spine is very susceptible to calcification due to high pressure from body weight and damage caused by daily movements (walking, sitting, lying, carrying...). This condition often occurs commonly after the age of 40. In addition, young people who have the habit of sitting a lot and being sedentary are also at risk group.",
