If the spines grow deep inside, it can lead to spinal stenosis, making it difficult to stand upright and walk.; Calcification develops in the knees: Patients find it difficult to perform normal movements such as moving up and down stairs, getting in and out of cars...; Calcification develops on the heel: The patient finds it difficult to touch the ground or walk.; Calcification develops in the cervical spine: This condition causes arteries or veins to be compressed, blood flow to the brain is limited, and the trachea can also be pressed on, causing difficulty swallowing.",
