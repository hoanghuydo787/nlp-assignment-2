    "subsection_content": "Bone calcification becomes a concern when the location, shape or size causes tissue damage. Some typical complications can include the following:\nCalcification hardens and clogs blood vessels in the heart, brain, and kidneys; Gradual calcification leads to the formation of spurs and bone spurs in the paravertebral ligaments. When the size is too large, they will begin to compress the nerves, leading to muscle weakness and even loss of motor function in the long term. ; Irritation of surrounding tissues, leading to inflammation; Some cases of calcification spread to the shoulders, arms, and legs when nerves are compressed or damaged, causing severe pain.",
