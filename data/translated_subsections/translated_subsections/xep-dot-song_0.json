    "subsection_content": "Vertebral collapse or spinal subsidence is a condition in which the vertebral body cannot maintain its original height, causing damage to the spine and severe pain for the patient. Vertebrae collapse is related to age and seriously affects health. The disease can increase the risk of vertebral fractures, affecting mobility and even the patient's lifespan.\nVertebral depression is common in people with osteoporosis, specifically postmenopausal women. Therefore, the disease is often common in women, but many men also suffer from it and the incidence of the disease increases with age.\nAccording to the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF), by age 65, 1% of women and 0.5% of men will experience acute vertebral compression. People who have had a collapsed vertebra due to osteoporosis will have a second fracture risk up to 5 times higher than other people.",
