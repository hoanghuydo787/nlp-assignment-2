    "subsection_content": "There are many causes of collapsed vertebrae, but the most typical ones are degeneration, spinal injury and a number of other diseases. Specifically:\nOsteoporosis\nAge is the main cause of osteoporosis and is the leading cause of vertebral collapse. As bones become spongy and soft over time, the vertebrae are no longer strong enough to support the spine during daily activities.\nTherefore, when the patient bends down to lift an object, coughs or sneezes, it can also cause spinal collapse, if osteoporosis is severe.\nMost vertebrae collapse on the front, because the back of the vertebra is made of harder bone. That creates wedge-shaped vertebrae, which can lead to a hunched posture called kyphosis. (2)\nInjury\nSome other cases are not due to osteoporosis, but due to the vertebra being subjected to a large force causing injury. Specifically, traffic accidents, work accidents, falls in daily activities... The patient's position when falling is falling from a height, falling sitting and hitting the buttocks on the ground, causing collapsed and broken vertebrae.\nOther diseases\nVertebral collapse can also be caused by a number of malignant diseases such as bone cancer or metastatic cancer, Paget's deformed osteomyelitis, osteomyelitis... Cancer cells penetrate into the bone, causing structural destruction and makes bones weaker and brittle. This condition is common in people under 55 years old, with no trauma or minor trauma but with a fractured vertebrae.\nSome risk factors for spinal subsidence:\nRace: White and Asian women are at higher risk; Age: Women over 50 years old and the risk increases with age; Weight: Women with rickets and malnutrition; Early menopause: Women who reach menopause before age 50 have a higher risk of osteoporosis; Smokers are: Smoking causes loss of bone thickness, causing bones to weaken",
