Because some symptoms of collapsed vertebrae overlap with other conditions such as bulging discs, spinal stenosis, etc.). (3)\nThrough examination, depending on the level of subsidence, health status, and personal circumstances, the doctor will make the following treatment recommendations:\nConservative treatment\nPrescribe conservative treatment for patients by:\nImmobilized bed rest; Using pain relievers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, anti-osteoporosis drugs, osteoclast inhibitors...; Use a fixed brace\nHowever, this measure can also make vertebrae collapse worse due to progressive bone loss, causing muscle weakness... Especially complications arising from lying down for a long time, especially in the elderly, such as pressure ulcers , stasis pneumonia, embolism...\nInterventional treatment\nWhen medical treatments do not bring the desired effect, doctors will conduct surgical treatments as follows:\n1. Minimal intervention by injecting spinal cement through the pedicle or extrapedicular route with balloon (Kyphoplasty) or without balloon (Vertebroplasty). The liquid biocement will flow into the spongy bone trabeculae, then harden, ensuring the stability of the vertebrae.\nAccording to the 2018 German Orthopedic Association on conservative treatment, surgery for vertebral fractures due to osteoporosis is divided into 5 types:\nType 1 and type 2 subsidence fractures are stable fractures, mainly treated with simple cement injection.; Type 3 subsidence fracture (Unstable, incomplete rupture): If the patient can move and does not progress further, simply inject cement. If the patient cannot move, consider adding a posterior immobilization device.; Type 4 fracture (Unstable fracture): Cement injection combined with fixation with a long-configured posterior tool. Needle type: Posterior fixator with anterior column reconstruction; Type 5 fractures (Anterior column and PPL injuries): Use a long-constructed posterior instrument with cement injection or a short posterior instrumentation, only feasible in tension band principle situations or in combination with anterior reconstruction .\n2. Open surgery using a spinal screw fixation system (Regular pedicle screws, Hollow screws - Expanded screws with cement injection hole; Hook system, Titanium cage, Hard bone screws...).\nSpinal fixation surgery is indicated to treat cases of severe vertebral collapse causing major spinal deformity, and can be combined with nerve decompression when there is accompanying nerve damage.\nTreatment after surgery\nSurgical treatment only addresses the tip and symptoms of the disease. If the main cause of the disease is not treated, it will fall into a vicious cycle, costing money and damaging health. Therefore, besides treating symptoms and helping patients feel more comfortable, after surgery, doctors also require:\nTreatment of osteoporosis with bone resorption inhibitors, biphosphonate osteoporosis treatment; Treatment through nutritional measures; Coordinate appropriate physical therapy, rehabilitation, and movement exercises",
