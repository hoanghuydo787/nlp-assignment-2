    "subsection_content": "In general, localized scleroderma is recognized by the appearance of patches of discolored skin that are thick and may be oval in shape. The inside is usually red, the outer edge can be lilac. Towards the center of the oval, the color gradually changes to white or yellow. Exact symptoms will vary depending on the severity and type of injury, as follows:\nPlaque morphea: This is the most common type, usually appearing with 3-4 oval plaques, painless but can cause itching.; Generalized plaque morphea: This is a type of sclerosis with more widespread damage, affecting deeper tissues and potentially leading to deformity.; Deep scleroderma (Pansclerotic morphea): This type progresses rapidly with many plaques covering almost the entire body (except the hands and feet) and requires prompt treatment.; Linear morphea: The characteristic symptom is a thick, discolored band of skin, often on the arms, legs or forehead. This type is often found in school-aged children. The damage can spread to subcutaneous tissue, even muscles, bones and lead to deformities. In addition, if this condition appears on the face, it can cause problems related to teeth and eyes.\nIf the patient notices hard and red patches appearing on the skin, they should immediately contact a doctor for early examination. Early diagnosis and treatment will slow the progression of the disease. In addition, this also helps doctors identify and control complications before the condition becomes more serious.",
