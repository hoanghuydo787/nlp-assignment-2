    "subsection_content": "For localized scleroderma, the doctor will initially examine the affected skin area and ask some questions related to symptoms. Then, several diagnostic methods can be performed to reach the most accurate conclusion, including:\nBlood tests: Blood tests help doctors distinguish this condition from some other diseases.; Ultrasound: 10 - 25 MHz ultrasound can determine the thickness of the skin, correlating with the severity of the disease.; X-ray: X-ray is the preferred diagnostic method for cases of band sclerosis or localized scleroderma that has gone deep inside, affecting the bones.; EEG: An EEG will show abnormalities in people with cranial sclerosis, often localized to areas of the brain below the affected skin and sometimes without a history of seizures. clinical.; Skin biopsy: A small sample of skin will be examined to identify abnormal changes, such as excessive dermal collagen.\nIf a young child has this sclerosis in the head and neck area, parents should take their child for regular eye examinations because the disease can easily cause eye damage that is difficult to detect but cannot be recovered. In addition, patients can also have ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging to monitor disease progression as well as improvement after treatment.",
