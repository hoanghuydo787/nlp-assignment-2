Diffuse scleroderma\nDiffuse systemic scleroderma is a fibrosis condition that affects large areas of the skin, including the skin of the whole body, the skin of the upper arms and the legs... Internal organs such as the kidneys, lungs, heart and digestive tract can also be damaged. At this time, the skin becomes tight, often accompanied by dryness and itching. Patients may also feel musculoskeletal pain. Acute systemic high blood pressure can cause kidney damage. The disease becomes life-threatening if the lungs or heart are seriously affected.\n2. Scleroderma is limited to the skin\nScleroderma limited to the skin is the most common type of scleroderma. Fibrosis only affects the skin in certain areas: Hands, arms and face. However, in rare cases, scleroderma limited to the skin can cause other problems and is called CREST syndrome:\nC – Calcinosis (calcification nodules): Calcium deposition forms small tumors that appear in connective tissues; R – Raynaud's phenomenon (Raynaud's phenomenon): Hands and feet are anemic, turning white, blue-purple; E – Esophageal dysfunction: Causes difficulty in swallowing; S – Sclerodactyly (stiff fingers): Proliferation creates excess collagen in the skin, causing the fingers to become thick and stiff; T – Telangiectasia (telangiectasia): Small blood vessels swell and dilate, causing small red spots to appear on the hands and face.\n3. Sinusoidal scleroderma\nSine sclerosis is a phenomenon that occurs when fibrosis only affects internal organs, but does not affect the skin.",
