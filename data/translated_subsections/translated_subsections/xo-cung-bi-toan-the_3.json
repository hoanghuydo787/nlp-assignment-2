    "subsection_content": "The symptoms and severity of systemic sclerosis will vary from person to person.\n1. Skin\nThe skin is the most obvious manifestation of scleroderma. The skin of a person with the disease will appear in patches that are tight, hard and shiny, limiting movement. Skin patches are oval, large or small.\n2. Fingers and toes\nRaynaud's phenomenon results from scleroderma limited to the skin. At this time, small blood vessels in the fingers and toes begin to contract (especially when exposed to cold), causing pain or numbness, and turning blue/white/red.\n3. Digestive tract\nSystemic scleroderma can affect some parts or the entire digestive tract, causing problems in:\nEsophagus: Acidity or difficulty swallowing; Intestinal: Bloating, diarrhea, constipation...; Nutritional deficiencies.\n4. Heart, lungs and kidneys\nSystemic scleroderma can affect other organs, including the heart, lungs, and kidneys. When it develops to this stage, the disease can be life-threatening if not treated, especially damage to the kidneys.",
