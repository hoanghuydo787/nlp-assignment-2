(2)\nLocalized scleroderma\nLocalized scleroderma usually only affects the skin. However, tissue damage has the potential to deeply affect structures below the skin, including subcutaneous tissue, connective tissue, muscle or bone. Skin damage in people with localized scleroderma can gradually improve over time. These lesions can even disappear on their own, without needing treatment. Localized scleroderma is divided into two types:\nPlaque sclerosis (morphea): The disease is characterized by patches limited to one area of ​​the body, oval in shape, with red edges, and a thick and pale yellow center. In a few cases, it can affect blood vessels and internal organs; Linear scleroderma: The disease often begins with a line or streak of thick, hard skin on the arms, legs, or face. Sometimes, the disease also causes long wrinkles on the head or neck. This is a form of scleroderma en coup de saber because it has a similar shape to a scar from being slashed. This condition often appears on both the surface and deeper layers of the skin, sometimes even into the moving joints underneath.\nGeneralized scleroderma\nDiffuse scleroderma: The disease progresses rapidly, often affecting the skin in the middle part of the body such as the thighs, arms, hands and feet. This condition also affects organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract.; Limited scleroderma (CREST syndrome): The disease often affects the face, hands and feet. Some cases can cause damage to the lungs, intestines, esophagus and stomach. Patients show signs of skin calcification, esophageal dysfunction, Raynaud's phenomenon, finger stiffness, and telangiectasia.",
