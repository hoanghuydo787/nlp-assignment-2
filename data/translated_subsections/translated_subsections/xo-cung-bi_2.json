    "subsection_content": "Doctors have not yet found the cause of scleroderma. This is a type of autoimmune disease, which occurs when the immune system, which is supposed to protect the body from germs, now causes skin inflammation and damage to other parts of the body. The cause of the disease may be due to a combination of many factors such as:\nAbnormalities in the immune system: When sick, the immune system stimulates the activity of young fibrous cells to overproduce collagen. These substances deposit around cells, blood vessels, and organs, leading to damage and fibrosis in the deposition area.; Abnormal gene structure: Abnormal structure of some genes leads to the occurrence and progression of scleroderma; Environmental stimuli: Frequent exposure to environmental factors such as viruses, chemicals, and organic solvents for long periods of time can be the cause of the disease.; Hormonal factors: The disease often occurs in women aged 30 - 35, the rate is 7 - 12 times higher than in men. Therefore, female sex hormones, especially estrogen, can also be a factor leading to the formation of scleroderma.; Autoantibodies: Common autoantibodies in scleroderma are antinuclear antibodies, anti-Scl-70 antibodies, and anti-centromere antibodies.",
