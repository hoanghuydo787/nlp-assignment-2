This leads to permanent damage to the fingertips, causing pits or ulcers on the fingers. Some serious cases may require finger tip or limb amputation; Lungs: Scarring of lung tissue can impair lung function, causing increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries.; Kidney: When the disease affects the kidneys, the patient may experience increased blood pressure, increased protein in the urine, and can even lead to rapid kidney failure.; Heart: Scarring of heart tissue will result in increased abnormal heart rate, congestive heart failure, and pericarditis. Scleroderma also has the ability to increase pressure on the right side of the heart, causing damage to heart tissue.; Digestive system: Scleroderma can lead to heartburn and difficulty swallowing. In addition, patients may also experience bloating, constipation or diarrhea.; Sexual function: Men with the disease may suffer from erectile dysfunction. In women, scleroderma can reduce vaginal lubrication and contractions, causing difficulty during sexual intercourse.",
