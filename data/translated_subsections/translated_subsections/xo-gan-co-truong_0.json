These dead cells are considered the main cause of the liver's almost complete decline in important functions for the body such as purification, protein creation, blood filtering and cleansing, and fighting infections.\nCommon causes of cirrhosis with ascites and subjects at high risk of cirrhosis with ascites include: Viral hepatitis B, or C and alcohol.",
