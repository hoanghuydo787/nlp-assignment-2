    "subsection_content": "Compensated cirrhosis often has no obvious symptoms. Therefore, at this stage, if you want to detect the disease, in addition to clinical diagnosis, the doctor will prescribe a number of necessary tests such as:\n1. Liver biochemical test\nBiochemistry tests are aimed at checking the indicators of albumin, blood clotting, bilirubin, liver enzymes, etc., thereby diagnosing the health of the liver, determining whether the patient has compensated cirrhosis or another liver disease. Any other liver?\n2. Ultrasound and measurement of liver stiffness (liver elastography)\nWhen the liver has fibrosis and cirrhosis, it will become harder and no longer soft as usual. Measuring liver elasticity or fibrosis helps detect compensated cirrhosis. Liver ultrasound shows indirect images of the liver such as: irregular liver edges, intermittent veins, enlarged spleen... In addition, liver ultrasound also helps detect liver tumors caused by liver cancer in patients with cirrhosis.\n3. Liver biopsy\nThis way of diagnosing compensated cirrhosis is done by taking a few small tissue samples from the liver parenchyma for tests. This method today is mainly only performed in cases of compensated cirrhosis without clear cause.",
