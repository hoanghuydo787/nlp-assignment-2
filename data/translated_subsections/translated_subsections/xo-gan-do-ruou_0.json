This is the most dangerous alcohol-related liver disease, occurring after a long period of drinking too much alcohol. Scar tissue forms from alcohol damage and grows silently, gradually taking up all the living space of healthy cells in the liver. Over time, the liver loses its ability to regenerate itself, detoxify, and does not create enough protein for the body. However, if the patient detects early and stops drinking alcohol, liver function can still be maintained well.",
