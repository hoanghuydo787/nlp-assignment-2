    "subsection_content": "Dr. Khanh recommends that alcoholic cirrhosis not only impairs important functions of the liver (detoxification, metabolism, blood clotting...) but also leads to many dangerous complications such as:\nJaundice, one of the complications that can occur in people with alcoholic cirrhosis.\nYellow skin, yellow eyes; Loss of muscle tone (muscle atrophy); Gastrointestinal bleeding: Due to ruptured esophageal or gastric varices. This complication is a consequence of portal hypertension due to alcoholic cirrhosis; Ascitic fluid infection: Occurs when the abdominal fluid becomes infected; Multimembrane effusion: pleural, pericardial; Hepatic encephalopathy (severe, hepatic coma): When liver function declines, causing accumulation of toxins and other metabolic intermediates in the blood, the brain and central nervous system will be damaged; Hepatorenal syndrome, liver cancer...\nThese complications not only cause economic costs and difficulties in the care and treatment process, but are also dangerous to the patient's life.",
