    "subsection_content": "Chronic liver disease will lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis has two stages, the first stage is compensated and the second stage is decompensated cirrhosis. Decompensated cirrhosis is a severe progression of cirrhosis; compensated cirrhosis often has no or atypical symptoms. Decompensated cirrhosis is characterized by signs: jaundice, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and bleeding due to variceal rupture. With compensated cirrhosis, the patient often does not notice any symptoms because the organs still function normally. On the contrary, when progressing to the decompensated stage, serious liver function and complications can occur.\nFor this condition, the patient requires immediate medical care and treatment with a prolonged hospital stay. In addition, decompensated cirrhosis has a high risk of death, up to 20-50% depending on the type of complications. Therefore, early monitoring, detection and treatment is really important.",
