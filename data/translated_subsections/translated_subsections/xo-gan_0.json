The liver will try to restore itself after each injury. This recovery process will form scar tissue. The longer the injury lasts, the more scar tissue is formed.\nFibrosis interferes with the normal functioning of the liver. Scar tissue blocks the flow of blood through the liver and slows the liver's processing of nutrients, hormones, drugs and toxins. It also reduces the production of proteins and other substances made by the liver. End-stage cirrhosis can be life-threatening. (first)",
