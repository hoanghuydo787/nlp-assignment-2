    "subsection_content": "Based on clinical, paraclinical and imaging characteristics, cirrhosis is classified into compensated cirrhosis and decompensated cirrhosis.\n1. Compensated cirrhosis\nCompensated cirrhosis is a condition in which the liver has been damaged but can still perform its important functions. Compensated cirrhosis is considered the first stage of cirrhosis, lasting for many years and often without symptoms. Symptoms, if any, are very faint, easily confused with other diseases such as fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, right upper quadrant pain...\nOver time, the level of liver damage will become increasingly severe and lead to many complications. Therefore, early detection and treatment to eliminate the cause of cirrhosis is very important to slow disease progression and restore liver function.\nLearn about cirrhosis with MSc.BS.CKII Le Thanh Quynh Ngan\n2. Decompensated cirrhosis\nDecompensated cirrhosis (often presenting with abdominal ascites, called ascites cirrhosis) is determined when the liver is diffusely damaged, largely fibrotic and no longer able to perform functions. Decompensated cirrhosis is a later stage of cirrhosis with symptoms that are much more obvious than compensated cirrhosis. At this stage, patients are also susceptible to dangerous complications, including liver cancer.\nFor compensated cirrhosis, treatments focus primarily on controlling symptoms and complications and preventing them from becoming more serious.",
