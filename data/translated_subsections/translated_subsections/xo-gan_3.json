Viral hepatitis\nChronic viral hepatitis currently accounts for the highest rate of cirrhosis in Vietnam. In particular, hepatitis B and C can progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Currently, the rate of people infected with hepatitis B and C in Vietnam is very high with about 10 million cases of hepatitis B and 1 million cases of hepatitis C.\n2. Cirrhosis due to alcohol abuse\nAlcohol abuse is one of the leading causes of cirrhosis. With the popular culture of alcohol consumption in Vietnam, alcohol was previously the most common cause of cirrhosis discovered. When introduced into the body, alcohol will slowly damage liver cells. Initially, alcohol can cause fatty liver, then chronic hepatitis and finally cirrhosis.\n3. Other causes of cirrhosis\nNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis: A form of hepatitis related to overweight, obesity, fatty liver and type 2 diabetes; Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: A form of hepatitis related to overweight, obesity, fatty liver and type 2 diabetes\nAutoimmune hepatitis: A condition in which the body's immune system attacks healthy liver tissue, causing liver damage; Autoimmune hepatitis: A condition in which the body's immune system attacks healthy liver tissue, causing liver damage\nDrug abuse, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs (acetaminophen, antibiotics, and some antidepressants) can lead to cirrhosis.; Drug abuse, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs (acetaminophen, antibiotics, and some antidepressants) can lead to cirrhosis.\nCirrhosis caused by parasites: Amoeba, malaria parasites and liver flukes are the most common parasites that cause damage to liver cells and lead to cirrhosis; Cirrhosis due to parasites: Amoeba, malaria parasites and liver flukes are the most common parasites that cause damage to liver cells and lead to cirrhosis.\nSome genetic conditions: Wilson's disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, hemochromatosis, Alagille syndrome, glycogen storage diseases... can cause cirrhosis; Some genetic conditions: Wilson's disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, hemochromatosis, Alagille syndrome, glycogen storage diseases... can cause cirrhosis.\nCirrhosis due to diseases that damage or block the bile ducts in the liver: Cholangitis, bile duct obstruction, cholangiocarcinoma...; Cirrhosis due to diseases that damage or block the bile ducts in the liver: Cholangitis, bile duct obstruction, cholangiocarcinoma...\nCirrhosis due to prolonged blood stasis: Heart failure, thrombophlebitis on the liver; Cirrhosis due to prolonged blood stasis: Heart failure, thrombophlebitis on the liver",
