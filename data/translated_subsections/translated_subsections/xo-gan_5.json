Cirrhosis can increase blood pressure in the portal vein, causing gastrointestinal bleeding and death.; Portal hypertension: Portal veins are veins responsible for transporting blood from internal organs (stomach, small intestine, large intestine, pancreas, spleen) to the liver. Cirrhosis can increase blood pressure in the portal vein, causing gastrointestinal bleeding and death.\nAscites, edema: Portal hypertension and hypoproteinemia can cause fluid accumulation in the legs (edema) and in the abdomen (ascites). Using medication and adopting a low-salt diet can help improve this condition.; Ascites, edema: Portal hypertension and hypoproteinemia can cause fluid accumulation in the legs (edema) and in the abdomen (ascites). Using medication and adopting a low-salt diet can help improve this condition.\nInfection: People with cirrhosis often have difficulty fighting infections. Prolonged ascites can lead to primary bacterial peritonitis. This is a serious infection with symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting...

Without timely intervention, this condition can lead to death.\nHepato-pulmonary syndrome (HPS): This dangerous complication is a combination of liver disease, dilated blood vessels in the lungs and abnormalities in gas exchange. Typical symptoms of this condition are difficulty breathing and lack of oxygen, which are worse when people with cirrhosis are in an upright position.
