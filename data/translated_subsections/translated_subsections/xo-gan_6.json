    "subsection_content": "To diagnose cirrhosis, your doctor will first ask about your medical history as well as the medications (prescription and non-prescription), supplements or herbal products the patient is using. Carefully investigating these issues helps doctors detect and pay attention to a number of factors that can increase the risk of cirrhosis, such as a long-term history of alcohol abuse, injection drug abuse, or having had hepatitis B or C. .\nNext, the doctor may ask the patient to perform a number of examinations and tests to diagnose the disease and determine the extent of liver damage, including:\n1. Physical examination\nDoctors look for signs and symptoms of cirrhosis including: yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes; spider veins on the skin; dark spots on the skin; red palms; pain and swelling in the abdomen…\n2. Blood test\nBlood tests diagnose cirrhosis\nIf cirrhosis is suspected, the doctor will prescribe blood tests to check for liver problems. Signs of liver damage include:\nLevels of albumin and clotting factors are lower than normal; Increased liver enzyme levels (suggesting inflammation); Bilirubin level increases; Lower sodium levels; Higher iron levels (may indicate hemoglobinopathy).; Presence of autoantibodies (may indicate autoimmune hepatitis or primary cholestatic cirrhosis).; High white blood cell count (possibility of infection).; High creatinine levels (a sign of kidney disease – suggestive of end-stage cirrhosis).; Increased alpha-fetoprotein levels (may indicate the presence of liver cancer).\nIn addition, blood tests also help find signs of anemia due to internal bleeding or to check for hepatitis B or C through viral hepatitis tests.\n3. Imaging tests\nImaging tests show the size, shape and texture of the liver, and help determine liver scarring, the amount of fat in the liver and the amount of fluid accumulated in the abdomen. Imaging tests that may be ordered include general ultrasound, liver elastography, computed tomography (CT) and liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition, the doctor may also ask the patient to perform retrograde cholangiopancreatography to detect bile duct problems or upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to detect varicose veins or internal bleeding in the bile ducts. digestive organs.\n4. Biopsy\nA liver biopsy can confirm the diagnosis of cirrhosis, determine the extent of liver damage, or diagnose liver cancer.",
