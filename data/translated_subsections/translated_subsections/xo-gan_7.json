    "subsection_content": "Treatment for cirrhosis depends on the cause and degree of liver damage of the patient. The goals of treatment are to slow the progression of scar tissue in the liver, control symptoms, and prevent or treat complications of the disease.\n1. Treat the underlying cause of cirrhosis\nIn the early stages, treating the underlying cause can minimize damage to the liver. Some treatments include:\nUsing medications to control viral hepatitis: Medications to treat hepatitis B or C can limit liver cell damage caused by these conditions.; Alcohol withdrawal: People with cirrhosis should absolutely not use alcohol. People with cirrhosis due to alcohol abuse need to quit drinking alcohol. The doctor can advise or recommend an alcohol treatment program for the patient.; Weight loss: People with cirrhosis due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis need to lose weight and control blood sugar levels.; Using medications to control other causes and symptoms of cirrhosis: Some types of cirrhosis, such as primary cholestatic cirrhosis, respond well to medication treatment. Besides, doctors can also give patients some medications to reduce symptoms of cirrhosis.\n2. Treat complications of cirrhosis\nIn cases where cirrhosis has developed complications, the doctor will prescribe specific treatments depending on the type of complications and their severity.\nAscites and edema: A low-salt (sodium) diet and use of diuretic drugs, albumin infusion... can help control this condition. In severe cases, patients may need to perform procedures to drain abdominal fluid or reduce portal vein pressure by connecting the hepatic portal vein and superior vena cava.; Portal hypertension: Certain blood pressure medications can control portal hypertension and prevent gastrointestinal bleeding. The doctor may also ask the patient to have periodic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to identify varicose veins in the esophagus or stomach to have appropriate treatment options such as ligation of varicose esophageal veins.; Infection: The patient may be given antibiotics or other infection treatments. In addition, patients should be vaccinated against influenza, pneumonia and hepatitis A and B.; Hepatic encephalopathy: Some prescription medications help reduce the accumulation of toxins in the blood due to poor liver function.; Preventing liver cancer: The doctor may recommend that the patient have regular blood tests and ultrasound examinations to look for signs of liver cancer.\n3. Liver transplant surgery\nIn cases of advanced cirrhosis that causes the liver to lose its ability to function, a liver transplant is the patient's only treatment option. This is the replacement of a patient's damaged liver with a healthy donor liver.",
