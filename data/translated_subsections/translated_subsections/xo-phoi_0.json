The elastic, soft and spongy structure of the lungs helps bring oxygen from the air into the veins, and at the same time bring CO2 from the arteries to the outside. In addition to that main function, the lungs also help filter and remove toxins in the blood, store blood inside and metabolize biochemical substances.",
