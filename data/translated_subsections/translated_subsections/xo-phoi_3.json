    "subsection_content": "Explaining the mechanism of normal breathing, Prof. Dr. Ngo Quy Chau said that when inhaled, air will move to the lungs through large airways called bronchi. The bronchi divide into small respiratory branches called bronchioles, which end in clusters of air sacs called alveoli. At the alveolar walls are small blood vessels (also called capillaries) that will take place to receive more oxygen into the blood, and release CO2 - a waste product of metabolism.\nIn people with lung fibrosis, the alveoli are damaged and scarred, making the interstitial tissue hard and thickened, less flexible and shaped like a dry sponge, making it more difficult for the patient to breathe. There are many causes of lung damage causing pulmonary fibrosis, some common causes are:\n1. Polluted working environment\nLong-term exposure to toxic substances and pollutants such as silica dust, asbestos fibers, etc. can damage the lungs. Besides, chronic exposure to some organic substances including grain dust, sugar cane, animal feces... can also cause pulmonary fibrosis.\n2. Effects of radiation\nStatistics show that a small percentage of people with pulmonary calcification have ever undergone radiation therapy to treat lung-related diseases and breast cancer. The damage and the degree of impact of the treatment process depends on the area of ​​the lung exposed to radiation, the total number of radiation treatments, chemotherapy used, etc.\n3. Drug abuse\nAbusing certain drugs without a doctor's prescription can harm the lungs, especially chemotherapy drugs such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide; medications to treat arrhythmias and cardiovascular problems such as amiodarone, propranolol; psychiatric medications and antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin, sulfasalazine.\n4. Patients with related diseases\nSerious lung infections such as tuberculosis and pneumonia can cause permanent lung damage; Rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome and sarcoidosis, gastric reflux... affect all tissues in the body, including the lungs.\nBesides, some cases of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have unknown causes. Studies show that, although the exact cause of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has not been determined, there are a number of risk factors for the disease including:\nSmoking habits: Research shows that people who regularly smoke cigarettes are more likely to develop idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis than people who have never smoked.; Viral infection: Some studies have found that pulmonary fibrosis is caused by some viruses such as herpes, epstein-barr, mononucleosis virus...; Genetics: Some rare cases occur in families with a history of the disease.\nPeople who regularly smoke cigarettes are at high risk of developing dry lung disease",
