What is worrying is that the signs of the disease can be controlled and reduced, but the lung damage cannot be restored. The disease causes difficulty breathing and some dangerous complications for patients such as:\nReduces the level of oxygen in the blood to low: Lung fibrosis reduces the amount of oxygen added to the blood, the risk of lack of oxygen in the blood disrupts body activity, and can even threaten the patient's life.; Increased pressure on the pulmonary artery: When small arteries and capillaries are compressed, it will lead to increased vascular resistance in the lungs, increasing pressure in the pulmonary artery. This is a particularly serious phenomenon that can cause death to the patient immediately; Right heart failure: In case the right ventricle works harder and has a stronger pumping power than normal to move blood through the blocked pulmonary artery, it can lead to right heart failure.; Respiratory failure: Most of these cases occur in the late stages of chronic lung disease, when blood oxygen levels drop to dangerously low levels, which can lead to heart arrhythmia, causing unconsciousness and coma. deep.",
