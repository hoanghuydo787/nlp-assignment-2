Ways to collect biopsy samples include:; Bronchoscopy: The doctor will use a thin tube through the nose or mouth into the lungs. Note, this method when performed on adolescents can cause temporary sore throat and hoarseness.; Bronchial lavage: In this method, the doctor will inject saline through bronchoscopy, then immediately suction it out. The recovered material contained cells from the alveoli.; Endoscopic biopsy surgery: In some cases, patients are advised to perform endoscopic biopsy surgery to get the most accurate diagnostic results, although this is the most invasive diagnostic method. The doctor will use surgical instruments and a small camera inserted through two or three small incisions between the ribs to be able to view the lungs on a video screen while removing tissue samples from the lungs. The advantage of this method is that it does not require cutting the patient's bones, is less painful, has accurate diagnosis and faster treatment compared to traditional open surgery.",
