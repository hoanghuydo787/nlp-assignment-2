Treatment improves the patient's quality of life\nOxygen therapy: Breathing oxygen cannot prevent lung damage but is helpful for breathing, improving movement more easily, reducing complications, and improving the patient's sleep and spirit. Besides, oxygen therapy also helps reduce pressure on the right side of the heart, so patients may be prescribed this therapy depending on the severity of the disease and health status.; Pulmonary rehabilitation: The main purpose of this method focuses on exercise and effective breathing to improve shortness of breath and increase endurance during activities, not only treating the disease but also helping Improve and enhance the quality of life of patients in daily life.\nOxygen therapy helps improve breathing, mobility and reduce complications for patients\n3. Lung transplant\nA lung transplant is a last resort option for young people with severe pulmonary fibrosis that has not improved with other treatments.
