    "subsection_content": "When the density of LDL - Cholesterol or \"bad\" cholesterol - is too high for the body to eliminate completely, it will gradually accumulate in the coronary artery walls. At this time, the body sends a \"crew\" including white blood cells and other cells to the site of poisoning to handle the damage. Over the years, cholesterol continues to accumulate in the coronary arteries, and the body's reaction to it creates plaque. It is this plaque that narrows the blood vessels, obstructing blood flow and causing disease.
