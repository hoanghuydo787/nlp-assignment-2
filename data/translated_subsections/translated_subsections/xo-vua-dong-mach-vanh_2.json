    "subsection_content": "Coronary atherosclerosis usually does not cause any symptoms until the artery is severely narrowed or completely blocked. Many people don't even know they have the disease until they receive medical attention from an emergency, such as a heart attack or stroke.\nYou may feel symptoms if your coronary arteries are more than 70% blocked. This blockage causes blood flow to the heart to slow, resulting in the heart not getting enough blood.\nPatients need regular examinations to control the condition and receive timely intervention.\nSome early warning signs of atherosclerosis include:\nChest pain (angina) when exercising or doing heavy exertion. This pain usually stops when you rest; Shortness of breath; More tired than usual\nIf a coronary artery is blocked by a blood clot, you may face a heart attack with symptoms such as:\nSevere chest tightness; Pain in one or both arms spreading to the shoulder; Discomfort in the neck or jaw; Nausea and vomiting; Heart beats fast; Sweat; Dizziness or fainting\nWhen any signs of coronary atherosclerosis appear, or you have one of the risk factors for the disease, you need to go to the hospital for early examination for timely diagnosis and treatment.",
