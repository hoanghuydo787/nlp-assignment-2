(first)\nArteries are blood vessels that carry blood from the heart throughout the body; lined with a thin layer of cells called the endothelium, which allows blood to flow easily through the arteries. When the endothelium is damaged due to risk factors (such as the patient smoking or having high levels of fat or cholesterol in the blood, hypertension, diabetes, etc.), it creates conditions for plaque to accumulate. accumulation in the artery wall.\nOver time, the plaque hardens, narrowing the opening of the artery and restricting blood flow. When these fatty plaques break off, a thrombus (blood clot) forms, causing further obstruction or even blocking the flow of oxygen-rich blood to other organs and parts of the body.\nIf a thrombosis occurs in one of the two main coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart, this leads to a heart attack; If it occurs in one of the arteries to the brain, it will cause a stroke; and if occurring in the arteries of the limbs can lead to peripheral artery disease.",
