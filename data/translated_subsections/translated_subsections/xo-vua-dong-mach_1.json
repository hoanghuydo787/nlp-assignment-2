While the exact cause is unknown, atherosclerosis may start from damage to the inner layer of the arteries and is associated with risk factors.\nHypertension: Antihypertensive medications may be prescribed to help control hypertension as well as the need for dietary changes (such as reducing salt intake, etc.). Good treatment and control of blood pressure will reduce the risk of stroke and cerebrovascular accident.; Dyslipidemia: High levels of “bad” cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) can be controlled through cholesterol-lowering medications and dietary changes. Many studies show that lowering cholesterol, reducing bad cholesterol (LDL-c), increasing good cholesterol (HDL-c) will bring benefits in preventing coronary heart disease.; Obesity: May increase the risk of other factors such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol, which are also linked to atherosclerosis and other diseases.; Diabetes or insulin resistance: People with diabetes are twice as likely to develop cardiovascular disease. Controlling blood sugar in patients with diabetes may help reduce the risk of atherosclerosis.; Lack of physical activity: This contributes to weight gain and increases the risk of high blood pressure, increased bad cholesterol, causing atherosclerosis.; Poor nutrition: A diet high in saturated fat, as well as salt and sugar, can contribute to weight gain, causing obesity and increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease.\nSmoking changes the structure of blood vessel endothelium, causing blood fat to stick to the vessel wall, increasing the risk of atherosclerosis.\nStress: Can reduce the diameter of blood vessels, causing increased blood pressure. Chronic stress is also linked to cardiovascular disease.; Sleep apnea: A sleep disorder in which breathing stops for more than 10 seconds or reduces ventilation repeatedly during the night with symptoms of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness. This leads to increased blood pressure and puts stress on the cardiovascular system.\nAtherosclerosis is the main cause of cardiovascular disease.",
