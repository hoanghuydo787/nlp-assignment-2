    "subsection_content": "Atherosclerosis often does not cause symptoms until it is in an advanced stage. At this time, severe arterial narrowing causes blood flow to be interrupted and unable to be transported to organs and tissues. Cardiovascular disease also develops because of this. If an atherosclerotic plaque ruptures and forms a blood clot, it will cause a heart attack or stroke. (2)\nSymptoms experienced during atherosclerosis range from moderate to severe depending on which arteries are affected.\nCoronary atherosclerosis (to the heart): Patients will have angina, myocardial infarction, leading to heart failure if not treated.; Carotid atherosclerosis (to the brain): symptoms of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) that can progress to a stroke if not treated – sudden weakness or numbness in an arm or leg, slurred speech or difficulty speaking, temporary loss of vision in the eyes or drooping of the eyelids; Peripheral arteries (to the arms and legs): symptoms of peripheral artery disease (PAD), such as decreased blood pressure in the affected limb or numbness and pain in the limbs. PAD increases the risk of stroke or heart attack and in severe cases gangrene can occur, leading to amputation.; Renal artery (to the kidney): The patient will have high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease with symptoms such as anorexia, edema of the limbs, decreased urination...\nAtherosclerosis can also cause aneurysms anywhere in the body. While most people with an aneurysm have no symptoms, others may experience pain and throbbing in the area of ​​the aneurysm. If the aneurysm ruptures, internal bleeding is still possible and life-threatening. This usually happens suddenly, but sometimes a slow leak occurs.",
