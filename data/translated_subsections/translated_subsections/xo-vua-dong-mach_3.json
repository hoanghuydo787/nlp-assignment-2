(3)\nCoronary artery disease: Coronary arteries become atherosclerotic, causing narrowing and clogging, leading to chest pain, myocardial infarction, and heart failure.; Carotid artery disease: occurs when atherosclerosis narrows the arteries near the brain, causing transient ischemic attack (TIA) or cerebral infarction, stroke.; Peripheral artery disease: A condition in which the arteries in the legs or arms are narrowed or blocked, making the patient less sensitive to heat and cold, increasing the risk of burns or frostbite. In rare cases, lack of blood flow to the arm or leg can cause tissue death (necrosis).; Aneurysm: This is a serious complication that can occur anywhere in the body. Some medical emergencies may cause pain and throbbing in the area of ​​the aneurysm. Most people with aneurysms have no symptoms.; Chronic kidney disease: The arteries leading to the kidneys narrow due to atherosclerosis and this prevents oxygen-rich blood from reaching the kidneys, causing chronic kidney disease. This is a condition in which kidney function is impaired or stops working, unable to eliminate toxins and excess fluid from the blood.",
