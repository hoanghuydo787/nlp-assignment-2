In addition, the doctor may order some paraclinical tests, including: (4)\nCoronary angiography: A procedure that uses specialized catheters to inject contrast dye into the coronary arteries, thereby displaying images of the coronary artery system on a bright screen. These images help doctors evaluate damage to the coronary artery system such as stenosis, blockage, dissection, thrombosis... This method is considered the gold standard for diagnosing coronary artery disease.; Doppler ultrasound: This method is to evaluate blood flow, determine the narrowing of blood vessels in the abdomen, neck or legs.; Pulse wave velocity measurement: This compares ankle and arm blood pressure measurements to help identify any constrictions in blood flow. A significant difference means that the blood vessels are narrowed due to atherosclerosis.; Myocardial perfusion imaging: The method is conducted to record images in the resting state and the stress state, in order to detect, evaluate and predict myocardial perfusion status and some heart muscle diseases (cardiomyopathy) such as hypertrophy. myocardial hypertrophy, myocardial dilation; Computed tomography (CT): is a technique that uses X-rays, scanning cross-sectionally through the heart, to see if coronary artery calcification is present, which can suggest future cardiovascular problems. hybrid.",
