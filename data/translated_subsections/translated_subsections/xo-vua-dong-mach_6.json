    "subsection_content": "Dr. Binh said that treatments for atherosclerosis can include lifestyle changes, medications and surgery.\n1. Change your lifestyle\nLiving a healthy lifestyle is one of the important factors that help prevent the accumulation of plaque that causes atherosclerosis. Steps to a healthy lifestyle include:\nChoose heart-healthy foods: such as the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) eating plan. A heart-healthy eating plan includes prioritizing fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and limiting saturated fat, salt, and sugar.; Regular physical activity: Helps control risk factors such as high blood cholesterol, hypertension, overweight and obesity. Adults should participate in a total of 150 minutes or more per week of moderate physical activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous physical activity. Before starting any exercise program, ask your doctor what level of physical activity is appropriate for you.; Maintain a reasonable weight: Weight control can help patients control some risk factors for coronary heart disease, such as high blood cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure.; Limit alcohol consumption: Men should not drink more than 2 glasses of alcohol/day; Women should not drink more than 1 glass/day.; Stress control: Learn how to control stress, practice relaxation, improve mental and physical health.; Do not smoke and avoid secondhand smoke: Smoking is one of the risk factors for atherosclerosis. People exposed to environmental tobacco smoke or passive smoking also increase their risk by 20-30%. Besides, some studies show that nicotine and flavorings found in e-cigarette products can also harm the heart and lungs.; Get enough sleep: Adults should get enough sleep 7-9 hours/day. Deep sleep helps prevent atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases.\n2. Use medicine\nMedications that can be used to treat atherosclerosis include:\nAntiplatelet drugs aim to reduce the ability of blood platelets to stick together, causing blood clots; Anticoagulants to reduce blood clotting and thin the blood; Cholesterol-lowering medications to reduce fats (lipids) in the blood, especially low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol; Antihypertensive medications: Several groups of medications work in different ways to lower blood pressure.\n3. Angioplasty\nAngioplasty is a procedure used to restore blood flow to coronary arteries that are blocked or narrowed by atherosclerosis.\nThe nature of coronary angioplasty is a percutaneous intervention procedure, the patient is completely awake during the intervention process. The doctor will access the coronary artery system through the radial artery in the wrist or the femoral artery below the inguinal fold.\nA guiding catheter will advance and enter the left and right coronary artery ostia. A amount of contrast dye will be injected into the catheter so the doctor can easily see the narrowed artery. If the stenosis is localized and only occurs in the proximal segment, the doctor will insert the balloon at the location of the narrowed artery, then inflate it with the appropriate pressure level.\nAfter the balloon inflates, the atherosclerotic plaque will be pressed against the vessel wall. At this time, the doctor will insert the stent and pop it out at this location. The nature of the stent is a metal support, helping to maintain the ability to recirculate the newly released blood flow for a long time.\n4. Coronary artery bypass surgery\nCoronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) is a bypass surgery on coronary arteries that are severely narrowed or blocked but are not suitable for stent placement. The doctor will use a graft made of a vein or artery as a \"bridge\" to the back of the narrowed coronary artery. You can use the saphenous vein in the leg, the radial artery or the internal mammary artery inside the chest wall to make a graft.\nA doctor performs coronary artery bypass surgery on a patient at Tam Anh General Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City.",
