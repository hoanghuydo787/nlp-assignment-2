    "subsection_content": "Testicular torsion is a phenomenon in which the spermatic cord is twisted, blocking the path of blood transport to the testicles, thereby reducing blood flow, causing sudden and intense pain and swelling. This condition can occur at any age, most commonly in infants and between 12 and 18 years old. A twisted testicle requires emergency surgical intervention to avoid serious damage, leading to amputation. (first)\nIn terms of pathophysiology, this condition occurs when there is mechanical twisting of the spermatic cord, causing the testicles to hang in the scrotum in an abnormal position containing arteries and veins. Twisting will reduce or completely block blood flow to the organ. The degree of arterial and venous obstruction will depend on the duration and severity of the torsion.\nUsually, venous blood flow is compromised first. The increase in venous pressure then further reduces arterial blood flow. This leads to a decrease in the amount of oxygen supplied to the testicles, which, if not treated promptly, will lead to serious damage.\nMany studies also show that torsion can occur even during fetal development. This is one of the reasons why children are born with testicular deformities (only one testicle).",
