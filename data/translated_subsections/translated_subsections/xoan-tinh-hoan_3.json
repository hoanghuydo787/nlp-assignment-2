However, research shows that several risk factors may increase your risk of experiencing this condition, including: (4)\nA testicle that is larger in size.; Tumors appearing on the testicles, especially malignant tumors involving the spermatic cord.; Age: Testicular torsion often occurs in infants and adolescents between 16 and 18 years old (before or during puberty).; Certain congenital malformations or anatomical variations in the testicles or surrounding structures can also increase the risk of torsion, typically the “bell-clapper” deformity, which accounts for up to 90%. total number of cases.; Scrotal injury or heavy exercise, such as cycling (only about 4 - 8% of all cases).; Genetic.; Cold weather (still under research).",
