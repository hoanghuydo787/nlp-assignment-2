    "subsection_content": "Testicular torsion is an emergency condition. If not treated promptly, it can lead to many serious complications as follows:\nSevere testicular damage: Twisted testicles are at risk of serious damage due to reduced blood flow and lack of oxygen and nutrient supply to the organ. In case of necessity, the testicle must be removed to avoid widespread necrosis or tissue death.; Infertility: The impact of testicular torsion on long-term fertility is not yet fully understood. However, this phenomenon has the risk of affecting sperm quality, especially in adolescents and adults.; Causes damage to the remaining testicle: After one testicle is damaged, the body's immune system will be activated to clean up and heal. During this process, antibodies or proteins will be produced, potentially causing damage to the remaining testicle.; Reperfusion injury: This type of injury often occurs in tissues that have been deprived of blood supply for a long period of time.; Sepsis: In extremely rare cases (0.03%), if prolonged untreated testicular torsion can lead to sepsis, a serious and widespread infection that causes blood damage, neighboring organs, even death.",
