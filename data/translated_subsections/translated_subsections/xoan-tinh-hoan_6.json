    "subsection_content": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency, you should contact your doctor immediately when experiencing acute scrotal pain. Typical symptoms are sudden sharp pain. However, many patients will experience intermittent torsion, which means severe pain that then subsides. The possibility of recurrence is high so early treatment is needed; In particular, surgery is always the number one priority option in treating testicular torsion. Surgery needs to be performed as quickly as possible to restore blood flow to the scrotum. If blood flow is stopped for more than 6 hours, testicular tissue has a high risk of dying. The affected testicle must then be removed.; Untwisting surgery is performed under general anesthesia. The doctor will make a small incision in the scrotum, then remove the twist. Small stitches will fix the testicle in place in the scrotum, preventing torsion from happening again.",
