    "subsection_content": "According to research, 90% of cases treated for testicular torsion within 4-6 hours of pain onset do not require orchiectomy. However, if this process is performed after 24 hours or more, 90% of the testicles are at risk of being removed.; Orchiectomy can affect hormone production in the newborn and future fertility due to reduced sperm count. If the body begins to create antibodies due to torsion, sperm mobility is also at risk of being limited.; Therefore, to avoid serious complications, men should seek emergency medical care immediately if they suspect testicular torsion. The rate of successful surgery will be higher if detected early.",
