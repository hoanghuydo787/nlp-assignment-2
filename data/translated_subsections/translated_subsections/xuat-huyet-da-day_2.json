    "subsection_content": "Stomach bleeding comes from many different groups of causes. Mostly due to medical history, living habits, eating habits... Specifically as follows:\n1. Due to stomach disease\nPeptic ulcers are the main and most common cause of stomach bleeding, accounting for more than 40% of cases. Specifically, ulcers often develop on the stomach lining and upper small intestine, then acid will continue to damage, causing the condition to become serious.\nNormally, at a mild level of disease, small capillaries will be affected so the amount of bleeding is small and can be stopped without causing serious health effects. However, in the opposite case, many deep ulcers appear, callous ulcers affect the arteries, causing massive bleeding that is difficult to control. This is an alarming condition and the patient needs immediate medical intervention.\nCaption: Malignant tumor in the stomach causes bleeding\n2. Drink too much alcohol\nAlcohol directly affects the stomach and is one of the main causes of bleeding. Specifically, the body's tolerance of a lot of alcoholic beverages will cause the stomach lining to increase in permeability, thereby causing dangerous bleeding.\n3. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory pain relievers and Aspirin\nUsing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory pain relievers to treat bone and joint diseases or using Aspirin to prevent platelet aggregation can cause mucosal ulcers and lead to bleeding.\n4. Due to ruptured varices of the esophagus, stomach or duodenum\nRupture of esophageal, gastric or duodenal varices is one of the causes of stomach bleeding. Specifically, this is a complication of portal hypertension and enlarged veins in the lower esophagus (the tube connecting the throat and stomach). This condition occurs most often in people with serious liver disease such as cirrhosis. This is one of the common causes of severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding.\nSpecifically, esophageal, gastric, or duodenal varices develop when normal blood flow to the liver is blocked by cirrhosis or a blood clot in the portal vein. At this point, to pass, blood is forced to flow into smaller vessels (which are not designed to circulate such large volumes of blood). From there, blood vessels leak or dilate and rupture, causing bleeding and a direct threat to life. If too much blood is lost, the patient easily goes into shock and faces a high risk of death.\n5. Mallory Weiss syndrome\nMallory weiss (gastroesophageal tear) is the term used to refer to tears at the junction between the esophagus and stomach. This syndrome causes serious damage to the stomach lining, leading to bleeding and vomiting. Mallory Weiss syndrome is a non-contagious disease and will usually go away on its own in about 10 days without needing special treatment. The condition is at high risk in people who vomit a lot, such as after drinking alcohol or vomiting due to pregnancy.\n6. Other causes\nBesides the effects of stomach disease, stomach bleeding also occurs due to other causes such as: esophageal cancer, cancer, vascular malformations due to aneurysms in the stomach, such as vascular damage.
