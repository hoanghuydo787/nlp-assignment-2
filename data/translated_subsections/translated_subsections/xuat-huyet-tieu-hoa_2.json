    "subsection_content": "Gastrointestinal bleeding can come from many causes. Among them, the causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding often include: (2)\nPeptic ulcer: This is the most common cause of upper (high) gastrointestinal bleeding. Stomach ulcers are sores that develop on the lining of the stomach and upper part of the small intestine. They are formed by stomach acid, bacteria, or by using anti-inflammatory drugs that damage the mucous layer. Mallory-Weiss syndrome: Characterized by bleeding due to tearing of the esophagus due to excessive and forceful vomiting and is most common in people who drink alcohol and vomit continuously. Esophageal varices: Esophageal varices can cause bleeding due to rupture of dilated veins. This condition often occurs in people with severe, end-stage cirrhosis.
