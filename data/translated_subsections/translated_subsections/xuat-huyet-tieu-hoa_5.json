    "subsection_content": "In the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding, mainly follow the principles of respiratory protection, fluid replacement, and blood transfusion (in case of heavy blood loss); combination of medication. Some cases require endoscopy or embolization.(3)\n1. Protect the respiratory tract\nUpper gastrointestinal bleeding can cause disability or death if blood is inhaled. To avoid this risk, patients with a poor gag reflex, coma or loss of consciousness or undergoing gastroscopy should be considered for endotracheal intubation for ventilation.\n2. Fluid replacement and blood transfusion\nPatients with hypotension or severe gastrointestinal bleeding need to be rehydrated intravenously as soon as possible. A large needle will be inserted into a blood vessel at the elbow to infuse fluid with an average capacity of 500-1000ml of saline and in children a maximum of 2 liters (20 ml/kg).\nIn addition, in cases of severe anemia, patients need blood transfusions. However, in cases of coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, the elderly, and children, blood transfusions should be given. Consider carefully to avoid complications.\n3. Medicine\nFor upper gastrointestinal bleeding, patients are treated with intravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).\nFor cases of gastrointestinal bleeding due to varicose veins in cirrhosis, patients should be given visceral vasoconstrictors. .\n4. Stop bleeding\nAbout 80% of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding can stop the bleeding on their own, but the remaining 20% ​​of cases require specific treatment. Treatment depends on the location of bleeding and should be initiated early to minimize the risk of death, especially in the elderly.\nMethods to stop bleeding often include:\nStomach ulcer, bleeding or recurrent bleeding: Endoscopic treatment to stop bleeding locally using many different means such as using electric heat, chemical embolization, vasoconstriction, clamping. In more difficult cases, bleeding may need to be stopped by embolization or surgery. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to varicose veins: Treatment is by ligation, sclerotherapy or surgery to connect the two portal venous systems (TIPS). Severe, prolonged lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to diverticular disease or vasodilation: Endoscopy with clips, hemostasis with heat, electrocautery or injection of diluted epinephrine to stop bleeding. If there are polyps, they can be removed. Partial colectomy may be used depending on the case. Hemorrhage due to acute or chronic internal hemorrhoids: Analoscopy can be used for surgery or rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy injection to stop bleeding.; Stomach ulcer, bleeding or recurrent bleeding: Endoscopic treatment to stop bleeding locally using many different means such as using electric heat, chemical embolization, vasoconstriction, clipping.; In more difficult cases, bleeding may need to be stopped by embolization or surgery.; Gastrointestinal bleeding due to varicose veins: Treatment is by ligation, sclerotherapy or surgery to connect the two portal vein systems (TIPS).; Severe, prolonged lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to diverticular disease or vasodilation: Endoscopy with clips, hemostasis with heat, electrocautery or injection of diluted epinephrine to stop bleeding.
