Symptoms of this disorder are that even though there is sexual desire, the erection is not hard enough or not long enough to fully perform sexual activity.\nSexual dysfunction also has the phenomenon of \"the top tells the bottom not to listen\", the \"little guy\" can suddenly become erect while driving, sleeping, or working but when needed, it becomes weak and weak. eh.\nPremature ejaculation\nThis is a \"typical\" sign of physiological weakness causing ejaculation disorders. Premature ejaculation is considered when the penis enters the clitoris for only 2 minutes. Besides premature ejaculation, cases of not being able to ejaculate, difficulty ejaculating, and retrograde ejaculation are also considered physiological weakness.\nIf this condition lasts for a long time, it will greatly affect the psychology, causing feelings of inferiority, disappointment, and disappointment, which are feelings that gentlemen often experience. Premature ejaculation can occur at any age. The disease usually has two forms: primary (acquired in the early stages) and secondary (normal at first but develops again later).\nReduced sexual desire\nThis is a sign that gentlemen feel in themselves, no longer feeling excited, excited, even avoiding sex, \"answering questions\" in a sloppy way. According to experts, decreased sexual desire comes from many causes, one of which comes from age. The older you get, the higher the rate of decreased libido. This condition can occur in both men and women.\nAccording to statistics, about 43% of women and 31% of men have experienced decreased sexual desire.\nSee more: What is erectile dysfunction in women?\nPain during sex\nThe penis cannot achieve an erection, or scar tissue runs along the length of the penis due to erectile dysfunction, leading to a crooked penis, causing pain and loss of pleasure during intercourse. This also happens to people who frequently masturbate.\nNot satisfied after ejaculation\nAccording to experts, male orgasm often occurs in parallel with ejaculation. To achieve a feeling of satisfaction, this process must follow the process from low to high, from the stimulation stage (hearing, seeing...) causing the genital organs to secrete fluid to the high stage (sperm loading) through stronger touches.\nFrom there, more semen is secreted, stimulating the ejaculation process accompanied by a feeling of extreme joy. However, for people with weak physiology and problems with ejaculation, this procedure may not happen, and ejaculation problems are difficult to control. Orgasm is short-lived, or has just ended, causing feelings of disappointment and dissatisfaction.\nYou may be interested in: Is premature ejaculation a sign of erectile dysfunction?\nPhysiological weakness causes men to often not feel satisfied after ejaculation",
